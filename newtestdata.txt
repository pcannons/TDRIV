chapter 1


sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who
for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a
distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and
respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs
changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over
the almost endless creations of the last century and there
if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history
with an interest which never failed  this was the page at which
the favorite volume always opened

		     elliot of kellynch hall
walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth
daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of
gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth
born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still born son
november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791

precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer   hands
but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of
himself and his family these words after the date of mary   birth  
married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles
musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset
and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which
he had lost his wife

then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family
in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire
how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff
representing a borough in three successive parliaments
exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year
of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married
forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with
the arms and motto  principal seat kellynch hall in the county
of somerset and sir walter   handwriting again in this finale  

heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of
the second sir walter

vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot   character
vanity of person and of situation  he had been remarkably handsome
in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man 
few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did
nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with
the place he held in society  he considered the blessing of beauty
as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot
who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect
and devotion 

his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment
since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character
to any thing deserved by his own  lady elliot had been an excellent woman
sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot
had never required indulgence afterwards  she had humoured
or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real
respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest
being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends
and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of
indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
  three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy
for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to
the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman
who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle
close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice
lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of
the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously
giving her daughters

this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance  thirteen years
had passed away since lady elliot   death and they were still
near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower
the other a widow

that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely
well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage
needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not
but sir walter   continuing in singleness requires explanation 
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with
one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake 
for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing
which he had not been very much tempted to do  elizabeth had succeeded
at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother   rights
and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself
her influence had always been great and they had gone on together
most happily  his two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming
mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness
of character which must have placed her high with any people
of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister
her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way  
she was only anne

to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued
god daughter favourite and friend  lady russell loved them all
but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again

a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl
but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height
her father had found little to admire in her so totally different
were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin
to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none
of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely
connected herself with an old country family of respectability and
large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none 
elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably

it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than
she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any
charm is lost  it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter
might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least
be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth
as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else
for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and
acquaintance were growing  anne haggard mary coarse every face
in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow   foot
about lady russell   temples had long been a distress to him

elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and
directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given
the idea of her being younger than she was  for thirteen years had
she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home
and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after
lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country 
thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball
of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs
shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father
for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world  she had
the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being
nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions
she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever
but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced
to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within
the next twelvemonth or two  then might she again take up
the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth
but now she liked it not  always to be presented with the date of
her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister
made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it
open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes
and pushed it away

she had had a disappointment moreover which that book
and especially the history of her own family must ever present
the remembrance of  the heir presumptive the very william walter
elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported
by her father had disappointed her

she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be
in the event of her having no brother the future baronet
meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should 
he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot   death
sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures
had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it
making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of
their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom
mr elliot had been forced into the introduction

he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour
was confirmed  he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of
and expected all the rest of the year but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable
again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come
and the next tidings were that he was married  instead of pushing
his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot
he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman
of inferior birth

sir walter has resented it  as the head of the house he felt that
he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man
so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together
he observed once at tattersal   and twice in the lobby of
the house of commons  his disapprobation was expressed
but apparently very little regarded  mr elliot had attempted no apology
and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family
as sir walter considered him unworthy of it  all acquaintance between
them had ceased

this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval
of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man
for himself and still more for being her father   heir and whose
strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter
elliot   eldest daughter  there was not a baronet from a to   whom
her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal 
yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was
at this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons
for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again 
the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was
no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over
had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention
of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully
of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood
he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own 
this could not be pardoned

such were elizabeth elliot   sentiments and sensations such the cares
to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance
the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life
such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence
in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits
of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy

but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these  her father was growing distressed for money 
she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive
the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of
mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts  the kellynch property was good
but not equal to sir walter   apprehension of the state required
in its possessor  while lady elliot lived there had been method
moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income
but with her had died all such right mindedness and from that period
he had been constantly exceeding it  it had not been possible
for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot
was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was
not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often
that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially
from his daughter  he had given her some hints of it the last spring
in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench 
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which
we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first
ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done
and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off
some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing
the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added
the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne
as had been the usual yearly custom  but these measures
however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent
of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged
to confess to her soon afterwards  elizabeth had nothing to propose
of deeper efficacy  she felt herself ill used and unfortunate
as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise
any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity
or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne

there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of
but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference 
he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power
but he would never condescend to sell  no he would never disgrace
his name so far  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole
and entire as he had received it

their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in
the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments
and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of
any indulgence of taste or pride



chapter 2


mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold
or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable
prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint
and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to
the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense
he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as
he meant to see finally adopted

lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it
much serious consideration  she was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision
in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles 
she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour
but she was as desirous of saving sir walter   feelings as solicitous
for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what
was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be 
she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of
strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions
of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding 
she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking
rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry
she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little
to the faults of those who possessed them  herself the widow of
only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due
and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance
an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her
very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was
as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal
of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties

they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  but she was
very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him
and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations
and she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted anne
who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest
in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her
in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted
to sir walter every emendation of anne   had been on the side of
honesty against importance  she wanted more vigorous measures
a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt
a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity

if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell
looking over her paper much may be done  if he will adopt
these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope
we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has
a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions
and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from
lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle 
what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families
have done or ought to do  there will be nothing singular in his case
and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering
as it always does of our conduct  i have great hope of prevailing 
we must be serious and decided for after all the person who
has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to
the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father
there is still more due to the character of an honest man

this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding
his friends to be urging him  she considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with
all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments
could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it 
she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  she rated
lady russell   influence highly and as to the severe degree
of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed
there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete
than to half a reformation  her knowledge of her father
and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair
of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on
through the whole list of lady russell   too gentle reductions

how anne   more rigid requisitions might have been taken
is of little consequence  lady russell   had no success at all
could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort
of life knocked off  journeys london servants horses table  
contractions and restrictions every where  to live no longer
with the decencies even of a private gentleman  no he would sooner
quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms

quit kellynch hall  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd
whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter   retrenching
and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without
a change of abode  since the idea had been started in the very quarter
which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing
his judgement to be entirely on that side  it did not appear to him
that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house
which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would
be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way
he might choose to model his household 

sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more
of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go
was settled and the first outline of this important change made out

there had been three alternatives london bath or another house
in the country  all anne   wishes had been for the latter 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have
lady russell   society still be near mary and still have the pleasure
of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object
of her ambition  but the usual fate of anne attended her
in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her
and bath was to be her home

sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in london and had been skillful enough
to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred  it was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important
at comparatively little expense  two material advantages of bath
over london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient
distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell   spending
some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction
of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been
for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that
they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there

lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne   known wishes 
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house
in his own neighbourhood  anne herself would have found
the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter  
feelings they must have been dreadful  and with regard to anne  
dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising
first from the circumstance of her having been three years
at school there after her mother   death and secondly
from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter
which she had afterwards spent there with herself

lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think
it must suit them all and as to her young friend   health
by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge
every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must
do both health and spirits good  anne had been too little from home
too little seen her spirits were not high  a larger society
would improve them  she wanted her to be more known

the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood
for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part
and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily
engrafted on the beginning  he was not only to quit his home
but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude
which stronger heads than sir walter   have found too much 
kellynch hall was to be let  this however was a profound secret
not to be breathed beyond their own circle

sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known
to design letting his house  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word
advertise but never dared approach it again  sir walter spurned
the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on
the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour
that he would let it at all

how quick come the reasons for approving what we like  lady russell had
another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter
and his family were to remove from the country  elizabeth had been
lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted 
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned
after an unprosperous marriage to her father   house with
the additional burden of two children  she was a clever young woman
who understood the art of pleasing  the art of pleasing at least
at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot
as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all
that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place
could hint of caution and reserve

lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth
and seemed to love her rather because she would love her
than because elizabeth deserved it  she had never received from her more
than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance
had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry
against previous inclination  she had been repeatedly very earnest
in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open
to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements
which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured
to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience
but always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way and never had she
pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in
this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving
a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought
to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility

from situation mrs clay was in lady russell   estimate a very unequal
and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion
and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice
of more suitable intimates within miss elliot   reach was therefore
an object of first rate importance



chapter 3


i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd
one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper
that the present juncture is much in our favour  this peace will
be turning all our rich naval officers ashore  they will be
all wanting a home  could not be a better time sir walter
for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants 
many a noble fortune has been made during the war  if a rich admiral
were to come in our way sir walter  

he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter
that   all i have to remark  a prize indeed would kellynch hall
be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken
ever so many before hey shepherd

mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added  

i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  i have had a little knowledge
of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they
have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants
as any set of people one should meet with  therefore sir walter
what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of
any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated
as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep
the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice
and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd
might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it
worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him
which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much
i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if
with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad
in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications
will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy
naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add
that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you
the trouble of replying

sir walter only nodded  but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room
he observed sarcastically  

there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description

they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune
said mrs clay for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over
nothing being of so much use to mrs clay   health as a drive to kellynch 
but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be
a very desirable tenant  i have known a good deal of the profession
and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful
in all their ways  these valuable pictures of yours sir walter
if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  everything in
and about the house would be taken such excellent care of 
the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order
as they are now  you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own
sweet flower gardens being neglected

as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced
to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges
to be annexed to it  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant 
the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers
or men of any other description can have had such a range
but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds
is another thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being
always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard
with respect to her flower garden  i am very little disposed
to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour
i assure you be he sailor or soldier

after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say  

in all these cases there are established usages which
make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant 
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands  depend upon me
for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights 
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous
for his own as john shepherd will be for him

here anne spoke  

the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least
an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and
all the privileges which any home can give  sailors work hard enough
for their comforts we must all allow

very true very true  what miss anne says is very true
was mr shepherd   rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter  
but sir walter   remark was soon afterwards  

the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it

indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise

yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds
of objection to it  first as being the means of bringing persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours
which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly
as it cuts up a man   youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man  i have observed it all my life 
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise
of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to
and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in
any other line  one day last spring in town i was in company
with two men striking instances of what i am talking of
lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate
without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives
and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage
you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged
to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side
and nothing but a dab of powder at top  in the name of heaven
who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near
sir basil morley  old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin 
what do you take his age to be  sixty said i or perhaps sixty two 
forty replied sir basil forty and no more  picture to yourselves
my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin 
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do
but to a degree i know it is the same with them all  they are all
knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather
till they are not fit to be seen  it is a pity they are not knocked
on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin   age

nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed 
have a little mercy on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsome 
the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes
i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  but then
is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other 
soldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in
the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind
if not of the body which seldom leaves a man   looks to the natural
effect of time  the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician
is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even
the clergyman   she stopt a moment to consider what might
do for the clergyman  and even the clergyman you know is obliged
to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to
all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  in fact as i have
long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable
in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any
who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours
following their own pursuits and living on their own property
without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say
to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost 
i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness
when they cease to be quite young

it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak
sir walter   good will towards a naval officer as tenant
had been gifted with foresight for the very first application
for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards
fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed
he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make
admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired
a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country
and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places
in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him
that accidentally hearing  it was just as he had foretold
mr shepherd observed sir walter   concerns could not be kept a secret  
accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let
and understanding his mr shepherd   connection with the owner
he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries
and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong
an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description
could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself
every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant

and who is admiral croft was sir walter   cold suspicious inquiry

mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman   family
and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed
added  

he is a rear admiral of the white  he was in the trafalgar action
and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there
i believe several years

then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face
is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery

mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale
hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure
but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour
not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted
a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible
knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished
house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised
if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor
would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it
said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman

mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all
the circumstances of the admiral   family which made him
peculiarly desirable as a tenant  he was a married man
and without children the very state to be wished for  a house was
never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady 
he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering
as much where there was no lady as where there were many children 
a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture
in the world  he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton
with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were
talking the matter over

and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be
continued he asked more questions about the house and terms
and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant
with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite
unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once
she told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived
a few years back at monkford  bless me what was his name 
at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately 
penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman
who lived at monkford  mrs croft   brother

but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not
hear the appeal

i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember
no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent

bless me how very odd  i shall forget my own name soon i suppose 
a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman
so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once
i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer   man
breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen
caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement
submitted to an amicable compromise  very odd indeed

after waiting another moment  

you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne

mr shepherd was all gratitude 

wentworth was the very name  mr wentworth was the very man 
he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back
for two or three years  came there about the year    5 i take it 
you remember him i am sure

wentworth  oh ay  mr wentworth the curate of monkford 
you misled me by the term gentleman  i thought you were speaking of
some man of property  mr wentworth was nobody i remember
quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family 
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common

as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them
no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning
with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably
in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea
they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for
the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked
nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot 
an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in
the secret of sir walter   estimate of the dues of a tenant

it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with
an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms
he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty
and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained
at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen

sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough
of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant
in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer 
so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little
additional soothing in the admiral   situation in life which was just
high enough and not too high  i have let my house to admiral croft
would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr  
a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs
a note of explanation  an admiral speaks his own consequence
and at the same time can never make a baronet look small 
in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever
have the precedence

nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth 
but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal
that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her

mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had
such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener
to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her
flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said
with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps
may be walking here



chapter 4


he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford
however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth
his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action
off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire
in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home
for half a year at monkford  he was at that time a remarkably fine
young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy
and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste
and feeling  half the sum of attraction on either side might have
been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love
but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and
deeply in love  it would be difficult to say which had seen
highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest 
she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in
having them accepted

a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one
troubles soon arose  sir walter on being applied to without actually
withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all
the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence
and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with
more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one

anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind
to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen
in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself
to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances
of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure
even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away
which she grieved to think of  anne elliot so young known to so few
to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious
youth killing dependence  it must not be if by any fair interference
of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother   love
and mother   rights it would be prevented

captain wentworth had no fortune  he had been lucky in his profession
but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing 
but he was confident that he should soon be rich  full of life and ardour
he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station
that would lead to everything he wanted  he had always been lucky
he knew he knew he should be so still  such confidence powerful
in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it
must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently 
his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently
on her  she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  it only added
a dangerous character to himself  he was brilliant he was headstrong 
lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to
imprudence a horror  she deprecated the connexion in every light

such opposition as these feelings produced was more than
anne could combat  young and gentle as she was it might yet
have been possible to withstand her father   ill will
though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister
but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not
with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner
be continually advising her in vain  she was persuaded to believe
the engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable
of success and not deserving it  but it was not a merely selfish caution
under which she acted in putting an end to it  had she not
imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own
she could hardly have given him up  the belief of being prudent
and self denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation
under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation
was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions
on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself
ill used by so forced a relinquishment  he had left the country
in consequence

a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance
but not with a few months ended anne   share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every
enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits
had been their lasting effect

more than seven years were gone since this little history
of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had
softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him
but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given
in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture
or in any novelty or enlargement of society  no one had ever
come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with
frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory  no second attachment
the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure
at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind
the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society
around them  she had been solicited when about two and twenty
to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found
a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had
lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man
whose landed property and general importance were second in that country
only to sir walter   and of good character and appearance
and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more
while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two
so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of
her father   house and settled so permanently near herself 
but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do
and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion
never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety
which borders on hopelessness for anne   being tempted by some man
of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her
to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits

they knew not each other   opinion either its constancy or its change
on the one leading point of anne   conduct for the subject was never
alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently
from what she had been made to think at nineteen  she did not blame
lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her
but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances
to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such
certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good 
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home
and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears
delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman
in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it
and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs
without reference to the actual results of their case which
as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than
could be reasonably calculated on  all his sanguine expectations
all his confidence had been justified  his genius and ardour
had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path 
he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ 
and all that he had told her would follow had taken place 
he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank
and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority
but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy
she had no reason to believe him married

how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least
were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful
confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which
seems to insult exertion and distrust providence  she had been forced
into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older 
the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning

with all these circumstances recollections and feelings
she could not hear that captain wentworth   sister was likely
to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll
and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves
sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts
and their business no evil  she was assisted however by that
perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three
of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny
any recollection of it  she could do justice to the superiority
of lady russell   motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth
she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important
from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft   really
taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which
had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to
those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable
she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his
the brother only with whom he had been residing had received
any information of their short lived engagement  that brother had been
long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover
a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature  
having heard of it from him

the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying
her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary
had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by
the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge
of it afterwards

with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch
and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated
need not involve any particular awkwardness



chapter 5


on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft   seeing kellynch hall
anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell  
and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural
to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them

this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory
and decided the whole business at once  each lady was previously
well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore
but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen
there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality
on the admiral   side as could not but influence sir walter
who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished
behaviour by mr shepherd   assurances of his being known by report
to the admiral as a model of good breeding

the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts
were approved terms time every thing and every body was right
and mr shepherd   clerks were set to work without there having been
a single preliminary difference to modify of all that
this indenture sheweth

sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be
the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair
he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife
as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon
come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton 
the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be
no harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been
esteemed about equal

the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter
proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month
there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement

lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use
or any importance in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements
of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks
she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne
though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare
of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad
of the autumnal months in the country did not think that
everything considered she wished to remain  it would be most right
and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering
to go with the others

something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal
of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne
when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing
that she should not have a day   health all the autumn entreated
or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to
uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her
instead of going to bath

i cannot possibly do without anne was mary   reasoning
and elizabeth   reply was then i am sure anne had better stay
for nobody will want her in bath

to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to
be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty
and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country
and her own dear country readily agreed to stay

this invitation of mary   removed all lady russell   difficulties
and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath
till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time
should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge

so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled
by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her
which was mrs clay   being engaged to go to bath with sir walter
and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter
in all the business before her  lady russell was extremely sorry
that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered
grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne
in mrs clay   being of so much use while anne could be of none
was a very sore aggravation

anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt
the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell 
with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge
which she often wished less of her father   character she was
sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy
were more than possible  she did not imagine that her father
had at present an idea of the kind  mrs clay had freckles
and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually
making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young
and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind
and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions
than any merely personal might have been  anne was so impressed
by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself
from trying to make it perceptible to her sister  she had little hope
of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be
so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought
have reason to reproach her for giving no warning

she spoke and seemed only to offend  elizabeth could not conceive
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly
answered for each party   perfectly knowing their situation

mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is
and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be
i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are
particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition
and rank more strongly than most people  and as to my father
i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single
so long for our sakes need be suspected now  if mrs clay were
a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her
so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure
would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might
be rendered unhappy  but poor mrs clay who with all her merits
can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor
mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety  one would imagine
you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes
though i know you must fifty times  that tooth of her  
and those freckles  freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few
but he abominates them  you must have heard him notice
mrs clay   freckles

there is hardly any personal defect replied anne
which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to

i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly
an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never
alter plain ones  however at any rate as i have a great deal more
at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it
rather unnecessary in you to be advising me

anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless
of doing good  elizabeth though resenting the suspicion
might yet be made observant by it

the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter
miss elliot and mrs clay to bath  the party drove off
in very good spirits  sir walter prepared with condescending bows
for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint
to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time
in a sort of desolate tranquility to the lodge where she was to spend
the first week

her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this
break up of the family exceedingly  their respectability was
as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become
precious by habit  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds
and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village
and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived
she had determined to make her own absence from home begin
when she must give up anne  accordingly their removal was made together
and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage
of lady russell   journey

uppercross was a moderate sized village which a few years back
had been completely in the old english style containing only
two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees
substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage
enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear tree
trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire
it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage
for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda
french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch
the traveller   eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect
and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on

here anne had often been staying  she knew the ways of uppercross
as well as those of kellynch  the two families were so continually meeting
so much in the habit of running in and out of each other   house
at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course  though better endowed than the elder sister
mary had not anne   understanding nor temper  while well and happy
and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits
but any indisposition sunk her completely  she had no resources
for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot
self importance was very prone to add to every other distress
that of fancying herself neglected and ill used  in person she was
inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached
the dignity of being a fine girl  she was now lying on the faded sofa
of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which
had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers
and two children and on anne   appearing greeted her with  

so you are come at last  i began to think i should never see you 
i am so ill i can hardly speak  i have not seen a creature
the whole morning

i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne  you sent me
such a good account of yourself on thursday

yes i made the best of it i always do  but i was very far from well
at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life
as i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone i am sure 
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way
and not able to ring the bell  so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer

anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
oh charles is out shooting  i have not seen him since seven o clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was  he said he should not
stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one 
i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning

you have had your little boys with you

yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good  little charles does not mind
a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad

well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come  how are your neighbours
at the great house

i can give you no account of them  i have not seen one of them to day
except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window
but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was
not one of them have been near me  it did not happen to suit
the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves
out of their way

you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it is early

i never want them i assure you  they talk and laugh a great deal
too much for me  oh anne i am so very unwell  it was quite unkind
of you not to come on thursday

my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well
and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware
that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last 
and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy
have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have
left kellynch sooner

dear me what can you possibly have to do

a great many things i assure you  more than i can recollect
in a moment but i can tell you some  i have been making
a duplicate of the catalogue of my father   books and pictures 
i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie
trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth   plants
are for lady russell  i have had all my own little concerns
to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack
from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons 
and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature 
going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave 
i was told that they wished it  but all these things took up
a great deal of time

oh well and after a moment   pause but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday

did you go then  i have made no enquiries because i concluded
you must have been obliged to give up the party

oh yes i went  i was very well yesterday nothing at all
the matter with me till this morning  it would have been strange
if i had not gone

i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party

nothing remarkable  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be
and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having
a carriage of one   own  mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were
so crowded  they are both so very large and take up so much room
and mr musgrove always sits forward  so there was i crowded into
the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely
that my illness to day may be owing to it

a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness
on anne   side produced nearly a cure on mary    she could soon
sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able
to leave it by dinner time  then forgetting to think of it
she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay
then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough
to propose a little walk

where shall we go said she when they were ready  i suppose
you will not like to call at the great house before they have
been to see you

i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know
so well as mrs and the miss musgroves

oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  however
we may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we
have that over we can enjoy our walk

anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence
neither family could now do without it  to the great house accordingly
they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour
with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present
daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion
by a grand piano forte and a harp flower stands and little tables
placed in every direction  oh could the originals of the portraits
against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and
the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness  the portraits themselves
seemed to be staring in astonishment

the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration
perhaps of improvement  the father and mother were in the old
english style and the young people in the new  mr and mrs musgrove
were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable
not much educated and not at all elegant  their children had
more modern minds and manners  there was a numerous family
but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa
young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter
all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands
of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry 
their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty
their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant
they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad 
anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures
of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some
comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility
of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant
and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing
but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together
that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known
so little herself with either of her sisters

they were received with great cordiality  nothing seemed amiss
on the side of the great house family which was generally
as anne very well knew the least to blame  the half hour was
chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised
at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both
the miss musgroves at mary   particular invitation



chapter 6


anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles
will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea 
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it
or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage
in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs
which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity
and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed
she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing
our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her
for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject
which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found
in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove 
so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath
do you think they will settle in and this without much
waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of
i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa
if we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your
queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of  
upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away
to be happy at bath

she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future
and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing
of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell

the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy
their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females
were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping
neighbours dress dancing and music  she acknowledged it to be
very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate
its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become
a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into 
with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross
it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory
and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible

she had no dread of these two months  mary was not so repulsive
and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers
neither was there anything among the other component parts
of the cottage inimical to comfort  she was always on friendly terms
with her brother in law and in the children who loved her nearly as well
and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had
an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion

charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation
or grace to make the past as they were connected together
at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time
anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match
might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding
might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness
rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  as it was
he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise
trifled away without benefit from books or anything else 
he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by
his wife   occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness
sometimes to anne   admiration and upon the whole though there was
very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share
than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass
for a happy couple  they were always perfectly agreed in the want
of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present
from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority
for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made
he always contended for his father   having many other uses for his money
and a right to spend it as he liked

as to the management of their children his theory was much better
than his wife   and his practice not so bad  i could manage them
very well if it were not for mary   interference was what
anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in
but when listening in turn to mary   reproach of charles spoils
the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had
the smallest temptation to say very true

one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there
was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties
and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house 
known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested
or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable 
i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill
was charles   language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary 
i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think
there was anything the matter with me  i am sure anne if you would
you might persuade him that i really am very ill  a great deal worse
than i ever own

mary   declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house
though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours
and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash
and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing
mrs charles had a little of your method with those children 
they are quite different creatures with you  but to be sure
in general they are so spoilt  it is a pity you cannot put your sister
in the way of managing them  they are as fine healthy children
as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality
but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated   
bless me how troublesome they are sometimes  i assure you miss anne
it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as
i otherwise should  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased
with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad
to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment don   do this and don   do that  or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them

she had this communication moreover from mary  mrs musgrove thinks
all her servants so steady that it would be high treason
to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration
that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being
in their business are gadding about the village all day long 
i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery
without seeing something of them  if jemima were not the trustiest
steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her
for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them 
and on mrs musgrove   side it was i make a rule of never interfering
in any of my daughter in law   concerns for i know it would not do
but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things
to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles   nursery maid 
i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from
my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine dressing lady
that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near 
mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint
that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss
you need not be afraid of mentioning it

again it was mary   complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt
not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined
at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason
why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place 
and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them
after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said
i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are
about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent
you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that
it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious
especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take
place of mamma  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma
but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it 
it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world
but i know it is taken notice of by many persons

how was anne to set all these matters to rights  she could do little more
than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each
to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary
between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest
which were meant for her sister   benefit

in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well 
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject
by being removed three miles from kellynch mary   ailments lessened
by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse
with the other family since there was neither superior affection
confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it
was rather an advantage  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible
for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder
but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight
of mr and mrs musgrove   respectable forms in the usual places
or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters

she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves
but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents
to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was
little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others
as she was well aware  she knew that when she played she was
giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age
of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother know the happiness
of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world
and mr and mrs musgrove   fond partiality for their own daughters
performance and total indifference to any other person  
gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification
for her own

the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited
by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers
more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family 
there were more completely popular

the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally
in an unpremeditated little ball  there was a family of cousins
within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances
who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come
at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne
very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post
played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which
always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove
more than anything else and often drew this compliment  
well done miss anne very well done indeed  lord bless me
how those little fingers of yours fly about

so passed the first three weeks  michaelmas came and now anne   heart
must be in kellynch again  a beloved home made over to others
all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects
beginning to own other eyes and other limbs  she could not
think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this
sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion
to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this
the day the crofts were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did not
think of it before  how low it makes me

the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were
to be visited  mary deplored the necessity for herself 
nobody knew how much she should suffer  she should put it off
as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles
into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated
comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back 
anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going 
she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within
when the visit was returned  they came  the master of the house
was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced
that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary
and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice
of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness
and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice
or in the turn of sentiment and expression

mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness
uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face
though her reddened and weather beaten complexion the consequence
of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to
have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty 
her manners were open easy and decided like one who had
no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any
approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration
towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her 
especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute
in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest
symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft   side to give a bias
of any sort  she was quite easy on that head and consequently
full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by
mrs croft   suddenly saying  

it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had
the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country

anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion
she certainly had not

perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft

she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel
when mrs croft   next words explained it to be mr wentworth
of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do
for either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was
that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward
and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness
applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour  
present state with proper interest

the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving
she heard the admiral say to mary  

we are expecting a brother of mrs croft   here soon i dare say
you know him by name

he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys
clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away
in his coat pockets    to have another moment for finishing
or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself
as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainty
as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject
at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling

the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day
at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits
to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for
when the youngest miss musgrove walked in  that she was coming
to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves
was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted
when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage

and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are
out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much
of poor richard  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp
for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte  i will tell you
why she is out of spirits  when the crofts called this morning
they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say
that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england
or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly
and most unluckily it came into mamma   head when they were gone
that wentworth or something very like it was the name of
poor richard   captain at one time i do not know when or where
but a great while before he died poor fellow  and upon looking over
his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure
that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it
and of poor richard  so we must be as merry as we can that she may not
be dwelling upon such gloomy things

the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were
that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome
hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached
his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid
and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for
at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved
seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence
of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before

he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him
by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed
unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything
to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name
living or dead

he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals
to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen
as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board
captain frederick wentworth   frigate the laconia and from the laconia
he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters
which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole
of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters
all the rest had been mere applications for money

in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet
so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters
so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships
that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove
should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection
of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those
extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur 

she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed
and the re perusal of these letters after so long an interval
her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten
had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into
greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death 
mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when
they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first
of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards
of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them

to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name
so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might
that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth
whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back
from clifton  a very fine young man  but they could not say whether
it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne   nerves 
she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself 
since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself
to be insensible on such points  and not only did it appear that
he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude
for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect
for his character stamped as it was by poor dick   having been
six months under his care and mentioning him in strong
though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing felow
only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on
introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as
they could hear of his arrival

the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening



chapter 7


a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch
and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise
and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross
by the end of another week  it had been a great disappointment
to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed
so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth
under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest
and best in his cellars  but a week must pass only a week
in anne   reckoning and then she supposed they must meet
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week

captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove   civility
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour 
she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house
where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him
when they were stopped by the eldest boy   being at that moment
brought home in consequence of a bad fall  the child   situation
put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape
with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety
which they afterwards felt on his account

his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury
received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas 
it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once
the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed
the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control
the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend
and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it
proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession
rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants

her brother   return was the first comfort he could take best care
of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were
the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where
but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson
felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best
and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind
and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts
were able so far to digress from their nephew   state as to give
the information of captain wentworth   visit staying five minutes behind
their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted
they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable
they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance
who had been at all a favourite before  how glad they had been
to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said
it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised
in reply to papa and mamma   farther pressing invitations to come
and dine with them on the morrow  actually on the morrow
and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt
all the motive of their attention just as he ought  and in short
he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace
that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him
and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently
more full of captain wentworth than of little charles

the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came
with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries
and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir
could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now
no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think
that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy
to give him the meeting  oh no as to leaving the little boy
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape
could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs

charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination
the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced
to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed
charles i cannot bear to have you go away  only think if anything
should happen

the child had a good night and was going on well the next day 
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been
done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm
and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity
for longer confinement  the child was to be kept in bed and amused
as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do 
this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him
who could be of no use at home to shut himself up  his father
very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being
no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his
making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting
of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house

nothing can be going on better than the child said he
so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me
quite right  your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all 
you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use 
anne will send for me if anything is the matter

husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain 
mary knew from charles   manner of speaking that he was
quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him 
she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room
but as soon as there was only anne to hear  

so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this
poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening 
i knew how it would be  this is always my luck  if there is
anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it
and charles is as bad as any of them  very unfeeling  i must say
it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy 
talks of his being going on so well  how does he know that he is
going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence 
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling  so here he is to
go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother
i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit
than anybody else to be about the child  my being the mother
is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  i am not at all
equal to it  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday

but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm  
of the shock  you will not be hysterical again  i dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us  i perfectly understand mr robinson   directions
and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband 
nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province 
a sick child is always the mother   property  her own feelings
generally make it so

i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know
that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles
for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill
and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet
he was sure to begin kicking about  i have not nerves
for the sort of thing

but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending
the whole evening away from the poor boy

yes you see his papa can and why should not i  jemima is so careful
and she could send us word every hour how he was  i really think
charles might as well have told his father we would all come 
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is 
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day

well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself
suppose you were to go as well as your husband  leave little charles
to my care  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain
with him

are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening  dear me
that   a very good thought very good indeed  to be sure
i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home  am i
and it only harasses me  you who have not a mother   feelings
are a great deal the properest person  you can make little charles
do anything he always minds you at a word  it will be a great deal better
than leaving him only with jemima  oh i shall certainly go
i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me
excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know
you do not mind being left alone  an excellent thought of yours
indeed anne  i will go and tell charles and get ready directly 
you can send for us you know at a moment   notice if anything
is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease
about my dear child

the next moment she was tapping at her husband   dressing room door
and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for
the whole conversation which began with mary   saying
in a tone of great exultation  

i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home
than you are  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child
i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like 
anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him 
it is anne   own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be
a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday

this is very kind of anne was her husband   answer and i should be
very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself to nurse our sick child

anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity
of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction
was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being
left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening
when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her
to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable
and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them
set off together in high spirits  they were gone she hoped
to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem
as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort
as were perhaps ever likely to be hers  she knew herself to be
of the first utility to the child and what was it to her
if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself
agreeable to others

she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances 
he must be either indifferent or unwilling  had he wished
ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time
he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place
she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him
the independence which alone had been wanting

her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance
and their visit in general  there had been music singing
talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners
in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all
to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning
to shoot with charles  he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage
though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed
to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being
in mrs charles musgrove   way on account of the child and therefore
somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles   being to meet him
to breakfast at his father  

anne understood it  he wished to avoid seeing her  he had inquired
after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance
seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps
by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet

the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those
of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great
that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when
charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was
come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth
his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth
proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient
and though charles had answered for the child   being in no such state
as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied
without his running on to give notice

mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him
while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was
the most consoling that it would soon be over  and it was soon over 
in two minutes after charles   preparation the others appeared
they were in the drawing room  her eye half met captain wentworth  
a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary
said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves
enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons
and voices but a few minutes ended it  charles shewed himself
at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone
the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk
to the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared
and anne might finish her breakfast as she could 

it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again
in nervous gratitude  the worst is over

mary talked but she could not attend  she had seen him 
they had met  they had been once more in the same room

soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less 
eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up 
how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval
had banished into distance and indistinctness  what might not
eight years do  events of every description changes alienations
removals  all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past  
how natural how certain too  it included nearly a third part
of her own life

alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing

now how were his sentiments to be read  was this like
wishing to avoid her  and the next moment she was hating herself
for the folly which asked the question

on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom
might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense
for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit
at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary   

captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was
so attentive to me  henrietta asked him what he thought of you
when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not
have known you again

mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister   in a common way
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound

altered beyond his knowledge  anne fully submitted in silent
deep mortification  doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge
for he was not altered or not for the worse  she had already
acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently
let him think of her as he would  no  the years which had destroyed
her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly
open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages 
she had seen the same frederick wentworth

so altered that he should not have known her again  these were words
which could not but dwell with her  yet she soon began to rejoice
that she had heard them  they were of sobering tendency
they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must
make her happier

frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them
but without an idea that they would be carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal
had spoken as he felt  he had not forgiven anne elliot 
she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse
she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided
confident temper could not endure  she had given him up to oblige others 
it had been the effect of over persuasion  it had been
weakness and timidity

he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since
whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation
of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  her power with him
was gone for ever

it was now his object to marry  he was rich and being turned on shore
fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted
actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed
which a clear head and a quick taste could allow  he had a heart
for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart
in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way
excepting anne elliot  this was his only secret exception
when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions  

yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match 
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking 
a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy
and i am a lost man  should not this be enough for a sailor
who has had no society among women to make him nice

he said it she knew to be contradicted  his bright proud eye
spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was
not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described
the woman he should wish to meet with  a strong mind
with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description 

that is the woman i want said he  something a little inferior
i shall of course put up with but it must not be much  if i am a fool
i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject
more than most men



chapter 8


from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly
in the same circle  they were soon dining in company together
at mr musgrove   for the little boy   state could no longer
supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was
but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings

whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof
former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each
they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth  his profession qualified him
his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six
that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred
in the course of the first evening they spent together 
and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason
to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke
anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind
that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself 
there must be the same immediate association of thought
though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain

they had no conversation together no intercourse but what
the commonest civility required  once so much to each other 
now nothing  there had been a time when of all the large party
now filling the drawing room at uppercross they would have found it
most difficult to cease to speak to one another  with the exception
perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached
and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among
the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open
no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved 
now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could
never become acquainted  it was a perpetual estrangement

when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind 
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party
and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves
who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner
of living on board daily regulations food hours    and their surprise
at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement
which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule
which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant
and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board
without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were
or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use

from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper
of mrs musgrove   who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying  

ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son
i dare say he would have been just such another by this time

anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove
relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others

when she could let her attention take its natural course again
she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list
their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross
and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view
of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded

your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp

you will not find her there  quite worn out and broken up 
i was the last man who commanded her  hardly fit for service then 
reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off
to the west indies

the girls looked all amazement

the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then
with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed 
but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands
that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible
for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed

phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk 
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloop
you would not see her equal  lucky fellow to get her  he knows there
must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her
at the same time  lucky fellow to get anything so soon
with no more interest than his

i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth
seriously  i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire 
it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea
a very great object i wanted to be doing something

to be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashore
for half a year together  if a man had not a wife he soon wants
to be afloat again

but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been
when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you

i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling 
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen
lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember
and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself 
ah she was a dear old asp to me  she did all that i wanted 
i knew she would  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together
or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days
of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after
taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck
in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate
i wanted  i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck 
we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on
which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for
poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation
not having much improved our condition  four and twenty hours later
and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost
in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne   shudderings
were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open
as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror

and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice
as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there
he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her
do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother 
i always forgot

it was at gibraltar mother i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltar
with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth

oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid
of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure
to hear him talked of by such a good friend

charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case
only nodded in reply and walked away

the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth
could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume
into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud
the little statement of her name and rate and present
non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been
one of the best friends man ever had

ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia  how fast i
made money in her  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise
together off the western islands  poor harville sister 
you know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  he had a wife 
excellent fellow  i shall never forget his happiness  he felt it all
so much for her sake  i wished for him again the next summer
when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean

and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us
when you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forget
what you did

her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth
hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all
near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more

my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking
of poor richard

poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady
and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care 
ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you 
i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you

there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth   face at this speech
a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth
which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove   kind wishes
as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him
but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected
by any who understood him less than herself in another moment
he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards
coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting
took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her
in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy
and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all
that was real and unabsurd in the parent   feelings

they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had
most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove 
it was no insignificant barrier indeed  mrs musgrove was of
a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature
to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment
and while the agitations of anne   slender form and pensive face
may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth
should be allowed some credit for the self command with which
he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son
whom alive nobody had cared for

personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction
as the most graceful set of limbs in the world  but fair or not fair
there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain  
which taste cannot tolerate  which ridicule will seize

the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife
now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation
of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts
began with  

if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick
you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson
and her daughters

should i  i am glad i was not a week later then

the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  he defended himself
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies
on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit
which a few hours might comprehend

but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry
towards them  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is
with all one   efforts and all one   sacrifices to make
the accommodations on board such as women ought to have 
there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women
to every personal comfort high and this is what i do  i hate to hear
of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command
shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it

this brought his sister upon him

oh frederick  but i cannot believe it of you   all idle refinement
  women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england 
i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know
nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war  i declare
i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall
with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of
the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether

nothing to the purpose replied her brother  you were living
with your husband and were the only woman on board

but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin
and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was this
superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then

all merged in my friendship sophia  i would assist any
brother officer   wife that i could and i would bring anything
of harville   from the world   end if he wanted it  but do not imagine
that i did not feel it an evil in itself

depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable

i might not like them the better for that perhaps  such a number
of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board

my dear frederick you are talking quite idly  pray what would
become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to
one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings

my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville
and all her family to plymouth

but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman
and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures 
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days

ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife
he will sing a different tune  when he is married if we have
the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i
and a great many others have done  we shall have him very thankful
to anybody that will bring him his wife

ay that we shall

now i have done cried captain wentworth  when once married
people begin to attack me with  oh you will think very differently
when you are married  i can only say no i shall not and then
they say again yes you will and there is an end of it

he got up and moved away

what a great traveller you must have been ma am said mrs musgrove
to mrs croft

pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage
though many women have done more  i have crossed the atlantic
four times and have been once to the east indies and back again
and only once besides being in different places about home 
cork and lisbon and gibraltar  but i never went beyond the streights
and never was in the west indies  we do not call bermuda or bahama
you know the west indies

mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself
of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life

and i do assure you ma am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed
the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates 
when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them
and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent
on board a ship  while we were together you know there was nothing
to be feared  thank god  i have always been blessed with
excellent health and no climate disagrees with me  a little disordered
always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew
what sickness was afterwards  the only time i ever really suffered
in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell
or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal
when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas 
i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself
or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together
nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience

aye to be sure  yes indeed oh yes  i am quite of your opinion
mrs croft was mrs musgrove   hearty answer  there is nothing so bad
as a separation  i am quite of your opinion  i know what it is
for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when
they are over and he is safe back again

the evening ended with dancing  on its being proposed
anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes
fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad
to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved

it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits
than captain wentworth  she felt that he had every thing to elevate
him which general attention and deference and especially the attention
of all the young women could do  the miss hayters the females
of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted
to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa
they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but
the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves
could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals 
if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration
who could wonder

these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers
were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together
equally without error and without consciousness  once she felt
that he was looking at herself  observing her altered features
perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once
charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was
sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing 
she had rather play  she is never tired of playing  once too
he spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over
and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished
to give the miss musgroves an idea of  unintentionally she returned
to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising
said with studied politeness  

i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately
drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced
to sit down again

anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything



chapter 9


captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay
as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of
the admiral   fraternal kindness as of his wife    he had intended
on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire
and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions
of uppercross induced him to put this off  there was so much
of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching
in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable
that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all
the charms and perfections of edward   wife upon credit a little longer

it was soon uppercross with him almost every day  the musgroves
could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly
in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral
and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves
in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig
lately added to their establishment

hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth
among the musgroves and their dependencies  it was unvarying
warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more
than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them
to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth
very much in the way

charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable
pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been
a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth  
introduction  he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood
where residence was not required lived at his father   house
only two miles from uppercross  a short absence from home
had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners
and of seeing captain wentworth

mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters  they had each had money
but their marriages had made a material difference in
their degree of consequence  mr hayter had some property of his own
but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove   and while
the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country
the young hayters would from their parents inferior retired
and unpolished way of living and their own defective education
have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion
with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen
to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior
in cultivation and manners to all the rest

the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride
on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness
of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased
to improve their cousins  charles   attentions to henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation 
it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him  
and henrietta did seem to like him

henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten

which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was
as yet quite doubtful as far as anne   observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits
and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character
were most likely to attract him

mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from
an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters
and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything
to take its chance  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude
or remark about them in the mansion house but it was different
at the cottage  the young couple there were more disposed
to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above
four or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter
had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions
of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing
that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful

charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what
he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that
he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance
of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth
was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy 
oh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters

upon my word it would replied mary  dear me  if he should
rise to any very great honours  if he should ever be made a baronet
lady wentworth sounds very well  that would be a noble thing
indeed for henrietta  she would take place of me then and henrietta
would not dislike that  sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much
of your new creations

it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred
on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished
to see put an end to  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters
and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection
between the families renewed  very sad for herself and her children

you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta
and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made
she has no right to throw herself away  i do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections
to those who have not been used to them  and pray who is charles hayter 
nothing but a country curate  a most improper match for miss musgrove
of uppercross

her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having
a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son
and he saw things as an eldest son himself

now you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer 
it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has
a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from
the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember
that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very
pretty property  the estate at winthrop is not less than
two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton
which is some of the best land in the country  i grant you
that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta
and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible
but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop
comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it
and live in a very different sort of way and with that property
he will never be a contemptible man  good freehold property  no no
henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him
and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied

charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as
he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta
marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse
for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth
may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt
that he has  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as to
captain wentworth   liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense
to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive  i wish you had been with us yesterday
for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you
would have thought as i did unless you had been determined
to give it against me

a dinner at mr musgrove   had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home
under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return
of indisposition in little charles  she had thought only of avoiding
captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire
was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening

as to captain wentworth   views she deemed it of more consequence
that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering
the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour
than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate
good humoured wife  with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy
which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well meaning
young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings
it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature
of her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon

charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him
in his cousin   behaviour  she had too old a regard for him
to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish
every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away
from uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming
when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as
the probable cause  he had been absent only two sundays
and when they parted had left her interested even to the height
of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy
and obtaining that of uppercross instead  it had then seemed the object
nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than
forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office
but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed
on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good
as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going
six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy
of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley  
being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through
without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa
but had been almost everything to henrietta  when he came back alas
the zeal of the business was gone by  louisa could not listen at all
to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley 
she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta
had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten
all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation

well i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have it
i always thought you sure  it did not appear to me that  in short
you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise 
is he coming louisa

one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves
at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into
the drawing room at the cottage where were only herself and the little
invalid charles who was lying on the sofa

the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot
deprived his manners of their usual composure  he started
and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here 
mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked
to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave

they are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments
i dare say had been anne   reply in all the confusion that was natural
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him
she would have been out of the room the next moment and released
captain wentworth as well as herself

he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying
i hope the little boy is better was silent

she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there
to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes
when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person
crossing the little vestibule  she hoped on turning her head
to see the master of the house but it proved to be one
much less calculated for making matters easy  charles hayter
probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth
than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne

she only attempted to say how do you do  will you not sit down 
the others will be here presently

captain wentworth however came from his window apparently
not ill disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end
to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up
the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window

another minute brought another addition  the younger boy
a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door
opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance
among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on
and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away

there being nothing to eat he could only have some play
and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother
he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that
busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off 
she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had
the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly

walter said she get down this moment  you are extremely troublesome 
i am very angry with you

walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid 
do not you hear your aunt speak  come to me walter come to
cousin charles

but not a bit did walter stir

in another moment however she found herself in the state of
being released from him some one was taking him from her
though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands
were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away
before she knew that captain wentworth had done it

her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him  she could only hang over little charles
with most disordered feelings  his kindness in stepping forward
to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed
the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon
forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child
that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought
to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants
produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation
as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary
and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares
and leave the room  she could not stay  it might have been
an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four  
they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it 
it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards
captain wentworth  she had a strong impression of his having said
in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth   interference
you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do
what he ought to have done himself  but neither charles hayter   feelings
nor anybody   feelings could interest her till she had a little better
arranged her own  she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed
of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was
and it required a long application of solitude and reflection
to recover her



chapter 10


other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur 
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife
for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite
she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory
and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him yet there it was not love 
it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must
end in love with some  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted
and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about
and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to 
she did not attribute guile to any  it was the highest satisfaction
to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware
of the pain he was occasioning  there was no triumph no pitiful triumph
in his manner  he had probably never heard and never thought of
any claims of charles hayter  he was only wrong in accepting
the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once

after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field 
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross
a most decided change  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner
and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books
before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right
and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death 
it was mary   hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence
of seeing him to morrow  anne could only feel that charles hayter
was wise

one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth
being gone a shooting together as the sisters in the cottage
were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window
by the sisters from the mansion house

it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came
through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say
that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded
mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied
with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk
anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely
what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity
which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being
to be communicated and everything being to be done together
however undesired and inconvenient  she tried to dissuade mary from going
but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept
the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise
as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening
the interference in any plan of their own

i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk
said mary as she went up stairs  everybody is always supposing
that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased
if we had refused to join them  when people come in this manner
on purpose to ask us how can one say no

just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  they had taken out
a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready
for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  could anne
have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but
from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was
too late to retract and the whole six set forward together
in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently
considered the walk as under their guidance

anne   object was not to be in the way of anybody and where
the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary
to keep with her brother and sister  her pleasure in the walk
must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of
the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges
and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical
descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and
inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness
that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read
some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings
and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach
of captain wentworth   conversation with either of the miss musgroves
she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable 
it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing
might fall into  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech
of louisa   which struck her  after one of the many praises of the day
which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added   

what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister  they meant to take
a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from
some of these hills  they talked of coming into this side of the country 
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day  oh it does happen
very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it
she would as lieve be tossed out as not

ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were
really so i should do just the same in her place  if i loved a man
as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever
separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely
by anybody else

it was spoken with enthusiasm

had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you 
and there was silence between them for a little while

anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  the sweet scenes
of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining
happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together
blessed her memory  she roused herself to say as they struck by order
into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop 
but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her

winthrop however or its environs  for young men are sometimes
to be met with strolling about near home  was their destination
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures
where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer
counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning
to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill
which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view
of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side

winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them
an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm yard

mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop  i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired

henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles
walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready
to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no
cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be
arguing the matter warmly

charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution
of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently
though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength
and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter
of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered
oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm
than any sitting down could do her good and in short
her look and manner declared that go she would not

after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations
it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he
and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt
and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top
of the hill  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan
and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking
to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her
and saying to captain wentworth  

it is very unpleasant having such connexions  but i assure you
i have never been in the house above twice in my life

she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile
followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne
perfectly knew the meaning of

the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot 
louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself
on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others
all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away
to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge row
and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound
mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat
was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could
prevent her from going to look for a better also  she turned through
the same gate but could not see them  anne found a nice seat
for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge row in which
she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other 
mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa
had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on
till she overtook her

anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard
captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge row behind her as if
making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the
centre  they were speaking as they drew near  louisa   voice was
the first distinguished  she seemed to be in the middle of some
eager speech  what anne first heard was  

and so i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense  what would i be turned back from
doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right
by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say 
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded  when i have
made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely
to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near
giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance

she would have turned back then but for you

she would indeed  i am almost ashamed to say it

happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  after the hints
you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations
the last time i was in company with him  i need not affect
to have no comprehension of what is going on  i see that more than
a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question
and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence
when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and
strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist
idle interference in such a trifle as this  your sister is
an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness
i see  if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much
of your own spirit into her as you can  but this no doubt
you have been always doing  it is the worst evil of too yielding
and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody
may sway it  let those who would be happy be firm  here is a nut
said he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify 
a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength
has outlived all the storms of autumn  not a puncture not
a weak spot anywhere  this nut he continued with playful solemnity
while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot
is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be
supposed capable of  then returning to his former earnest tone  
my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm 
if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life
she will cherish all her present powers of mind

he had done and was unanswered  it would have surprised anne if louisa
could have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest
spoken with such serious warmth  she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her
and they were moving on  before they were beyond her hearing
however louisa spoke again 

mary is good natured enough in many respects said she
but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense
and pride   the elliot pride  she has a great deal too much
of the elliot pride  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne

after a moment   pause captain wentworth said  

do you mean that she refused him

oh yes certainly

when did that happen

i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time
but i believe about a year before he married mary  i wish she had
accepted him  we should all have liked her a great deal better
and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend
lady russell   doing that she did not  they think charles
might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell
and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him

the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her fixed  she had much to recover from
before she could move  the listener   proverbial fate was
not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard
a great deal of very painful import  she saw how her own character
was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree
of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her
extreme agitation

as soon as she could she went after mary and having found
and walked back with her to their former station by the stile
felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards
collected and once more in motion together  her spirits wanted
the solitude and silence which only numbers could give

charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured
charles hayter with them  the minutiae of the business anne
could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem
admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing
on the gentleman   side and a relenting on the lady   and that they
were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased  
charles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other
almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross

everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth
nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary
or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much
as the other two  in a long strip of meadow land where there was
ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties
and to that party of the three which boasted least animation
and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged  she joined charles
and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles   other arm
but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper
with his wife  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him
and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was
his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads
of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began
to complain of it and lament her being ill used according to custom
in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other
he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had
a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all

this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it
was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit
the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been
some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral croft   gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in
they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired
it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross 
the invitation was general and generally declined  the miss musgroves
were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked
before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride
could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise

the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an
opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again
when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his sister  the something might be guessed by its effects

miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft 
do let us have the pleasure of taking you home  here is excellent room
for three i assure you  if we were all like you i believe we might
sit four  you must indeed you must

anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline
she was not allowed to proceed  the admiral   kind urgency
came in support of his wife   they would not be refused
they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space
to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word
turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage

yes he had done it  she was in the carriage and felt that he had
placed her there that his will and his hands had done it
that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution
to give her rest  she was very much affected by the view of
his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent 
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him  he could not forgive her but he could not
be unfeeling  though condemning her for the past and considering it
with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her
and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer
without the desire of giving her relief  it was a remainder
of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged
friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart
which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded
of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed

her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions
were at first unconsciously given  they had travelled half their way
along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of frederick

he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy
said the admiral but there is no saying which  he has been
running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind 
ay this comes of the peace  if it were war now he would have
settled it long ago  we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make
long courtships in time of war  how many days was it my dear
between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together
in our lodgings at north yarmouth

we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly
for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding
she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together 
i had known you by character however long before

well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we
to wait for besides  i do not like having such things so long in hand 
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home
one of these young ladies to kellynch  then there would always
be company for them  and very nice young ladies they both are
i hardly know one from the other

very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft
in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that
her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy
of her brother and a very respectable family  one could not be
connected with better people  my dear admiral that post
we shall certainly take that post

but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out
her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung cart
and anne with some amusement at their style of driving
which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance
of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage 



chapter 11


the time now approached for lady russell   return  the day was even fixed
and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled
was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning
to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it

it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth
within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church
and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time
at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather
as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole
she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer
almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society
in leaving poor mary for lady russell

she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing
captain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessed
former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her
but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and
captain wentworth never meeting anywhere  they did not like each other
and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell
to see them together she might think that he had too much self possession
and she too little

these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating
her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed
quite long enough  her usefulness to little charles would always
give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there
but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for

the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way
which she had not at all imagined  captain wentworth after being unseen
and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away

a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last
had brought intelligence of captain harville   being settled
with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore
quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  captain harville
had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received
two years before and captain wentworth   anxiety to see him
had determined him to go immediately to lyme  he had been there
for four and twenty hours  his acquittal was complete
his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend
and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to
by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves
and a project for going thither was the consequence

the young people were all wild to see lyme  captain wentworth talked
of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross
though november the weather was by no means bad and in short
louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed
the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked
being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way
bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off
till summer and to lyme they were to go  charles mary anne henrietta
louisa and captain wentworth

the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night
but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent
and when it came to be rationally considered a day in
the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place
after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required
for going and returning  they were consequently to stay the night there
and not to be expected back till the next day   dinner  this was felt
to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house
at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually
it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove   coach
containing the four ladies and charles   curricle in which
he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme
and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself
that it was very evident they would not have more than time
for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone

after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns
the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea  they were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which lyme as a public place might offer  the rooms
were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family
but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire
in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town
the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb
skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season
is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself
its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful
line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what
the stranger   eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be
who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme
to make him wish to know it better  the scenes in its neighbourhood
charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country
and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs
where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot
for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation
the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all
pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where
the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth
declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state
where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far famed
isle of wight  these places must be visited and visited again
to make the worth of lyme understood

the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted
and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves
on the sea shore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze
on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all
proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself
and on captain wentworth   account  for in a small house
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled 
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on
and he was to join them on the cobb

they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa
seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long
when they saw him coming after them with three companions
all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville
and a captain benwick who was staying with them

captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him
on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as
an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly
which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener
had been followed by a little history of his private life
which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville   sister and was now
mourning her loss  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune
and promotion  fortune came his prize money as lieutenant being great
promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  captain wentworth
believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman
than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply
afflicted under the dreadful change  he considered his disposition
as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings
with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading
and sedentary pursuits  to finish the interest of the story
the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible
augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance
and captain benwick was now living with them entirely  captain harville
had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health
and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive
and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement
of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick  
state of mind  the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick
was very great

and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward
to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart
than i have  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact
younger as a man  he will rally again and be happy with another

they all met and were introduced  captain harville was a tall
dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame
and from strong features and want of health looking much older
than captain wentworth  captain benwick looked and was
the youngest of the three and compared with either of them
a little man  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air
just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation

captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners
was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however
to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant
than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own
because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable
than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly
accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth
should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it
as a thing of course that they should dine with them

there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this
and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon
so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners
of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be
benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers 
these would have been all my friends was her thought
and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness

on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many  anne had
a moment   astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost
in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all
the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville
to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies
of lodging house furniture and defend the windows and doors
against the winter storms to be expected  the varieties in
the fitting up of the rooms where the common necessaries
provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood
excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable
from all the distant countries captain harville had visited
were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession
the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits
the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented
made it to her a something more or less than gratification

captain harville was no reader but he had contrived
excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves
for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of
captain benwick  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with
constant employment within  he drew he varnished he carpentered
he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles
and pins with improvements and if everything else was done
sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room

anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they
quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking
burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character
of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness
their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having
more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be
respected and loved

they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme
answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being
so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme
and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies
from the heads of the inn

anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened
to being in captain wentworth   company than she had at first imagined
could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now
and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it
they never got beyond was become a mere nothing

the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow
but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening
and he came bringing his friend also which was more than
had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick
had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of
so many strangers  he ventured among them again however
though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth
of the party in general

while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room
and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne   lot to be placed
rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse
of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of
her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect
and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading
though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having
given him at least an evening   indulgence in the discussion of subjects
which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope
of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and
benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out
of their conversation  for though shy he did not seem reserved
it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their
usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of
the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion
as to the first rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion
or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour
and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced
he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs
of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony
of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines
which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness
and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood
that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry
and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be
seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly
were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly

his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion
to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself
the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend
a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested
to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists
such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters
of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment
as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts
and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances

captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for
the interest implied and though with a shake of the head
and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books
on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended
and promised to procure and read them

when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea
of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing
on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists
and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examination



chapter 12


anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party
the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast 
they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide
which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur
which so flat a shore admitted  they praised the morning
gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling
breeze  and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with  

oh yes  i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions
the sea air always does good  there can be no doubt of its having been
of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness
last spring twelve month  he declares himself that coming to lyme
for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took
and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again 
now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live
entirely by the sea  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely
and fix at lyme  do not you anne  do not you agree with me
that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley 
she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would
make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad
to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand
in case of his having another seizure  indeed i think it quite melancholy
to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been
doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place
like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out
from all the world  i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought  and as to procuring a dispensation
there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous
i must say  do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience
when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties
which may be just as well performed by another person  and at lyme too
only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear
if people thought there was anything to complain of

anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech
and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into
the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good
of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business
felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very
desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man
as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at
the advantage of such resident curate   being married

i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion
i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate
with dr shirley  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of
the greatest influence with everybody  i always look upon her as able
to persuade a person to anything  i am afraid of her as i have
told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour
at uppercross

anne was amused by henrietta   manner of being grateful
and amused also that the course of events and the new interests
of henrietta   views should have placed her friend at all in favour
with any of the musgrove family she had only time however
for a general answer and a wish that such another woman
were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased
on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something
to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town 
they were all at her disposal

when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman
at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back
and stopped to give them way  they ascended and passed him
and as they passed anne   face caught his eye and he looked at her
with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of 
she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features
having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind
which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye
which it had also produced  it was evident that the gentleman
completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which
shewed his noticing of it  he gave her a momentary glance
a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you
and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again

after attending louisa through her business and loitering about
a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards
quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against
the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment 
she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves
and determined that a well looking groom who was strolling about
near the two inns as they came back should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves
and this second meeting short as it was also proved again
by the gentleman   looks that he thought hers very lovely
and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was
a man of exceedingly good manners  he seemed about thirty
and though not handsome had an agreeable person  anne felt that
she should like to know who he was

they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage
almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party
to the window  it was a gentleman   carriage a curricle
but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door
somebody must be going away  it was driven by a servant in mourning

the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might
compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne   curiosity
and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner
of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows
and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off

ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne
it is the very man we passed

the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him
as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table 
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards

pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away

yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night
from sidmouth  dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were
at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath
and london

elliot  many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name
before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter

bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot
it must indeed  charles anne must not it  in mourning you see
just as our mr elliot must be  how very extraordinary 
in the very same inn with us  anne must not it be our mr elliot
my father   next heir  pray sir turning to the waiter
did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged
to the kellynch family

no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said
his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day

there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said 
heir to sir walter elliot  i was sure that would come out
if it was so  depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants
take care to publish wherever he goes  but anne only conceive
how extraordinary  i wish i had looked at him more  i wish we had
been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us 
what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other 
do you think he had the elliot countenance  i hardly looked at him
i was looking at the horses but i think he had something
of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me 
oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms
so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them
and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning
one should have known him by the livery

putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together
said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement
of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin

when she could command mary   attention anne quietly tried
to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years
been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction
at all desirable

at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself
to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch
was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him
the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having
passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt
quite ill used by anne   having actually run against him in the passage
and received his very polite excuses while she had never been
near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain
a perfect secret

of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot
the next time you write to bath  i think my father certainly
ought to hear of it do mention all about him

anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance
which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated
but as what ought to be suppressed  the offence which had been given
her father many years back she knew elizabeth   particular share in it
she suspected and that mr elliot   idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt  mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil
of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth
fell on anne

breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain
and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed
to take their last walk about lyme  they ought to be setting off
for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together
and out of doors as long as they could

anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all
fairly in the street  their conversation the preceding evening
did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together
some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron
and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers
to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something
occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of
captain benwick she had captain harville by her side

miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much  i wish he could have
such company oftener  it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is
but what can we do  we cannot part

no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible
but in time perhaps  we know what time does in every case of affliction
and you must remember captain harville that your friend
may yet be called a young mourner  only last summer i understand

ay true enough with a deep sigh only june

and not known to him perhaps so soon

not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape
just made into the grappler  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him
he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth 
there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i 
i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm  nobody could do it
but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth  the laconia
had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her
being sent to sea again  he stood his chance for the rest
wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return
travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off
to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that   what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us

anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed
able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject
and when he spoke again it was of something totally different

mrs harville   giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction
of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would
accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves 
by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew
near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more
all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined
that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found
would be no difference at all so with all the kind leave taking
and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which
may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville
at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick
who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make
the proper adieus to the cobb

anne found captain benwick again drawing near her  lord byron  
dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by
their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as
attention was possible  it was soon drawn perforce another way

there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant
for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower
and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight
excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth 
in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles
the sensation was delightful to her  the hardness of the pavement
for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion
he did it however  she was safely down and instantly
to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again 
he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no
he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined
i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second
she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless 
there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed
she breathed not her face was like death  the horror of the moment
to all who stood around

captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence 
she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her
husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable
and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost
her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain
benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them

is there no one to help me were the first words which
burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if
all his own strength were gone

go to him go to him cried anne for heaven   sake go to him 
i can support her myself  leave me and go to him  rub her hands
rub her temples here are salts take them take them

captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment
disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him
and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them
and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain
while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support
exclaimed in the bitterest agony  

oh god her father and mother

a surgeon said anne

he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only  
true true a surgeon this instant was darting away
when anne eagerly suggested  

captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick 
he knows where a surgeon is to be found

every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea
and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had
resigned the poor corpse like  figure entirely to the brother   care
and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity

as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said
which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most 
captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate
brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes
from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible
or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him
for help which he could not give

anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought
which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals
to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles
to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth  both seemed to look to her
for directions

anne anne cried charles what is to be done next 
what in heaven   name is to be done next

captain wentworth   eyes were also turned towards her

had not she better be carried to the inn  yes i am sure 
carry her gently to the inn

yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively
collected and eager to be doing something  i will carry her myself 
musgrove take care of the others

by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them
to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of
a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine
as the first report  to some of the best looking of these good people
henrietta was consigned for though partially revived
she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side
and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back
with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately
and so light of heart they had passed along

they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them 
captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance
which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately
informed and directed as they passed towards the spot 
shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves
that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife
decided what was to be done  she must be taken to their house
all must go to their house and await the surgeon   arrival there 
they would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all
beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harville   direction
was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed
assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband
to all who needed them

louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again
without apparent consciousness  this had been a proof of life
however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly
incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept
by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility 
mary too was growing calmer

the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible 
they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless 
the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries
recovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully

that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say
a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most
and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent
after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered
may be conceived

the tone the look with which thank god was uttered
by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her
nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it
with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by
the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection
to calm them

louisa   limbs had escaped  there was no injury but to the head

it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done
as to their general situation  they were now able to speak to each other
and consult  that louisa must remain where she was however distressing
to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble
did not admit a doubt  her removal was impossible  the harvilles
silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude 
they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others
began to reflect  captain benwick must give up his room to them
and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled 
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more
and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid   room
or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not
finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay
though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be
the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville   care entirely 
mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery maid
who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere
was just such another  between these two she could want
no possible attendance by day or night  and all this was said
with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible

charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation
and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror 
uppercross the necessity of some one   going to uppercross
the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove
the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they
ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time 
at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose
than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth
exerting himself said  

we must be decided and without the loss of another minute 
every minute is valuable  some one must resolve on being off
for uppercross instantly  musgrove either you or i must go

charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away 
he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville
but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would 
so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same 
she however was soon persuaded to think differently  the usefulness
of her staying  she who had not been able to remain in louisa   room
or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless 
she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good
yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought
of her father and mother she gave it up she consented
she was anxious to be at home

the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly
down from louisa   room could not but hear what followed
for the parlour door was open

then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth
that you stay and that i take care of your sister home 
but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville
i think it need be only one  mrs charles musgrove will of course
wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper
so capable as anne

she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself
so spoken of  the other two warmly agreed with what he said
and she then appeared

you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he
turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness
which seemed almost restoring the past  she coloured deeply
and he recollected himself and moved away  she expressed herself
most willing ready happy to remain  it was what she had been
thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  a bed on the floor
in louisa   room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville
would but think so

one thing more and all seemed arranged  though it was rather desirable
that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses
to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense
and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed
that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn
and leave mr musgrove   carriage and horses to be sent home
the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage
of sending an account of louisa   night

captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part
and to be soon followed by the two ladies  when the plan was
made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it 
she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice
in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was
nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right
to stay in henrietta   stead  why was not she to be as useful as anne 
and to go home without charles too without her husband 
no it was too unkind  and in short she said more than her husband
could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose
when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne
was inevitable

anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous
and ill judging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off
for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick
attending to her  she gave a moment   recollection as they hurried along
to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed
earlier in the morning  there she had listened to henrietta   schemes
for dr shirley   leaving uppercross farther on she had
first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given
to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare

captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and
united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt
an increasing degree of good will towards him and a pleasure even
in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing
their acquaintance

captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting
stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street
but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister
for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment
the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to
made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her
that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa

she endeavoured to be composed and to be just  without emulating
the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have
attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard
for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust
as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend

in the mean while she was in the carriage  he had handed them both in
and placed himself between them and in this manner under these
circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however  he was devoted to henrietta
always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view
of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  in general
his voice and manner were studiously calm  to spare henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle  once only
when she had been grieving over the last ill judged ill fated
walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of
he burst forth as if wholly overcome  

don   talk of it don   talk of it he cried  oh god that i had
not given way to her at the fatal moment  had i done as i ought 
but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa

anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness
of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage
of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that
like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions
and limits  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel
that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness
as a very resolute character

they got on fast  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills
and the same objects so soon  their actual speed heightened by
some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long
as on the day before  it was growing quite dusk however
before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been
total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back
in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her
having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill
anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth 
in a low cautious voice he said   

i have been considering what we had best do  she must not
appear at first  she could not stand it  i have been thinking whether
you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in
and break it to mr and mrs musgrove  do you think this is a good plan

she did  he was satisfied and said no more  but the remembrance
of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship
and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became
a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen

when the distressing communication at uppercross was over
and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped
and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced
his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme
and when the horses were baited he was off

end of volume one



chapter 13


the remainder of anne   time at uppercross comprehending only two days
was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction
of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion
and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which
in mr and mrs musgrove   distressed state of spirits would have
been difficulties

they had an early account from lyme the next morning  louisa was
much the same  no symptoms worse than before had appeared 
charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and
more particular account  he was tolerably cheerful  a speedy cure
must not be hoped but everything was going on as well
as the nature of the case admitted  in speaking of the harvilles
he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness
especially of mrs harville   exertions as a nurse  she really left
nothing for mary to do  he and mary had been persuaded to go early
to their inn last night  mary had been hysterical again this morning 
when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick
which he hoped would do her good  he almost wished she had been
prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was
that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do

charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father
had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent 
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others
and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed
and was acted upon  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne
and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid
of the family one who having brought up all the children
and seen the very last the lingering and long petted master harry
sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery
to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could
get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being
allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa  vague wishes of
getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta
but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on
and found practicable so soon

they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all
the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain
every twenty four hours  he made it his business to go to lyme
and his account was still encouraging  the intervals of sense
and consciousness were believed to be stronger  every report agreed
in captain wentworth   appearing fixed in lyme

anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded 
what should they do without her  they were wretched comforters
for one another  and so much was said in this way that anne thought
she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination
to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once 
she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go
go to morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings
as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved 
they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with
they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children
and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted
with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her
last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations
and sending them off at an early hour though her being left
to the solitary range of the house was the consequence

she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage
she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled
and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross
its cheerful character  a few days had made a change indeed

if louisa recovered it would all be well again  more than
former happiness would be restored  there could not be a doubt
to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery 
a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by
her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy
and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love
all that was most unlike anne elliot

an hour   complete leisure for such reflections as these
on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out
the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough
to make the sound of lady russell   carriage exceedingly welcome
and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house
or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and
comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses
the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart 
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious 
it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe
but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling
some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could
never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that
such things had been

anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell   house
in september  it had not been necessary and the few occasions of
its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade
and escape from  her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes
of its mistress

there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell   joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross  but happily
either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell
fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion
had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration
of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
a second spring of youth and beauty

when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change 
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch
and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother
among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest 
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears
and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place
which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still
be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known
how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove
and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her
was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick
than her own father   house in camden place or her own sister   intimacy
with mrs clay  she was actually forced to exert herself
to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude
on topics which had by nature the first claim on her

there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse
on another subject  they must speak of the accident at lyme 
lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before
when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must
be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence
lament the result and captain wentworth   name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to
lady russell   eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her
briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer

lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy
but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt
that the man who at twenty three had seemed to understand somewhat
of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards
be charmed by a louisa musgrove

the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme
which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought
a rather improving account of louisa  at the end of that period
lady russell   politeness could repose no longer and the fainter
self threatenings of the past became in a decided tone
i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon 
anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house 
it will be some trial to us both

anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said
in observing  

i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two
your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it

she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact
so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father
so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure
of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief
that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal
she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone
who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed
into better hands than its owners  these convictions must unquestionably
have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded
that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again
and returning through the well known apartments

in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself
these rooms ought to belong only to us  oh how fallen
in their destination  how unworthily occupied  an ancient family
to be so driven away  strangers filling their place 
no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where
she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description
to heave

mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure
of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion
receiving her in that house there was particular attention

the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic
and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared
that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time
since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had
not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours
and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention
of quitting it any more  he had enquired after her she found
particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliot   not being
the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else
could have done

as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style
by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work
on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been
the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence
that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think
how long miss musgrove   recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable
she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter 
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming  

ay a very bad business indeed  a new sort of way this
for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress   head
is not it miss elliot  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster
truly

admiral croft   manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell
but they delighted anne  his goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible

now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from
a little reverie to be coming and finding us here  i had not
recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad 
but now do not stand upon ceremony  get up and go over all the rooms
in the house if you like it

another time sir i thank you not now

well whenever it suits you  you can slip in from the shrubbery
at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up
by that door  a good place is not it  but checking himself
you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept
in the butler   room  ay so it always is i believe 
one man   ways may be as good as another   but we all like our own best 
and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you
to go about the house or not

anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully

we have made very few changes either continued the admiral
after thinking a moment  very few  we told you about the laundry door
at uppercross  that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience
of its opening as it did so long  you will tell sir walter
what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement
the house ever had  indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say
that the few alterations we have made have been all very much
for the better  my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides sending away some of the large
looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father   
a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure 
but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection
i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away
from one   self  so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon
shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my
little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing
that i never go near

anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough
took up the subject again to say  

the next time you write to your good father miss elliot
pray give him my compliments and mrs croft   and say that we are
settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find
with the place  the breakfast room chimney smokes a little
i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard
which may not happen three times a winter  and take it altogether
now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge
there is not one that we like better than this  pray say so
with my compliments  he will be glad to hear it

lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other 
but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed
far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced
themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions
in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again
before lady russell would be removing to bath

so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall
or of seeing him in company with her friend  everything was safe enough
and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted
on the subject



chapter 14


though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after
mr and mrs musgrove   going than anne conceived they could have been
at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again
and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross
they drove over to the lodge  they had left louisa beginning to sit up
but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves
susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though
she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well
it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear
the removal home and her father and mother who must return
in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays
had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them

they had been all in lodgings together  mrs musgrove had
got mrs harville   children away as much as she could every possible
supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience
to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them
to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been
only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested
and hospitable

mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident
by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer 
charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when
they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid servant to wait
and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence
but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her
on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much
going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings
and the harvilles and she had got books from the library
and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been
much in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth too
and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many
more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful
had made really an agreeable fortnight

anne enquired after captain benwick mary   face was clouded directly 
charles laughed

oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is
a very odd young man  i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertook
to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part
i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night
he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had
been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had
promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word
i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage
for such a heart broken man as captain benwick

charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well
how it really was  it was all your doing turning to anne 
he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by 
he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered
that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him
and he had not courage to come  that is the fact upon my honour
mary knows it is

but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from
not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation
to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe
anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be
left to be guessed  anne   good will however was not to be lessened
by what she heard  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered
and continued her enquiries

oh he talks of you cried charles in such terms   
mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him
mention anne twice all the time i was there  i declare anne
he never talks of you at all

no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general
way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation
and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other
in one of them which he thinks   oh i cannot pretend to remember it
but it was something very fine  i overheard him telling henrietta
all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms 
now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were
in the other room  elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end
of miss elliot   charms

and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit
if he did  miss harville only died last june  such a heart
is very little worth having is it lady russell  i am sure
you will agree with me

i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling

and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am
said charles  though he had not nerves for coming away with us
and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here
he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself
you may depend on it  i told him the distance and the road
and i told him of the church   being so very well worth seeing
for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would
be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so i give you notice lady russell

any acquaintance of anne   will always be welcome to me
was lady russell   kind answer

oh as to being anne   acquaintance said mary i think he is rather
my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight

well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy
to see captain benwick

you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am 
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  he has walked with me
sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word 
he is not at all a well bred young man  i am sure you will not like him

there we differ mary said anne  i think lady russell would like him 
i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would
very soon see no deficiency in his manner

so do i anne said charles  i am sure lady russell would like him 
he is just lady russell   sort  give him a book and he will
read all day long

yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly  he will sit poring
over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one
drop   one   scissors or anything that happens  do you think
lady russell would like that

lady russell could not help laughing  upon my word said she
i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have
admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact
as i may call myself  i have really a curiosity to see the person
who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions 
i wish he may be induced to call here  and when he does mary
you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined
not to judge him beforehand

you will not like him i will answer for it

lady russell began talking of something else  mary spoke with animation
of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily

he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see 
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family
has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me

this decision checked mary   eagerness and stopped her short
in the midst of the elliot countenance

with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries
there was voluntary communication sufficient  his spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected  as louisa improved
he had improved and he was now quite a different creature
from what he had been the first week  he had not seen louisa
and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her
from an interview that he did not press for it at all and
on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week
or ten days till her head was stronger  he had talked of going
down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick
to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick
seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch

there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both
occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time 
lady russell could not hear the door bell without feeling that it might
be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence
in her father   grounds or any visit of charity in the village
without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
captain benwick came not however  he was either less disposed for it
than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him
a week   indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy
of the interest which he had been beginning to excite

the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school
bringing with them mrs harville   little children to improve the noise
of uppercross and lessen that of lyme  henrietta remained with louisa
but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters

lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once
when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter
nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast
as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in

immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles
whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children
from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  on one side
was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk
and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays
bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys
were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire
which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise
of the others  charles and mary also came in of course
during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects
to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes
talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children
on his knees generally in vain  it was a fine family piece

anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed
such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves
which louisa   illness must have so greatly shaken  but mrs musgrove
who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially
again and again for all her attentions to them concluded
a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing
with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through
nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness
at home

louisa was now recovering apace  her mother could even think of her
being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters
went to school again  the harvilles had promised to come with her
and stay at uppercross whenever she returned  captain wentworth was gone
for the present to see his brother in shropshire

i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross
in the christmas holidays

everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters
and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort
rather than their quantity  when lady russell not long afterwards
was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through
the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place
amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays
the bawling of newspapermen muffin men and milkmen and the ceaseless
clink of pattens she made no complaint  no these were noises
which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose
under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling
though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be
so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness

anne did not share these feelings  she persisted in a very determined
though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish
of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be
however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her
when she arrived  and looked back with fond regret to the bustles
of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch

elizabeth   last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest 
mr elliot was in bath  he had called in camden place had called
a second time a third had been pointedly attentive  if elizabeth
and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains
to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection
as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  this was very wonderful
if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable
curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment
she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had
no wish to see  she had a great wish to see him  if he really sought
to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven
for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree

anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance
but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not
which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath

she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove
to her own lodgings in rivers street



chapter 15


sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place
a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction

anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment
of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i
leave you again  a degree of unexpected cordiality however
in the welcome she received did her good  her father and sister
were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture
and met her with kindness  her making a fourth when they
sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage

mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles
were more a matter of course  anne had always felt that she would
pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others
was unlooked for  they were evidently in excellent spirits
and she was soon to listen to the causes  they had no inclination
to listen to her  after laying out for some compliments of being
deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay
they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be
all their own  uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little 
it was all bath

they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect  their house was undoubtedly
the best in camden place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of
and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting up
or the taste of the furniture  their acquaintance was
exceedingly sought after  everybody was wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introductions and still were
perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing

here were funds of enjoyment  could anne wonder that her father
and sister were happy  she might not wonder but she must sigh
that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see
nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder
should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town
and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open
the folding doors and walked with exultation from one drawing room
to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman
who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of
between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder

but this was not all which they had to make them happy 
they had mr elliot too  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath
in november in his way to london when the intelligence of
sir walter   being settled there had of course reached him
though only twenty four hours in the place but he had not been able
to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath
and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card
in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet
and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct
such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received
as a relation again that their former good understanding
was completely re established

they had not a fault to find in him  he had explained away
all the appearance of neglect on his own side  it had originated
in misapprehension entirely  he had never had an idea of
throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off
but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  upon the hint
of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family
and the family honours he was quite indignant  he who had ever boasted
of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection
were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day 
he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct
must refute it  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him
and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity
of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation
and heir presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject

the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of
much extenuation  this was an article not to be entered on by himself
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly
respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill looking man
sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough
buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted
to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things
relative to the marriage which made a material difference
in the discredit of it

colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted
also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated
accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attraction
not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was
moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman 
here was a great deal to soften the business  a very fine woman
with a large fortune in love with him  sir walter seemed to admit it
as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance
in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation

mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once
evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they
gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof
of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being
on intimate terms in camden place

anne listened but without quite understanding it  allowances
large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment  all that sounded extravagant
or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators  still however she had
the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared
in mr elliot   wishing after an interval of so many years
to be well received by them  in a worldly view he had nothing to gain
by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two
and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man
why should it be an object to him  she could only offer one solution
it was perhaps for elizabeth   sake  there might really have been
a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him
a different way and now that he could afford to please himself
he might mean to pay his addresses to her  elizabeth was certainly
very handsome with well bred elegant manners and her character
might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public
and when very young himself  how her temper and understanding
might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life
was another concern and rather a fearful one  most earnestly did she wish
that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth
were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so
and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent
by a glance or two between them while mr elliot   frequent visits
were talked of

anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without
being much attended to  oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot 
they did not know  it might be him perhaps  they could not listen
to her description of him  they were describing him themselves
sir walter especially  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike
appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face
his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being
very much under hung a defect which time seemed to have increased
nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered
almost every feature for the worse  mr elliot appeared to think
that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when
they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return
the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  he did not mean
to complain however  mr elliot was better to look at than most men
and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere

mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of
the whole evening  colonel wallis had been so impatient to be
introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should
and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description
as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot
spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known
in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be
an excessively pretty woman beautiful  he longed to see her 
he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces
he was continually passing in the streets  the worst of bath was
the number of its plain women  he did not mean to say that there were
no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face
would be followed by thirty or five and thirty frights and once
as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted
eighty seven women go by one after another without there being
a tolerable face among them  it had been a frosty morning
to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand
could stand the test of  but still there certainly were
a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men
they were infinitely worse  such scarecrows as the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis
who was a fine military figure though sandy haired without observing
that every woman   eye was upon him every woman   eye was sure to be
upon colonel wallis  modest sir walter  he was not allowed
to escape however  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting
that colonel wallis   companion might have as good a figure
as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy haired

how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour 
the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not
happen every day

oh no that must have been quite accidental  in general she has been
in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas

if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds
and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse

anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown
or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door
suspended everything  a knock at the door and so late 
it was ten o clock  could it be mr elliot  they knew he was to dine
in lansdown crescent  it was possible that he might stop in his way home
to ask them how they did  they could think of no one else 
mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot   knock  mrs clay was right 
with all the state which a butler and foot boy could give
mr elliot was ushered into the room

it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress 
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments
and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour
but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she
nor her friend had taken cold the day before       which was
all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part
must follow then  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter
mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter
there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and
blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features
which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement
at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware
of who she was  he looked completely astonished but not more astonished
than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity
he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated
to be received as an acquaintance already  he was quite as good looking
as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking
and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished
so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them
in excellence to only one person   manners  they were not the same
but they were perhaps equally good

he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much 
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  ten minutes
were enough to certify that  his tone his expressions
his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all
the operation of a sensible discerning mind  as soon as he could
he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions
respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance
of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time
to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that
he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme 
his regret increased as he listened  he had spent his whole
solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices
mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people
longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion
of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself 
if he had but asked who the party were  the name of musgrove would
have told him enough  well it would serve to cure him of
an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn
which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal
of its being very ungenteel to be curious

the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he
as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing
are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings
in the world  the folly of the means they often employ
is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view

but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone 
he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others
and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme

his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene
she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place 
having alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole 
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also
but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish
of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern
for what she must have suffered in witnessing it

he staid an hour with them  the elegant little clock on the mantel 
piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman
was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale
before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long

anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in
camden place could have passed so well



chapter 16


there was one point which anne on returning to her family
would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot  
being in love with elizabeth which was her father   not being
in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it
when she had been at home a few hours  on going down to breakfast
the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence
on the lady   side of meaning to leave them  she could imagine mrs clay
to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself
at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper
that must not be any reason indeed  i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time
to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be  as yet
you have seen nothing of bath  you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now  you must stay to be acquainted
with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis  to your fine mind
i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification

he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised
to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness
but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought
in her sister  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties
and promise to stay

in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be
alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin
her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  had she been
using any thing in particular  no nothing  merely gowland
he supposed  no nothing at all  ha he was surprised at that
and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are 
you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland
the constant use of gowland during the spring months  mrs clay has been
using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles

if elizabeth could but have heard this  such personal praise
might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne
that the freckles were at all lessened  but everything must
take its chance  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished
if elizabeth were also to marry  as for herself she might always
command a home with lady russell

lady russell   composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point in her intercourse in camden place  the sight of mrs clay
in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation
to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath
who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has
a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed

as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable
or more indifferent towards the others  his manners were
an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found
the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first
as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable
or estimable man  everything united in him good understanding
correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart 
he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour
without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune
without display he judged for himself in everything essential
without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits
or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet
with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value
for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of
fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess 
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  colonel wallis
said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness
to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his
thinking of a second choice  her satisfaction in mr elliot
outweighed all the plague of mrs clay

it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she
and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell
should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require
more motives than appeared in mr elliot   great desire of a reconciliation 
in lady russell   view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot
at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object
and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people
to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process
in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring
in the heyday of youth  anne presumed however still to smile about it
and at last to mention elizabeth  lady russell listened and looked
and made only this cautious reply   elizabeth very well
time will explain

it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation
felt she must submit to  she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit
of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity
of attention seemed almost impossible  mr elliot too
it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months 
a little delay on his side might be very excusable  in fact
anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that
she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations
for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed
so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery
from the awful impression of its being dissolved

however it might end he was without any question their
pleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to him
and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme
which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of
as herself  they went through the particulars of their first meeting
a great many times  he gave her to understand that he had
looked at her with some earnestness  she knew it well
and she remembered another person   look also

they did not always think alike  his value for rank and connexion
she perceived was greater than hers  it was not merely complaisance
it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly
into her father and sister   solicitudes on a subject which
she thought unworthy to excite them  the bath paper one morning
announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple
and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort
of no    camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples
in anne   opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly

anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility
and she must acknowledge herself disappointed  she had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life
and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen
a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple
and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears
all day long

sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount
but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties
of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse
by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount
when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter  
at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland  the neglect
had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot
died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch
and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend
that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted
as cousins again was the question  and it was a question which
in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot
thought unimportant  family connexions were always worth preserving
good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house
for three months in laura place and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her
spoken of as a charming woman  it was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots

sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote
a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty
to his right honourable cousin  neither lady russell nor mr elliot
could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted
in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance 
the toils of the business were over the sweets began  they visited
in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple
and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might
be most visible  and our cousins in laura place  our cousin
lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody

anne was ashamed  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been
very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation
they created but they were nothing  there was no superiority of manner
accomplishment or understanding  lady dalrymple had acquired
the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer
for everybody  miss carteret with still less to say was so plain
and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place
but for her birth

lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet
it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak
her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing
in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion
as good company as those who would collect good company around them
they had their value  anne smiled and said 

my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever
well informed people who have a great deal of conversation
that is what i call good company

you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company
that is the best  good company requires only birth education
and manners and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is
by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary
it will do very well  my cousin anne shakes her head 
she is not satisfied  she is fastidious  my dear cousin
sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious
than almost any other woman i know but will it answer 
will it make you happy  will it not be wiser to accept the society
of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages
of the connexion as far as possible  you may depend upon it
that they will move in the first set in bath this winter
and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them
will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say
in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for

yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added
i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken
to procure the acquaintance  i suppose smiling i have more pride
than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be
so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may
be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them

pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living
it might be as you say  but in bath sir walter elliot and his family
will always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance

well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place

i love your indignation said he it is very natural 
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here
with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish
to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated
would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem
a little different  in one point i am sure my dear cousin
he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room
in one point i am sure we must feel alike  we must feel that
every addition to your father   society among his equals or superiors
may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him

he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been
lately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant
and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride
she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience
admitted that his wishing to promote her father   getting
great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her



chapter 17


while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their
good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance
of a very different description

she had called on her former governess and had heard from her
of there being an old school fellow in bath who had the two strong claims
on her attention of past kindness and present suffering  miss hamilton
now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life
when it had been most valuable  anne had gone unhappy to school
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved
feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen
of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time
and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want
of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school
had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened
her misery and could never be remembered with indifference

miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards
was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all
that anne had known of her till now that their governess   account
brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form

she was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravagant
and at his death about two years before had left his affairs
dreadfully involved  she had had difficulties of every sort
to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted
with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs
had made her for the present a cripple  she had come to bath
on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths
living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself
the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society

their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit
from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore
lost no time in going  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard
or what she intended at home  it would excite no proper interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments
and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith   lodgings
in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken

the visit was paid their acquaintance re established their interest
in each other more than re kindled  the first ten minutes
had its awkwardness and its emotion  twelve years were gone
since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person
from what the other had imagined  twelve years had changed anne
from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant
little woman of seven and twenty with every beauty except bloom
and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle
and twelve years had transformed the fine looking well grown miss hamilton
in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor
infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee
as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon
passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering
former partialities and talking over old times

anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which
she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse
and be cheerful beyond her expectation  neither the dissipations
of the past  and she had lived very much in the world  nor the restrictions
of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have
closed her heart or ruined her spirits

in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness
and anne   astonishment increased  she could scarcely imagine
a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith    she had been
very fond of her husband  she had buried him  she had been
used to affluence  it was gone  she had no child to connect her
with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement
of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable 
her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom
behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without
assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford
and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had
moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation
and enjoyment  how could it be  she watched observed reflected
and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude
or of resignation only  a submissive spirit might be patient
a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more
here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted
that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment
which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone 
it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend
as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment
it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want

there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits
had nearly failed  she could not call herself an invalid now
compared with her state on first reaching bath  then she had indeed
been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey
and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again
confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having
a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit
to meet any extraordinary expense  she had weathered it however
and could truly say that it had done her good  it had increased
her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested
attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady
had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been
particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady
a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house
when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her 
and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably
has really proved an invaluable acquaintance  as soon as i could
use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement
and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases
pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about
and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood 
she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those
who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandize 
she always takes the right time for applying  everybody   heart is open
you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain
or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke
thoroughly understands when to speak  she is a shrewd intelligent
sensible woman  hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has
a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her
infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received
the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to 
call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour  
leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate
that is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one
know one   species better  one likes to hear what is going on
to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly 
to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat

anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied
i can easily believe it  women of that class have great opportunities
and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to 
such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing 
and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be
most interesting or affecting  what instances must pass before them
of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude
patience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most  a sick chamber may often furnish
the worth of volumes

yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may
though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe 
here and there human nature may be great in times of trial
but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength
that appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience
rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of 
there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately
speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget
to think seriously till it is almost too late

anne saw the misery of such feelings  the husband had not been
what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind
which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off
and soon added in a different tone  

i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present
will furnish much either to interest or edify me  she is only nursing
mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive
fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all
the high priced things i have in hand now

anne had called several times on her friend before the existence
of such a person was known in camden place  at last it became necessary
to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning
from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple
for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening
in westgate buildings  she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being
kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship
which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account
with great alacrity  she was engaged to spend the evening
with an old schoolfellow  they were not much interested in anything
relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked
to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth
was disdainful and sir walter severe

westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot
to be visiting in westgate buildings  a mrs smith  a widow mrs smith
and who was her husband  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names
are to be met with everywhere  and what is her attraction 
that she is old and sickly  upon my word miss anne elliot
you have the most extraordinary taste  everything that revolts
other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations
are inviting to you  but surely you may put off this old lady
till to morrow  she is not so near her end i presume
but that she may hope to see another day  what is her age  forty

no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can
put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time
which will at once suit her and myself  she goes into the warm bath
to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged

but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth

she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary
she approves it and has generally taken me when i have
called on mrs smith

westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter 
sir henry russell   widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms
but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known
to convey a miss elliot  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings 
a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty
a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names
in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot
and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility
of england and ireland  mrs smith  such a name

mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it
advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much
and did long to say a little in defense of her friend  
not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect
to her father prevented her  she made no reply  she left it
to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow
in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on
and no sirname of dignity

anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course
she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter
and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship   service themselves
but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others
and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot
and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early
and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements
in order to wait on her  anne had the whole history of all that
such an evening could supply from lady russell  to her
its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of
between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted
and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause 
her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow
sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot 
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners
mind a model of female excellence  he could meet even lady russell
in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand
so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated
by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations
which her friend meant to create

lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot 
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of
his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks
which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood
and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing 
she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject
she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter
of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance
supposing such attachment to be real and returned  anne heard her
and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed
and gently shook her head

i am no match maker as you well know said lady russell
being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events
and calculations  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence
pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him
i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together 
a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think
it might be a very happy one

mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects
i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit

lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that
to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch
the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying
your dear mother   place succeeding to all her rights
and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be
the highest possible gratification to me  you are your mother   self
in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you
such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing
in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued 
my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt
at my time of life

anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table
and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited  for a few moments her imagination and her heart
were bewitched  the idea of becoming what her mother had been
of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again
her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter
to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment
with propriety have spoken for himself  she believed in short
what anne did not believe  the same image of mr elliot speaking
for himself brought anne to composure again  the charm of kellynch
and of lady elliot all faded away  she never could accept him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man
save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities
of such a case was against mr elliot

though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied
that she really knew his character  that he was a sensible man
an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions
seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all
clear enough  he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix
on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would
have been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrusted the past
if not the present  the names which occasionally dropt
of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits
suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been 
she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling
had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life
and probably not a short one when he had been at least
careless in all serious matters and though he might now think
very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever
cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character 
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed

mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open 
there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight
at the evil or good of others  this to anne was a decided imperfection 
her early impressions were incurable  she prized the frank
the open hearted the eager character beyond all others 
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  she felt that she could
so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked
or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind
never varied whose tongue never slipped

mr elliot was too generally agreeable  various as were the tempers
in her father   house he pleased them all  he endured too well
stood too well with every body  he had spoken to her with some
degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see
what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet
mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body

lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend
for she saw nothing to excite distrust  she could not imagine
a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she
ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive
the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of
the following autumn



chapter 18


it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath
was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme 
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated 
it was three weeks since she had heard at all  she only knew
that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be
recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all
very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary
was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise
with admiral and mrs croft   compliments

the crofts must be in bath  a circumstance to interest her 
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally

what is this cried sir walter  the crofts have arrived in bath 
the crofts who rent kellynch  what have they brought you

a letter from uppercross cottage sir

oh those letters are convenient passports  they secure an introduction 
i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate 
i know what is due to my tenant

anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how
the poor admiral   complexion escaped her letter engrossed her 
it had been begun several days back


			  february 1st

my dear anne  i make no apology for my silence because i know
how little people think of letters in such a place as bath 
you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which
as you well know affords little to write about  we have had
a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party
all the holidays  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody 
the holidays however are over at last  i believe no children ever had
such long ones  i am sure i had not  the house was cleared yesterday
except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear
they have never gone home  mrs harville must be an odd mother
to part with them so long  i do not understand it  they are
not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to
like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren 
what dreadful weather we have had  it may not be felt in bath
with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence 
i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january
except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme
as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage is gone to day to bring louisa and the harvilles to morrow 
we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after
mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey
which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow 
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted
with him too but i have my usual luck  i am always out of the way
when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family
to be noticed  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying
with elizabeth  does she never mean to go away  but perhaps
if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this  i do not expect my children
to be asked you know  i can leave them at the great house very well
for a month or six weeks  i have this moment heard that the crofts
are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility
to give me any notice or of offering to take anything 
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours  we see nothing of them
and this is really an instance of gross inattention  charles joins me
in love and everything proper  yours affectionately
	mary     

i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has
just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore throat
very much about  i dare say i shall catch it and my sore throats
you know are always worse than anybody  


so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope
containing nearly as much more


i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa
bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal
to add  in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday
offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed
addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to
make my letter as long as i like  the admiral does not seem very ill
and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants 
i shall be truly glad to have them back again  our neighbourhood
cannot spare such a pleasant family  but now for louisa 
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little 
she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening
we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised
not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited
as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason 
neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa
and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer
from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her
before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville 
true upon my honour  are not you astonished  i shall be surprised
at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did 
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter 
we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her
marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter
and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick
is expected to day  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal
on his poor sister   account but however louisa is a great favourite
with both  indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her
the better for having nursed her  charles wonders what captain wentworth
will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa
i never could see anything of it  and this is the end you see
of captain benwick   being supposed to be an admirer of yours 
how charles could take such a thing into his head was always
incomprehensible to me  i hope he will be more agreeable now 
certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better
than marrying among the hayters


mary need not have feared her sister   being in any degree prepared
for the news  she had never in her life been more astonished 
captain benwick and louisa musgrove  it was almost too wonderful
for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain
in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions
of the moment  happily for her they were not many  sir walter
wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses
and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath
as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had
little curiosity beyond 

how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer
and pray what brings the crofts to bath

they come on the admiral   account  he is thought to be gouty

gout and decrepitude said sir walter  poor old gentleman

have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth

i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft  
time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance
in such a place as this

i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft
will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place

oh no i think not  situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance
she might not approve  if we were not related it would not signify
but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level 
there are several odd looking men walking about here who
i am told are sailors  the crofts will associate with them

this was sir walter and elizabeth   share of interest in the letter
when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention
in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys
anne was at liberty

in her own room she tried to comprehend it  well might charles wonder
how captain wentworth would feel  perhaps he had quitted the field
had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything
akin to ill usage between him and his friend  she could not endure
that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly

captain benwick and louisa musgrove  the high spirited
joyous talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking
feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything
that would not suit the other  their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction  the answer soon presented itself 
it had been in situation  they had been thrown together several weeks
they had been living in the same small family party  since henrietta  
coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other
and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state
and captain benwick was not inconsolable  that was a point which anne
had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing
the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events
they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some
dawning of tenderness toward herself  she did not mean however
to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary
might have allowed  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing
young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have
received the same compliment  he had an affectionate heart 
he must love somebody

she saw no reason against their being happy  louisa had fine
naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast
for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already
of course they had fallen in love over poetry  the idea of
louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste
and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt
of its being so  the day at lyme the fall from the cobb
might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to
the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have
influenced her fate

the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible
of captain wentworth   merits could be allowed to prefer another man
there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder
and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing
to be regretted  no it was not regret which made anne   heart
beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks
when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free 
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy senseless joy

she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place
it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove
was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile

the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street
perfectly to sir walter   satisfaction  he was not at all ashamed
of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more
about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him

the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for
and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together 
he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft
seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk
for her life to do him good  anne saw them wherever she went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning
and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them 
knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture
of happiness to her  she always watched them as long as she could
delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of
as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted
to see the admiral   hearty shake of the hand when he encountered
an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her

anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself
but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days
after the croft   arrival it suited her best to leave her friend
or her friend   carriage in the lower part of the town
and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street
she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral  he was standing
by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him
in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have
passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him
before she could catch his notice  when he did perceive and
acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness
and good humour  ha is it you  thank you thank you 
this is treating me like a friend  here i am you see
staring at a picture  i can never get by this shop without stopping 
but what a thing here is by way of a boat  do look at it 
did you ever see the like  what queer fellows your fine painters must be
to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that  and yet here are two gentlemen
stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks
and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment
which they certainly must be  i wonder where that boat was built
laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it 
well turning away now where are you bound  can i go anywhere
for you or with you  can i be of any use

none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company
the little way our road lies together  i am going home


that i will with all my heart and farther too  yes yes
we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you
as we go along  there take my arm that   right i do not
feel comfortable if i have not a woman there  lord what a boat it is
taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion

did you say that you had something to tell me sir

yes i have presently  but here comes a friend captain brigden
i shall only say how   ye do as we pass however  i shall not stop 
how   ye do  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife 
she poor soul is tied by the leg  she has a blister on one of her heels
as large as a three shilling piece  if you look across the street
you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother  shabby fellows
both of them  i am glad they are not on this side of the way 
sophy cannot bear them  they played me a pitiful trick once 
got away with some of my best men  i will tell you the whole story
another time  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson 
look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife 
ah the peace has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald 
how do you like bath miss elliot  it suits us very well 
we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets
full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat
and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings
and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch
ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal 
we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you
for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth 
the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way

when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again
for what he had to communicate  she hoped when clear of milsom street
to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait
for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had
gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was
not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way 
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began  

well now you shall hear something that will surprise you 
but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady
i am going to talk about  that young lady you know that we have
all been so concerned for  the miss musgrove that all this has been
happening to  her christian name  i always forget her christian name

anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa

ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name  i wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine christian names  i should never be out
if they were all sophys or something of that sort  well
this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he was courting her week after week  the only wonder was
what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain
was set to right  but even then there was something odd in their
way of going on  instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth
and then he went off to see edward  when we came back from minehead
he was gone down to edward   and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november  even sophy could
not understand it  but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all
for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being
to marry frederick is to marry james benwick  you know james benwick

a little  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick

well she is to marry him  nay most likely they are married already
for i do not know what they should wait for

i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne
and i understand that he bears an excellent character

oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick 
he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are
bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active
zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps
for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice

indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit
from captain benwick   manners  i thought them particularly pleasing
and i will answer for it they would generally please

well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too
piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality
sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick   manners better than his 
there is something about frederick more to our taste

anne was caught  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea
of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other
not at all to represent captain benwick   manners as the very best
that could possibly be and after a little hesitation
she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison
of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with  

and the thing is certainly true  it is not a mere bit of gossip 
we have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letter
from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it
in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross 
i fancy they are all at uppercross

this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore
i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain
wentworth   letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy 
it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him
and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out
on each side equally and without violence  i hope his letter
does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man

not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur
from beginning to end

anne looked down to hide her smile

no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has
too much spirit for that  if the girl likes another man better
it is very fit she should have him

certainly  but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing
in captain wentworth   manner of writing to make you suppose
he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear
you know without its being absolutely said  i should be very sorry
that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick
should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort

yes yes i understand you  but there is nothing at all of that nature
in the letter  he does not give the least fling at benwick
does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own
for wondering at it  no you would not guess from his way of writing
that he had ever thought of this miss what   her name for himself 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that i think

anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant
to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther 
she therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet
attention and the admiral had it all his own way

poor frederick said he at last  now he must begin all over again
with somebody else  i think we must get him to bath  sophy must write
and beg him to come to bath  here are pretty girls enough i am sure 
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other
miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson 
do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath



chapter 19


while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing
his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth
was already on his way thither  before mrs croft had written
he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him

mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay  they were
in milsom street  it began to rain not much but enough to
make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it
very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being
conveyed home in lady dalrymple   carriage which was seen waiting
at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore
turned into molland   while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple
to request her assistance  he soon joined them again successful
of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home
and would call for them in a few minutes

her ladyship   carriage was a barouche and did not hold
more than four with any comfort  miss carteret was with her mother
consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation
for all the three camden place ladies  there could be no doubt
as to miss elliot  whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none
but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility
between the other two  the rain was a mere trifle and anne was
most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was also
a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all
and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss anne  
and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left
to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them
with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were
obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay
had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal
that his cousin anne   boots were rather the thickest

it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party
in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne
as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly
captain wentworth walking down the street

her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that
she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable
and absurd  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her
it was all confusion  she was lost and when she had scolded
back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage
and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street
on a commission of mrs clay  

she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door
she wanted to see if it rained  why was she to suspect herself
of another motive  captain wentworth must be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always
so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other
of being worse than it was  she would see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of
captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies
evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined
a little below milsom street  he was more obviously struck
and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before
he looked quite red  for the first time since their renewed acquaintance
she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments 
all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects
of strong surprise were over with her  still however
she had enough to feel  it was agitation pain pleasure
a something between delight and misery

he spoke to her and then turned away  the character of his manner
was embarrassment  she could not have called it either cold or friendly
or anything so certainly as embarrassed 

after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again 
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably
much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible
of his being less at ease than formerly  they had by dint of being
so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now 
time had changed him or louisa had changed him  there was consciousness
of some sort or other  he looked very well not as if he had been
suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross
of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look
of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was
captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was

it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth
would not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him
that there was complete internal recognition on each side
she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance
expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away
with unalterable coldness

lady dalrymple   carriage for which miss elliot was growing
very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it 
it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay
and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd
in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey
miss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but
by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off
and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne
and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her

i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them 
the carriage would not accommodate so many  i walk  i prefer walking

but it rains

oh very little  nothing that i regard

after a moment   pause he said  though i came only yesterday
i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see
pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it
if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent
to let me get you a chair

she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating
her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present
and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot  he will be here in a moment
i am sure

she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly  there was no difference
between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme
admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner
of the privileged relation and friend  he came in with eagerness
appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay
was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away
without further loss of time and before the rain increased
and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his
a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you
being all that she had time for as she passed away 

as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth   party
began talking of them

mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy

oh no that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen there 
he is always with them half lives in the family i believe 
what a very good looking man

yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises
says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with

she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes
to look at her  it is not the fashion to say so but i confess
i admire her more than her sister

oh so do i

and so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliot 
anne is too delicate for them

anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have
walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word 
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing
could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting 
praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell
and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay  but just now
she could think only of captain wentworth  she could not understand
his present feelings whether he were really suffering much
from disappointment or not and till that point were settled
she could not be quite herself

she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet

another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long
he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not
recollect it  he might be only passing through  but it was more probable
that he should be come to stay  in that case so liable as every body was
to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood
see him somewhere  would she recollect him  how would it all be

she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove
was to marry captain benwick  it had cost her something to encounter
lady russell   surprise and now if she were by any chance
to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge
of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him

the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour
in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last
in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him
on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view
the greater part of the street  there were many other men about him
many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him 
she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea
of her recognising him so soon as she did herself  no it was
not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they
were nearly opposite  she looked at her however from time to time
anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out
though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew
was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of
lady russell   eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him  
of her being in short intently observing him  she could thoroughly
comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell   mind
the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment
she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him
and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him
of one personal grace

at last lady russell drew back her head  now how would she
speak of him

you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long
but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and
mrs frankland were telling me of last night  they described
the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this
side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest
and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number
and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess
i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description

anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain
either at her friend or herself  the part which provoked her most
was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have
lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them

a day or two passed without producing anything  the theatre or the rooms
where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough
for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the
elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting
more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation
sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because
her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening 
it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple 
of course they must attend  it was really expected to be a good one
and captain wentworth was very fond of music  if she could only have
a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should
be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred  elizabeth had turned from him
lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened
by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention

she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off
with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow 
mrs smith gave a most good humoured acquiescence

by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come 
who is your party

anne named them all  mrs smith made no reply but when she was
leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch
well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me
to morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding
that i may not have many more visits from you

anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment   suspense
was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away



chapter 20


sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest
of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple
must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires
in the octagon room  but hardly were they so settled when the door
opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone  anne was
the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke 
he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries
in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground 
their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing
of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed
right to be done

while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth
caught her ear  she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject
and on captain wentworth   making a distant bow she comprehended
that her father had judged so well as to give him that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time
by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself 
this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet
better than nothing and her spirits improved

after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert
their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last
that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not
he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit
with a little smile a little glow he said  

i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme  i am afraid you must have
suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you
at the time

she assured him that she had not

it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he
passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still
too painful but in a moment half smiling again added
the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences
which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful 
when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be
the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea
of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery

certainly i could have none  but it appears  i should hope it would be
a very happy match  there are on both sides good principles
and good temper

yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think
ends the resemblance  with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice
over every circumstance in favour of it  they have no difficulties
to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays 
the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter   comfort 
all this is much very much in favour of their happiness
more than perhaps  

he stopped  a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him
some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne   cheeks
and fixing her eyes on the ground  after clearing his throat however
he proceeded thus  

i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity
and in a point no less essential than mind  i regard louisa musgrove
as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding
but benwick is something more  he is a clever man a reading man
and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her
with some surprise  had it been the effect of gratitude
had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him
it would have been another thing  but i have no reason to suppose it so 
it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous
untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  a man like him
in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken 
fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her
was indeed attachment  a man does not recover from such
a devotion of the heart to such a woman  he ought not he does not

either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered
or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who
in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered
and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless
slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through
had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused
and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things
in a moment  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject
and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking
and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated
so far as to say  

you were a good while at lyme i think

about a fortnight  i could not leave it till louisa   doing well
was quite ascertained  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief
to be soon at peace  it had been my doing solely mine 
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak 
the country round lyme is very fine  i walked and rode a great deal
and the more i saw the more i found to admire

i should very much like to see lyme again said anne

indeed  i should not have supposed that you could have found
anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling  the horror and distress
you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits 
i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been
strong disgust

the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne
but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure 
one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it
unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was
by no means the case at lyme  we were only in anxiety and distress
during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal
of enjoyment  so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little
that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty
at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections
altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable

as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared
for whom they were waiting  lady dalrymple lady dalrymple
was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible
with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward
to meet her  lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot
and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant
advanced into the room  the others joined them and it was
a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth  their interesting
almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time
but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings
towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of
and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful
civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations 
she was in good humour with all  she had received ideas which
disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one
as being less happy than herself

the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back
from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw
that he was gone  she was just in time to see him turn into
the concert room  he was gone he had disappeared she felt
a moment   regret  but they should meet again  he would look for her
he would find her out before the evening were over and at present
perhaps it was as well to be asunder  she was in need of
a little interval for recollection

upon lady russell   appearance soon afterwards the whole party
was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves
and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence
in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers
and disturb as many people as they could

very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in 
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back
of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for
which did not seem within her reach and anne  but it would be
an insult to the nature of anne   felicity to draw any comparison
between it and her sister   the origin of one all selfish vanity
of the other all generous attachment

anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room 
her happiness was from within  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed
but she knew nothing about it  she was thinking only of
the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took
a hasty range over it  his choice of subjects his expressions
and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see
in only one light  his opinion of louisa musgrove   inferiority
an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder
at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment
sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes
and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had
a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance
were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship
and regard but by the tenderness of the past  yes some share of
the tenderness of the past  she could not contemplate the change
as implying less  he must love her

these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied
and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him
without even trying to discern him  when their places were determined on
and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not
her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening
she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way

the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches 
anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well
with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her 
miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object
of colonel wallis   gallantry was quite contented

anne   mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment
of the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for
the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific
and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better
at least during the first act  towards the close of it
in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained
the words of the song to mr elliot  they had a concert bill between them

this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words
for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of
but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend
to understand the language  i am a very poor italian scholar

yes yes i see you are  i see you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight
these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear
comprehensible elegant english  you need not say anything more
of your ignorance  here is complete proof

i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient

i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long
replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general
to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished
for modesty to be natural in any other woman

for shame for shame this is too much flattery  i forget what we are
to have next turning to the bill

perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance
with your character than you are aware of

indeed  how so  you can have been acquainted with it only since
i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of
in my own family

i knew you by report long before you came to bath  i had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately  i have been acquainted
with you by character many years  your person your disposition
accomplishments manner they were all present to me

mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  to have been
described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people
is irresistible and anne was all curiosity  she wondered
and questioned him eagerly but in vain  he delighted in being asked
but he would not tell

no no some time or other perhaps but not now  he would mention
no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot
as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited
the warmest curiosity to know her

anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with
partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford
captain wentworth   brother  he might have been in mr elliot   company
but she had not courage to ask the question

the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared
i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change

such she believed were his words but scarcely had she
received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds
immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial 
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking

a well looking man said sir walter a very well looking man

a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple  more air
than one often sees in bath  irish i dare say

no i just know his name  a bowing acquaintance  wentworth
captain wentworth of the navy  his sister married my tenant
in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch

before sir walter had reached this point anne   eyes had caught
the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing
among a cluster of men at a little distance  as her eyes fell on him
his seemed to be withdrawn from her  it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she
dared observe he did not look again  but the performance
was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention
to the orchestra and look straight forward

when she could give another glance he had moved away  he could not have
come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in 
but she would rather have caught his eye

mr elliot   speech too distressed her  she had no longer
any inclination to talk to him  she wished him not so near her

the first act was over  now she hoped for some beneficial change
and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them
did decide on going in quest of tea  anne was one of the few who
did not choose to move  she remained in her seat and so did lady russell
but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean
whatever she might feel on lady russell   account to shrink from
conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity 
she was persuaded by lady russell   countenance that she had seen him

he did not come however  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him
at a distance but he never came  the anxious interval
wore away unproductively  the others returned the room filled again
benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure
or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give
delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed 
to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth
once more without the interchange of one friendly look

in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which
was favourable for her  colonel wallis declined sitting down again
and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner
not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals
and a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herself
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before
much more within reach of a passer by  she could not do so
without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles
but still she did it and not with much happier effect
though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication
in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench
before the concert closed

such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth
was again in sight  she saw him not far off  he saw her too
yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees
came at last near enough to speak to her  she felt that something
must be the matter  the change was indubitable  the difference
between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room
was strikingly great  why was it  she thought of her father
of lady russell  could there have been any unpleasant glances 
he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain
wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing
and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over 
anne replied and spoke in defense of the performance so well
and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance
improved and he replied again with almost a smile  they talked
for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down
towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round 
it came from mr elliot  he begged her pardon but she must be applied to
to explain italian again  miss carteret was very anxious to have
a general idea of what was next to be sung  anne could not refuse
but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit

a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed
and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look
as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth
in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  he must wish her good night
he was going he should get home as fast as he could

is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck
by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging

no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for
and he was gone directly

jealousy of mr elliot  it was the only intelligible motive 
captain wentworth jealous of her affection  could she have believed it
a week ago three hours ago  for a moment the gratification was exquisite 
but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed 
how was such jealousy to be quieted  how was the truth to reach him 
how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations
would he ever learn of her real sentiments  it was misery to think
of mr elliot   attentions  their evil was incalculable



chapter 21


anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise
of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home
at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid
mr elliot was almost a first object

she felt a great deal of good will towards him  in spite of
the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard
perhaps compassion  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which
he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation
by his own sentiments by his early prepossession  it was altogether
very extraordinary flattering but painful  there was much to regret 
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case
was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth
and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad
her affection would be his for ever  their union she believed
could not divide her more from other men than their final separation

prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy
could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne
was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings 
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way

she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning
particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her
though it had been an appointment

an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne   recollections
of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features
and make her rejoice to talk of it  all that she could tell
she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there
and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had
already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening
than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars
of the company  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath
was well know by name to mrs smith

the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths
open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed 
they never miss a concert

yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were
in the room

the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties
with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them

i do not know  i do not think they were

old lady mary maclean  i need not ask after her  she never misses
i know and you must have seen her  she must have been in your own circle
for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur
round the orchestra of course

no that was what i dreaded  it would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses
to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is
for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen
very little

oh you saw enough for your own amusement  i can understand 
there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd
and this you had  you were a large party in yourselves
and you wanted nothing beyond

but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about
that the object only had been deficient

no no you were better employed  you need not tell me that you
had a pleasant evening  i see it in your eye  i perfectly see
how the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable
to listen to  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation

anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye

yes i do  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were
in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable
in the world the person who interests you at this present time
more than all the rest of the world put together

a blush overspread anne   cheeks  she could say nothing

and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause
i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness
in coming to me this morning  it is really very good of you
to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands
upon your time

anne heard nothing of this  she was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her friend   penetration unable to imagine
how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her 
after another short silence  

pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me 
does he know that i am in bath

mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised  a moment   reflection
shewed her the mistake she had been under  she caught it instantaneously
and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added
more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot

i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely
but it seems worn out now  it is a great while since we met

i was not at all aware of this  you never mentioned it before 
had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you

to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual
air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have 
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot  i want your interest with him 
he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness
my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself
of course it is done

i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness
to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect
that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot
a greater right to influence him than is really the case 
i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion 
you must consider me only as mr elliot   relation  if in that light
there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him
i beg you would not hesitate to employ me

mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said  

i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon 
i ought to have waited for official information  but now my dear
miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak 
next week  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to
think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on
mr elliot   good fortune

no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next 
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of
will be settled any week  i am not going to marry mr elliot 
i should like to know why you imagine i am

mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled
shook her head and exclaimed  

now how i do wish i understood you  how i do wish i knew
what you were at  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel
when the right moment occurs  till it does come you know
we women never mean to have anybody  it is a thing of course among us
that every man is refused till he offers  but why should you be cruel 
let me plead for my  present friend i cannot call him but for
my former friend  where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man 
let me recommend mr elliot  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him
from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis

my dear mrs smith mr elliot   wife has not been dead much above
half a year  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses
to any one

oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly
mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that   all  let him know me to be
a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required
which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements
of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps 
ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same  of course
he cannot be aware of the importance to me  well my dear miss elliot
i hope and trust you will be very happy  mr elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman  your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been  you are safe in all worldly matters
and safe in his character  he will not be led astray he will not be
misled by others to his ruin

no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open
to dangerous impressions  i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation
to do otherwise  but i have not known him long and he is not a man
i think to be known intimately soon  will not this manner
of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough  and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine
he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him  i assure you
i shall not  i assure you mr elliot had not the share which
you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert
of last night might afford  not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that  

she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much
but less would hardly have been sufficient  mrs smith would hardly
have believed so soon in mr elliot   failure but from the perception
of there being a somebody else  as it was she instantly submitted
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne
eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith
should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have
received the idea or from whom she could have heard it

do tell me how it first came into your head

it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much
you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing
in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you
in the same way  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago

and has it indeed been spoken of

did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when
you called yesterday

no  was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid  i observed
no one in particular

it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye
had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way
to let you in  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday
and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot 
she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority 
she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
the whole history repeated anne laughing  she could not make
a very long history i think of one such little article
of unfounded news

mrs smith said nothing

but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having
this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you
in any way that i could  shall i mention to him your being in bath 
shall i take any message

no i thank you  no certainly not  in the warmth of the moment
and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured
to interest you in some circumstances but not now  no i thank you
i have nothing to trouble you with

i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years

i did

not before he was married i suppose

yes he was not married when i knew him first

and  were you much acquainted

intimately

indeed  then do tell me what he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man 
was he at all such as he appears now

i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith   answer
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther
and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful  at last  

i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her
natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers
i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you 
there were many things to be taken into the account  one hates
to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief 
even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving
though there may be nothing durable beneath  however i have determined
i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted
with mr elliot   real character  though i fully believe that
at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him
there is no saying what may happen  you might some time or other
be differently affected towards him  hear the truth therefore
now while you are unprejudiced  mr elliot is a man without heart
or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks
only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty
of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without
risk of his general character  he has no feeling for others 
those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion 
oh he is black at heart hollow and black

anne   astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause
and in a calmer manner she added

my expressions startle you  you must allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will try to command myself  i will not abuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him  facts shall speak 
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him
and thought him as good as himself  the intimacy had been formed
before our marriage  i found them most intimate friends and i too
became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained
the highest opinion of him  at nineteen you know one does not
think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others
and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost
always together  we were principally in town living in very good style 
he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one
he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do
to support the appearance of a gentleman  he had always a home
with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother 
my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world
would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse
was open to him i know that he often assisted him

this must have been about that very period of mr elliot   life
said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to
my father and sister  i never knew him myself i only heard of him
but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to
my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage
which i never could quite reconcile with present times  it seemed
to announce a different sort of man

i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith  he had been
introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him
but i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invited
and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go  i can satisfy you
perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage
i knew all about it at the time  i was privy to all the fors and againsts
i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though
i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society
indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards
or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer
any question you may wish to put

nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her 
i have always understood they were not a happy couple  but i should
like to know why at that time of his life he should slight
my father   acquaintance as he did  my father was certainly disposed
to take very kind and proper notice of him  why did mr elliot draw back

mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life
had one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker
process than the law  he was determined to make it by marriage 
he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage
and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course
i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities
and invitations were designing a match between the heir
and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match
should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence 
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you 
he told me the whole story  he had no concealments with me 
it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath
my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father
and sister  he described one miss elliot and i thought
very affectionately of the other

perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes
spoke of me to mr elliot

to be sure i did very often  i used to boast of my own anne elliot
and vouch for your being a very different creature from  

she checked herself just in time

this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night
cried anne  this explains it  i found he had been used to hear of me 
i could not comprehend how  what wild imaginations one forms where
dear self is concerned  how sure to be mistaken  but i beg your pardon
i have interrupted you  mr elliot married then completely for money 
the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes
to his character

mrs smith hesitated a little here  oh those things are too common 
when one lives in the world a man or woman   marrying for money
is too common to strike one as it ought  i was very young
and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless
gay set without any strict rules of conduct  we lived for enjoyment 
i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me
other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible
in what mr elliot was doing  to do the best for himself
passed as a duty

but was not she a very low woman

yes which i objected to but he would not regard  money money
was all that he wanted  her father was a grazier her grandfather
had been a butcher but that was all nothing  she was a fine woman
had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins
thrown by chance into mr elliot   company and fell in love with him
and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side
with respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in being secured
of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself 
depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation
in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it 
his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour
of the family he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declare
that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his
for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included
but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say
on that subject  it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof
for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof

indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne  you have asserted
nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago 
this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he should be so different now

but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary
stay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet

anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired 
the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it
as she unlocked it said  

this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband
a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him
before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things
and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others
still more trivial from different people scattered here and there
while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed 
here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little
satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document
of former intimacy  i have now another motive for being glad
that i can produce it

this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells
and dated from london as far back as july 1803   

dear smith  i have received yours  your kindness almost overpowers me 
i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have
lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it 
at present believe me i have no need of your services
being in cash again  give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and miss 
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them
this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor
to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer 
the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again
he is quite fool enough  if he does however they will leave me in peace
which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  he is worse
than last year

i wish i had any name but elliot  i am sick of it  the name of walter
i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me
with my second   again meaning for the rest of my life
to be only yours truly  wm elliot

such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow
and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said  

the language i know is highly disrespectful  though i have forgot
the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man  mark his professions to my poor husband 
can any thing be stronger

anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification
of finding such words applied to her father  she was obliged to recollect
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour
that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies
that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others
before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter
which she had been meditating over and say  

thank you  this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing
you were saying  but why be acquainted with us now

i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling

can you really

yes  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago
and i will shew him as he is now  i cannot produce written proof again
but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what
he is now wanting and what he is now doing  he is no hypocrite now 
he truly wants to marry you  his present attentions to your family
are very sincere  quite from the heart  i will give you my authority 
his friend colonel wallis

colonel wallis you are acquainted with him

no  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that
it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  the stream
is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings
is easily moved away  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis
of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be
in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character
but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom
he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her 
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all
to her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you
very naturally brings it all to me  on monday evening my good friend
mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was
not romancing so much as you supposed

my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient  this will not do 
mr elliot   having any views on me will not in the least account
for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father 
that was all prior to my coming to bath  i found them on
the most friendly terms when i arrived

i know you did i know it all perfectly but  

indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information
in such a line  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands
of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another
can hardly have much truth left

only give me a hearing  you will soon be able to judge of
the general credit due by listening to some particulars
which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm 
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement  he had seen you
indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without
knowing it to be you  so says my historian at least  is this true 
did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west
to use her own words without knowing it to be you

he certainly did  so far it is very true  at lyme 
i happened to be at lyme

well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted  he saw you then
at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased
to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot
and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive
in his visits there  but there was another and an earlier
which i will now explain  if there is anything in my story which you know
to be either false or improbable stop me  my account states
that your sister   friend the lady now staying with you
whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter
as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves
and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating
handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation
and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter   acquaintance
of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise
that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger

here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say
and she continued  

this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family
long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye
upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then
visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest
in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath
for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas
colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things
and the reports beginning to prevail  now you are to understand
that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot   opinions
as to the value of a baronetcy  upon all points of blood and connexion
he is a completely altered man  having long had as much money
as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice
or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness
upon the consequence he is heir to  i thought it coming on
before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling 
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william  you may guess
therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be
very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution
of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here
for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance
and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means
of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady
if he found it material  this was agreed upon between the two friends
as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist
in every way that he could  he was to be introduced and mrs wallis
was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced 
mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven
as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was
his constant object and his only object till your arrival
added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way
called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject 
you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide
perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do

yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with
what i have known or could imagine  there is always something offensive
in the details of cunning  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me 
i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot
who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied 
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability
of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger
to be lessening or not

lessening i understand replied mrs smith  he thinks mrs clay
afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed
as she might do in his absence  but since he must be absent
some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure
while she holds her present influence  mrs wallis has an amusing idea
as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles
when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay 
a scheme worthy of mrs wallis   understanding by all accounts
but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it  why to be sure
ma am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else
and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart
is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter   making a second match 
she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know
and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have
some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through
mrs wallis   recommendation

i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little
thoughtfulness  it will be more painful to me in some respects
to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evidently
a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had
any better principle to guide him than selfishness

but mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carried away
from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest
of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied
against him but her attention was now called to the explanation
of those first hints and she listened to a recital which
if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith
proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her
very deficient both in justice and compassion

she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired
by mr elliot   marriage they had been as before always together
and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune 
mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender
of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance 
from his wife   account of him she could discern mr smith to have been
a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong
understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him
led by him and probably despised by him  mr elliot raised by
his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification
of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself
for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man
and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself
to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend  
probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths
accordingly had been ruined

the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship
of their friends and to prove that mr elliot   had better not be tried
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs
was fully known  with a confidence in mr elliot   regard
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had
appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such
as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to
without corresponding indignation

anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to
urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same
stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and
under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference
to any of the evils it might bring on her  it was a dreadful picture
of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments
that no flagrant open crime could have been worse  she had a great deal
to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae
of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been
merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence 
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only
the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend  
usual state of mind

there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances
of particular irritation  she had good reason to believe
that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been
for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of
its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures
and this property though not large would be enough to make her
comparatively rich  but there was nobody to stir in it 
mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself
equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness
and from employing others by her want of money  she had no
natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel
and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law 
this was a cruel aggravation of actually streightened means 
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble
in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be
even weakening her claims was hard to bear

it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne   good offices
with mr elliot  she had previously in the anticipation
of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it
but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature
since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred
that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman
he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne   feelings
as far as the observances due to mr elliot   character would allow
when anne   refutation of the supposed engagement changed
the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope
of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least
the comfort of telling the whole story her own way

after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but
express some surprise at mrs smith   having spoken of him so favourably
in the beginning of their conversation  she had seemed to recommend
and praise him

my dear was mrs smith   reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet
have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him
than if he had been your husband  my heart bled for you
as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable
and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife  they were wretched together 
but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her 
i was willing to hope that you must fare better

anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility
of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea
of the misery which must have followed  it was just possible that
she might have been persuaded by lady russell  and under such
a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had
disclosed all too late

it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference
which carried them through the greater part of the morning
was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend
everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved



chapter 22


anne went home to think over all that she had heard  in one point
her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  he stood as
opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness
and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief
he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed 
pity for him was all over  but this was the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concerned
for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling
for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister
and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing
how to avert any one of them  she was most thankful for her own
knowledge of him  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward
for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was
a reward indeed springing from it  mrs smith had been able to tell her
what no one else could have done  could the knowledge have
been extended through her family  but this was a vain idea 
she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her
and having done her best wait the event with as much composure
as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be
in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell
in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself


she found on reaching home that she had as she intended
escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them
a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself
and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening

i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth
with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints
so mrs clay says at least

indeed i do say it  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder
for an invitation  poor man  i was really in pain for him
for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty

oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game
to be soon overcome by a gentleman   hints  however when i found
how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father
this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit
an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together  they appear to
so much advantage in company with each other  each behaving so pleasantly 
mr elliot looking up with so much respect

quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however
to turn her eyes towards anne  exactly like father and son 
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son

oh i lay no embargo on any body   words  if you will have such
ideas  but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions
being beyond those of other men

my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence

well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him 
i did invite him you know  i sent him away with smiles 
when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park
for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him

anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew
such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival
of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with
her prime object  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate
the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging
placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license
of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have
done otherwise

to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room
and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her 
she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere
but now she saw insincerity in everything  his attentive deference
to her father contrasted with his former language was odious
and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith
she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness
or the sound of his artificial good sentiments 

she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke
a remonstrance on his side  it was a great object to her to escape
all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool
to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace
as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually led along  she was accordingly more guarded
and more cool than she had been the night before

he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where
he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much
to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken 
he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary
to kindle his modest cousin   vanity he found at least that it was
not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard
among the too commanding claims of the others  he little surmised
that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest
bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct
which were least excusable

she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath
the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part
of two days  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of
his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain 
it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her
but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party
seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort 
it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practiced
on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources
of mortification preparing for them  mrs clay   selfishness was
not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded
for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot  
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it

on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell
and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone
directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out
on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which
determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion 
she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk
of spending the morning in rivers street

very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love 
oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me
and pretend i have read it through  i really cannot be plaguing myself
for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out 
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications 
you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night 
i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her
at the concert  something so formal and arrange in her air
and she sits so upright  my best love of course

and mine added sir walter  kindest regards  and you may say
that i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil message
but i shall only leave my card  morning visits are never fair
by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little 
if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen
but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately

while her father spoke there was a knock at the door  who could it be 
anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot
would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off 
after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard
and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room

surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance
but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon
as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived
with an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth
were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were
at the white hart  so much was pretty soon understood
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into
the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration
anne could not draw upon charles   brain for a regular history
of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints
of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary
as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of

she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta
and captain harville beside their two selves  he gave her a very plain
intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw
a great deal of most characteristic proceeding  the scheme
had received its first impulse by captain harville   wanting to
come to bath on business  he had begun to talk of it a week ago
and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed
coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it
very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear
to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two
everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  but then
it had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother had
some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought
a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes
for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being
his mother   party that everything might be comfortable and easy
to captain harville and he and mary were included in it
by way of general convenience  they had arrived late the night before 
mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with
mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross

anne   only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for henrietta   wedding clothes to be talked of  she had imagined
such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent
the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that
very recently since mary   last letter to herself charles hayter
had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth
who could not possibly claim it under many years and that
on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty
of something more permanent long before the term in question
the two families had consented to the young people   wishes
and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months
quite as soon as louisa    and a very good living it was
charles added  only five and twenty miles from uppercross
and in a very fine country   fine part of dorsetshire 
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom
surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous
than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get
a special recommendation  not that he will value it as he ought
he observed charles is too cool about sporting that   the worst of him

i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad
that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve
equally well and who have always been such good friends
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other  
that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both

oh yes  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer
but he has no other fault to find  money you know coming down with
money  two daughters at once  it cannot be a very agreeable operation
and it streightens him as to many things  however i do not mean to say
they have not a right to it  it is very fit they should have
daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind
liberal father to me  mary does not above half like henrietta   match 
she never did you know  but she does not do him justice
nor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend to
the value of the property  it is a very fair match as times go
and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now

such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne
should be happy in their children   marriages  they do everything
to confer happiness i am sure  what a blessing to young people
to be in such hands  your father and mother seem so totally free
from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct
and misery both in young and old  i hope you think louisa
perfectly recovered now

he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered
but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing
or dancing it is quite different  if one happens only to shut the door
a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water
and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her
all day long

anne could not help laughing  that cannot be much to your taste
i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man

to be sure he is  nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think
i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself  i have a great value for benwick and when one can
but get him to talk he has plenty to say  his reading has done him
no harm for he has fought as well as read  he is a brave fellow 
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before 
we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in
my father   great barns and he played his part so well
that i have liked him the better ever since

here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles  
following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had
heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross
and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced
her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it  she would certainly
have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want
to lessen theirs

the visit passed off altogether in high good humour  mary was
in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change
and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law   carriage
with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place
that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought
and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house
as they were detailed to her  she had no demands on her father or sister
and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing rooms

elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal 
she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked
to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style
the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those
who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch 
it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better
and then elizabeth was happy again  these were her internal persuasions 
old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess
to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does
did not even ask her own sister   family though they were here a month 
and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove
put her quite out of her way  i am sure she would rather not come
she cannot feel easy with us  i will ask them all for an evening
that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat 
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before  they will be delighted
to come to morrow evening  it shall be a regular party small
but most elegant  and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitation
was given to the two present and promised for the absent
mary was as completely satisfied  she was particularly asked
to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret
who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not
have received a more gratifying attention  miss elliot was to have
the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning
and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her
and henrietta directly

her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present 
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes
but anne convinced herself that a day   delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart
to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn
with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form

they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves
and anne had the kindest welcome from each  henrietta was exactly
in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness
which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had
ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove   real affection had been won
by her usefulness when they were in distress  it was a heartiness
and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more
from the sad want of such blessings at home  she was entreated
to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day
and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return
she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance
and on charles   leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove  
history of louisa and to henrietta   of herself giving opinions
on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help
which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts
from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying
to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary
well amused as she generally was in her station at a window
overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have
her moments of imagining

a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  a large party
in an hotel ensured a quick changing unsettled scene  one five minutes
brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there
half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was
seemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends
were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with
captains harville and wentworth  the appearance of the latter
could not be more than the surprise of the moment  it was impossible
for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their
common friends must be soon bringing them together again 
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings
she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared
from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had
hastened him away from the concert room still governed 
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation

she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course
and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence  
surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts
must understand each other ere long  we are not boy and girl
to be captiously irritable misled by every moment   inadvertence
and wantonly playing with our own happiness  and yet
a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company
with each other under their present circumstances could only be
exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most
mischievous kind

anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay
i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her 
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now  they seemed
deep in talk  who is it  come and tell me  good heavens i recollect 
it is mr elliot himself

no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you 
he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back
till to morrow

as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her
the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret
that she had said so much simple as it was

mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin
began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting
still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne
to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir
and tried to be cool and unconcerned  her distress returned
however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between
two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves
quite in the secret  it was evident that the report concerning her
had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure
that it would now spread farther

do come anne cried mary come and look yourself  you will be too late
if you do not make haste  they are parting they are shaking hands 
he is turning away  not know mr elliot indeed  you seem to have
forgot all about lyme

to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment
anne did move quietly to the window  she was just in time to ascertain
that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed
before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off
on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel
at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons
of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot
certainly  he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all
or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair
recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well

the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off
and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with  

well mother i have done something for you that you will like 
i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night 
a     i a good boy  i know you love a play and there is room for us all 
it holds nine  i have engaged captain wentworth  anne will
not be sorry to join us i am sure  we all like a play 
have not i done well mother

mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness
for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary
eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming  

good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing 
take a box for to morrow night  have you forgot that we are engaged
to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked
to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all
the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them 
how can you be so forgetful

phoo phoo replied charles what   an evening party 
never worth remembering  your father might have asked us to dinner
i think if he had wanted to see us  you may do as you like
but i shall go to the play

oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do
when you promised to go

no i did not promise  i only smirked and bowed and said the word
happy  there was no promise

but you must go charles  it would be unpardonable to fail 
we were asked on purpose to be introduced  there was always
such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately 
we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too
whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  every attention
is due to mr elliot  consider my father   heir  the future
representative of the family

don   talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles 
i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow
to the rising sun  if i would not go for the sake of your father
i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir 
what is mr elliot to me  the careless expression was life to anne
who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and
listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought
his enquiring eyes from charles to herself

charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious
and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she
invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting
to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself
she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play
without her  mrs musgrove interposed

we had better put it off  charles you had much better go back
and change the box for tuesday  it would be a pity to be divided
and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father  
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play
if miss anne could not be with us

anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much
so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying  

if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home
excepting on mary   account would not be the smallest impediment 
i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy
to change it for a play and with you  but it had better
not be attempted perhaps  she had spoken it but she trembled
when it was done conscious that her words were listened to
and daring not even to try to observe their effect

it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day
charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife
by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would

captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place
probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards
and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne

you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy
the evening parties of the place

oh no  the usual character of them has nothing for me 
i am no card player

you were not formerly i know  you did not use to like cards
but time makes many changes

i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she
hardly knew what misconstruction  after waiting a few moments
he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling
it is a period indeed  eight years and a half is a period

whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne   imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds
he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta
eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out
and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else
should come in

they were obliged to move  anne talked of being perfectly ready
and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known
the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair
in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own
sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection
wherewith to pity her

their preparations however were stopped short  alarming sounds
were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open
for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give
a general chill  anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked
saw symptoms of the same  the comfort the freedom the gaiety
of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence
or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister 
how mortifying to feel that it was so

her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  captain wentworth
was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before 
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once 
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  the sequel
explained it  after the waste of a few minutes in saying
the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which
was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves 
to morrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party 
it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had
provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table
with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and
one card more decidedly for captain wentworth  the truth was
that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his 
the past was nothing  the present was that captain wentworth
would move about well in her drawing room  the card was pointedly given
and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared

the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out
but not to anne  she could think only of the invitation she had
with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which
it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather
than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance 
she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe
that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement
for all the insolence of the past  her spirits sank  he held the card
in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it

only think of elizabeth   including everybody whispered mary
very audibly  i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted 
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand

anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her

the party separated  the gentlemen had their own pursuits
the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while
anne belonged to them  she was earnestly begged to return and dine
and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been
so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more
and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent
as she chose

promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore
she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place
there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements
of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow   party the frequent enumeration
of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all
the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant
of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never ending
question of whether captain wentworth would come or not  they were
reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude
never appeased for five minutes together  she generally thought
he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case
which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion
as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings

she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation
to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot
three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath
for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview
from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her
there was guilt in mrs clay   face as she listened  it was transient 
cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there
the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick
or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend
perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs
on sir walter  she exclaimed however with a very tolerable
imitation of nature   

oh dear very true  only think miss elliot to my great surprise
i met with mr elliot in bath street  i was never more astonished 
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard  he had been prevented
setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what
for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer
for his being determined not to be delayed in his return 
he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow 
he was full of to morrow and it is very evident that i have been
full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension
of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have
gone so entirely out of my head



chapter 23


one day only had passed since anne   conversation with mrs smith
but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched
by mr elliot   conduct except by its effects in one quarter
that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer
her explanatory visit in rivers street  she had promised to be
with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plighted
and mr elliot   character like the sultaness scheherazade   head
must live another day

she could not keep her appointment punctually however
the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain
on her friends account and felt it very much on her own
before she was able to attempt the walk  when she reached the white hart
and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself
neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive 
the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft
and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard
that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment
it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest
injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there
till they returned  she had only to submit sit down
be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once
in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of
tasting a little before the morning closed  there was no delay
no waste of time  she was deep in the happiness of such misery
or the misery of such happiness instantly  two minutes after
her entering the room captain wentworth said  

we will write the letter we were talking of harville now
if you will give me materials

materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it
and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing

mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest
daughter   engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice
which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper 
anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet
as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk
she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as
how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again
to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day
and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred
to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what
i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded
to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style
of open hearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage
of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give
could be properly interesting only to the principals  mrs croft
was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke at all
it was very sensibly  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be
too much self occupied to hear

and so ma am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove
in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different
yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer
for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was
pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once
and make the best of it as many others have done before them 
at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement

that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft 
i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once
and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be
involved in a long engagement  i always think that no mutual  

oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her
finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people
as a long engagement  it is what i always protested against
for my children  it is all very well i used to say for young people
to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry
in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement  

yes dear ma am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement
an engagement which may be long  to begin without knowing
that at such a time there will be the means of marrying
i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents
should prevent as far as they can

anne found an unexpected interest here  she felt its application
to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table
captain wentworth   pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing
listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look
one quick conscious look at her

the two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of
a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation
but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear
her mind was in confusion

captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it
now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him
though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible
that he was inviting her to join him where he stood  he looked at her
with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed
come to me i have something to say and the unaffected
easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance
than he really was strongly enforced the invitation  she roused herself
and went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other end
of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer
to captain wentworth   table not very near  as she joined him
captain harville   countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful
expression which seemed its natural character

look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying
a small miniature painting do you know who that is

certainly  captain benwick

yes and you may guess who it is for  but in a deep tone
it was not done for her  miss elliot do you remember our
walking together at lyme and grieving for him  i little thought then  
but no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met with
a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise
to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her 
and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another 
it was a commission to me  but who else was there to employ 
i hope i can allow for him  i am not sorry indeed to make it
over to another  he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth
he is writing about it now  and with a quivering lip he wound up
the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon

no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe

it was not in her nature  she doted on him

it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved

captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that
for your sex and she answered the question smiling also
yes  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us 
it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselves 
we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us 
you are forced on exertion  you have always a profession pursuits
business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately
and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions

granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply
to benwick  he has not been forced upon any exertion  the peace
turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us
in our little family circle ever since

true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall
we say now captain harville  if the change be not from
outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature
man   nature which has done the business for captain benwick

no no it is not man   nature  i will not allow it to be more
man   nature than woman   to be inconstant and forget those they do love
or have loved  i believe the reverse  i believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are
the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage
and riding out the heaviest weather

your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit
of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender 
man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments 
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise 
you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with 
you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship 
your home country friends all quitted  neither time nor health
nor life to be called your own  it would be hard indeed
with a faltering voice if woman   feelings were to be
added to all this

we shall never agree upon this question captain harville
was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention
to captain wentworth   hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room 
it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was
startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined
to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been
occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think
he could have caught

have you finished your letter said captain harville

not quite a few lines more  i shall have done in five minutes

there is no hurry on my side  i am only ready whenever you are 
i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied
and want for nothing  no hurry for a signal at all  well miss elliot
lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree
i suppose upon this point  no man and woman would probably 
but let me observe that all histories are against you  all stories
prose and verse  if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you
fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think
i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say
upon woman   inconstancy  songs and proverbs all talk
of woman   fickleness  but perhaps you will say these were all
written by men

perhaps i shall  yes yes if you please no reference to examples
in books  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story 
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has
been in their hands  i will not allow books to prove anything

but how shall we prove anything

we never shall  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point 
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof 
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex
and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it
which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances
perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such
as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence
or in some respect saying what should not be said

ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling
if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes
a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat
that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight
and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again 
and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does
see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth   absence
perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon
it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself
and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while
hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last
as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still 
if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do
and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence 
i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own
with emotion

oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you
and by those who resemble you  god forbid that i should undervalue
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures 
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment
and constancy were known only by woman  no i believe you capable
of everything great and good in your married lives  i believe you equal
to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance
so long as  if i may be allowed the expression  so long as you have
an object  i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you 
all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one
you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence
or when hope is gone

she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart
was too full her breath too much oppressed

you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand
on her arm quite affectionately  there is no quarreling with you 
and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied

their attention was called towards the others  mrs croft was taking leave

here frederick you and i part company i believe said she 
i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend 
to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party
turning to anne  we had your sister   card yesterday
and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it
and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves

captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either
could not or would not answer fully

yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i
shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready
i am in half a minute  i know you will not be sorry to be off 
i shall be at your service in half a minute

mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter
with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried
agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  anne know not how
to understand it  she had the kindest good morning god bless you
from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look 
he had passed out of the room without a look

she had only time however to move closer to the table where
he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning
the door opened it was himself  he begged their pardon
but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room
to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper
placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her
for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room
almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it 
the work of an instant

the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost
beyond expression  the letter with a direction hardly legible
to miss a     was evidently the one which he had been folding
so hastily  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick
he had been also addressing her  on the contents of that letter
depended all which this world could do for her  anything was possible
anything might be defied rather than suspense  mrs musgrove had
little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection
she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied
succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written
her eyes devoured the following words 


i can listen no longer in silence  i must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach  you pierce my soul  i am half agony
half hope  tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings
are gone for ever  i offer myself to you again with a heart
even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years
and a half ago  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman
that his love has an earlier death  i have loved none but you 
unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been
but never inconstant  you alone have brought me to bath 
for you alone i think and plan  have you not seen this 
can you fail to have understood my wishes  i had not waited even
these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have
penetrated mine  i can hardly write  i am every instant hearing
something which overpowers me  you sink your voice but i can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others 
too good too excellent creature  you do us justice indeed 
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men 
believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in    

i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither
or follow your party as soon as possible  a word a look
will be enough to decide whether i enter your father   house
this evening or never


such a letter was not to be soon recovered from  half and hour   solitude
and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only
which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints
of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  every moment
rather brought fresh agitation  it was overpowering happiness 
and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation
charles mary and henrietta all came in

the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then
an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more 
she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged
to plead indisposition and excuse herself  they could then see
that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not
stir without her for the world  this was dreadful  would they only
have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room
it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or
waiting around her was distracting and in desperation
she said she would go home

by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly
and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening 
i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself 
charles ring and order a chair  she must not walk

but the chair would never do  worse than all  to lose the possibility
of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet
solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him
could not be borne  the chair was earnestly protested against
and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness
having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall
in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down
and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having
had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on
finding her better at night

anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said  

i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood 
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope
to see your whole party this evening  i am afraid there had been
some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville
and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both

oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word 
captain harville has no thought but of going

do you think so  but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry 
will you promise me to mention it when you see them again 
you will see them both this morning i dare say  do promise me

to be sure i will if you wish it  charles if you see captain harville
anywhere remember to give miss anne   message  but indeed my dear
you need not be uneasy  captain harville holds himself quite engaged
i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say

anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance
to damp the perfection of her felicity  it could not be very lasting
however  even if he did not come to camden place himself
it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence
by captain harville  another momentary vexation occurred 
charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her
there was no preventing him  this was almost cruel  but she could not
be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith  
to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling
but gratitude apparent

they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something
of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight
of captain wentworth  he joined them but as if irresolute
whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked 
anne could command herself enough to receive that look
and not repulsively  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed
and the movements which had hesitated were decided  he walked by her side 
presently struck by a sudden thought charles said  

captain wentworth which way are you going  only to gay street
or farther up the town

i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised

are you going as high as belmont  are you going near camden place 
because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you
to take my place and give anne your arm to her father   door 
she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help
and i ought to be at that fellow   in the market place 
he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off
said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment
that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance 
by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine
which you shot with one day round winthrop

there could not be an objection  there could be only the most
proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view
and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture 
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again
and the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed
between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet
and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make
the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all
the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives
could bestow  there they exchanged again those feelings
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything
but which had been followed by so many many years of division
and estrangement  there they returned again into the past
more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when
it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed
in a knowledge of each other   character truth and attachment
more equal to act more justified in acting  and there as they slowly
paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them
seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers
flirting girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in
those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  all the little
variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday
and today there could scarcely be an end

she had not mistaken him  jealousy of mr elliot had been
the retarding weight the doubt the torment  that had begun to operate
in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned
after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him
in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do
in the last four and twenty hours  it had been gradually yielding
to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions
occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by
those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked
with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which
he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings

of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her  she had never been supplanted 
he never even believed himself to see her equal  thus much indeed
he was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously
nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it
to be done  he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only
been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been
a sufferer from them  her character was now fixed on his mind
as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude
and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross
had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun
to understand himself  at lyme he had received lessons
of more than one sort  the passing admiration of mr elliot
had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at
captain harville   had fixed her superiority

in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove
the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever
felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care
for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection
which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence
of the mind with which louisa   could so ill bear a comparison
or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle
and the obstinacy of self will between the darings of heedlessness
and the resolution of a collected mind  there he had seen everything
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun
to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way

from that period his penance had become severe  he had no sooner
been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days
of louisa   accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again
than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty

i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man 
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our
mutual attachment  i was startled and shocked  to a degree
i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect
that others might have felt the same  her own family nay
perhaps herself  i was no longer at my own disposal  i was hers in honour
if she wished it  i had been unguarded  i had not thought seriously
on this subject before  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy
must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had
no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls
at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other
ill effects  i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences

he found too late in short that he had entangled himself
and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring
for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her
if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed 
it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere 
he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or
speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore
to his brother   meaning after a while to return to kellynch
and act as circumstances might require

i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy 
i could have no other pleasure  i deserved none  he enquired after you
very particularly asked even if you were personally altered
little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter

anne smiled and let it pass  it was too pleasing a blunder
for a reproach  it is something for a woman to be assured
in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm
of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased
to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be
the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment

he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride
and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa
by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement
with benwick

here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least
put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself
i could do something  but to be waiting so long in inaction
and waiting only for evil had been dreadful  within the first
five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was 
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive
with some degree of hope  you were single  it was possible that
you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement
happened to be mine  i could never doubt that you would be loved and
sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man
at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help
often saying was this for me

their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said
but the concert still more  that evening seemed to be made up
of exquisite moments  the moment of her stepping forward
in the octagon room to speak to him  the moment of mr elliot   appearing
and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments
marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on
with energy

to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be
my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match 
to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope
to influence you  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent
to consider what powerful supports would be his  was it not enough
to make the fool of me which i appeared  how could i look on
without agony  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you
was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence
the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done  
was it not all against me

you should have distinguished replied anne  you should not have
suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different 
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that
it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk 
when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called
in aid here  in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk
would have been incurred and all duty violated

perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not 
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired
of your character  i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed
buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under
year after year  i could think of you only as one who had yielded
who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me 
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery 
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now  the force of habit
was to be added

i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself
might have spared you much or all of this

no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement
to another man would give  i left you in this belief and yet
i was determined to see you again  my spirits rallied with the morning
and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here

at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived  all the surprise and suspense and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation
she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy
in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last 
an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective
of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went
to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness
of her enjoyment

the evening came the drawing rooms were lighted up the company assembled 
it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had
never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business
too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found
an evening shorter  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness
and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for
she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her 
mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him 
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them  lady dalrymple
and miss carteret  they would soon be innoxious cousins to her 
she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in
the public manners of her father and sister  with the musgroves
there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville
the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell
attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short
with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and
fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal
and with captain wentworth some moments of communications
continually occurring and always the hope of more and always
the knowledge of his being there

it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied
in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said  

i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially
to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself
and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it
that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom
you will love better than you do now  to me she was in the place
of a parent  do not mistake me however  i am not saying
that she did not err in her advice  it was perhaps one of those cases
in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides
and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance
of tolerable similarity give such advice  but i mean that i was right
in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have
suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up
because i should have suffered in my conscience  i have now
as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing
to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty
is no bad part of a woman   portion

he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her
replied as if in cool deliberation  

not yet  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time 
i trust to being in charity with her soon  but i too have been
thinking over the past and a  question has suggested itself
whether there may not have been one person more my enemy
even than that lady  my own self  tell me if when i returned
to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds
and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you
would you have answered my letter  would you in short
have renewed the engagement then

would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough

good god he cried you would  it is not that i did not think of it
or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success
but i was proud too proud to ask again  i did not understand you 
i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice 
this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one
sooner than myself  six years of separation and suffering
might have been spared  it is a sort of pain too which is new to me 
i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn
every blessing that i enjoyed  i have valued myself on honourable toils
and just rewards  like other great men under reverses he added
with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune 
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve



chapter 24


who can be in doubt of what followed  when any two young people
take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance
to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent
or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other   ultimate comfort 
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth
and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and
an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind
consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them
fail of bearing down every opposition  they might in fact
have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was
little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth 
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse
than look cold and unconcerned  captain wentworth with five and twenty
thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity
could place him was no longer nobody  he was now esteemed quite worthy
to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet
who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself
in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could
give his daughter at present but a small part of the share
of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter

sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne
and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion
was very far from thinking it a bad match for her  on the contrary
when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight
and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims
and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced
against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by
his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen
with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage
in the volume of honour

the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite
any serious anxiety was lady russell  anne knew that lady russell
must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot
and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with
and do justice to captain wentworth  this however was what
lady russell had now to do  she must learn to feel that she had
been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced
by appearances in each that because captain wentworth   manners
had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them
to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because
mr elliot   manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety
and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been
too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct
opinions and well regulated mind  there was nothing less
for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been
pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions
and of hopes

there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment
of character a natural penetration in short which no experience
in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted
in this part of understanding than her young friend  but she was
a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible
and well judging her first was to see anne happy  she loved anne
better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness
of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself
as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child

of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance  it was creditable to have a sister married
and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental
to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn
and as her own sister must be better than her husband   sisters
it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than
either captain benwick or charles hayter  she had something to suffer
perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored
to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette
but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation 
anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate
no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth
from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne

it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied
with her situation for a change is not very probable there 
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw
and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise
even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him

the news of his cousins anne   engagement burst on mr elliot
most unexpectedly  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness
his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness
which a son in law   rights would have given  but though discomfited
and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest
and his own enjoyment  he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay  
quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established
under his protection in london it was evident how double a game
he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself
from being cut out by one artful woman at least

mrs clay   affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed
for the young man   sake the possibility of scheming longer
for sir walter  she has abilities however as well as affections
and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers
may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being
the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last
into making her the wife of sir william

it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked
and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of
their deception in her  they had their great cousins to be sure
to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter
and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn
is but a state of half enjoyment

anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell   meaning
to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy
to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness
of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value 
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly  the disproportion
in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment   regret
but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly
nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her
in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain
as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise
strong felicity  she had but two friends in the world to add to his list
lady russell and mrs smith  to those however he was very well disposed
to attach himself  lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions
he could now value from his heart  while he was not obliged to say
that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them
he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour
and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her
quickly and permanently

her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves
and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend
secured her two  she was their earliest visitor in their settled life
and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering
her husband   property in the west indies by writing for her
acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties
of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man
and a determined friend fully requited the services which
she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife

mrs smith   enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income
with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends
to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not
fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity 
she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy
and yet be happy  her spring of felicity was in the glow
of her spirits as her friend anne   was in the warmth of her heart 
anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it
in captain wentworth   affection  his profession was all that could ever
make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war
all that could dim her sunshine  she gloried in being a sailor   wife
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession
which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues
than in its national importance

gorgono  and  slith  


 let us  by all means  be lucid   said gorgono to slith  slith fluttered
his reptile tongue and turned his morbid eyes to me   yes   he said 
 let us  certainly be lucid  bradbury  from now on use a contents page
in futuria fantasia   and he spanked his tail slickly on my typewriter 

i don   mind slith so much  he   only a little anachronistic reptile  a
descendent of happier days in dinosaurial dawndom  i never feared slith 
but gorgono 

gorgono pierced me with his slanting green  clear eyes  heavy lidded 
extending one claw and attempting to keep it from shaking while his
pointed ears stood up straight  a moment before he had been hunting
fleas in the fertile hair that clothed his muscular limbs  but now he
was serious  so very serious it frightened me 

and when the thunder voiced  evil eyed  shaggy haired and monstrous
gorgono reclined on the shelf over my head  saliva drooling with silent
precision from his pendulous lips  and gave orders i hastened to obey
them  gorgono was the voice of the critics  the ogre of opinion  the
harsh guttural commandment of style and fashion  and now gorgono had
grumbled   number your pages from now on  mister bradbury or else your
number ll be up  why  gad  man  the last issue of futuria fantasia i
didn   know if i was coming or going  the way you heiroglyphed the
sheets  and i might add  you re going to use even margins from here on
in  

 okay  okay  okay   i said  slinking with flushed visage behind my
stencils   but from now on futuria fantasia will be ten cents straight
an issue  ten cents straight    agreed   snapped gorgono   if you are
neater  but you must be new  neotiric  different   then i flashed them
the newly processed cover done by bok   gods   bellowed gorgono   that
is stupendous  a fine beginning  mortal  a very fine beginning   slith
agreed by pounding vigorously on the table with his scaly rump   and
wait until you read monroe   yarn   i jubilantly exclaimed   it   not
science fiction  but it   certainly a fine bit of story    yes   said
gorgono   this issue looks much better  glad to see you ve added two new
authors  damon knight and joe kelleam from astounding  i ll have to
remind the fans to send in their dimes for this issue and perhaps
support you a little more than they have with letters  but we ll see
about that   he got up  stretched  yawned  and vanished in a belching
ball of flame   yes   said slith   we ll see   and he too vanished with
a sharp pop  all was quiet  i went back to my stencils and my opium

heil 

by  lyle monroe 


 how dare you make such a suggestion  

the state physician doggedly stuck by his position   i would not make
it  sire  it your life were not at stake  there is no other surgeon in
the fatherland who can transplant a pituitary gland but doctor lans  

 you will operate  

the medico shook his head   you would die  leader  my skill is not
adequate  and unless the operation takes place at once  you will
 certainly  die  

the leader stormed about the apartment  he seemed about to give way to
one of the girlish bursts of anger that even the inner state clique
feared so much  surprisingly he capitulated 

 bring him here   he ordered 

doctor lans faced the leader with inherent dignity  a dignity and
presence that three years of  protective custody  had been unable to
shake  the pallor and gauntness of the concentration camp lay upon him 
but his race was used to oppression   i see   he said   yes  i see     i
can perform that operation  what are your terms  

 terms   the leader was aghast   terms  you filthy swine  you are being
given a chance to redeem in part the sins of your race  

the surgeon raised his brows   do you not think i  know  that you would
not have sent for me had there been any other course available to you 
obviously  my services have become valuable  

 you ll do as you are told  you and your kind are lucky to be alive  

 nevertheless i shall not operate without my fee  

 i said you were lucky to be alive    the tone was an open threat 

lans spread his hands   well  i am an old man     

the leader smiled   true  but i am informed that you have a  a
family     

the surgeon moistened his lips  his emma  they would hurt his emma    
and his little rose  but he must be brave  as emma would have him be  he
was playing for high stakes  for all of them   they cannot be worse off
dead   he answered firmly   than they are now  

it was many hours before the leader was convinced that lans could not be
budged  he should have known  the surgeon had learned fortitude at his
mother   breast 

 what is your fee  

 a passport for myself and my family  

 good riddance  

 my personal fortune restored to me   

 very well  

   to be paid in gold before i operate  

the leader started to object automatically  then checked himself
quickly  let the presumptuous fool think so  it could be corrected after
the operation 

 and the operation to take place in a hospital on foreign soil  

 preposterous  

 i must insist  

 you do not trust me  

lans stared straight back into his eyes without replying  the leader
struck him  hard  across the mouth  the surgeon made no effort to avoid
the blow  but took it  with no change of expression 

 you are willing to go through with it  samuel   the younger man looked
at doctor lans without fear as he answered 

 certainly  doctor  

 i can not guarantee that you will recover  the leader   pituitary gland
is diseased  when i exchange it for your healthy one your younger one
may not be able to stand up under it  that is the chance you take 
besides  a complete transplanting has never been done before  

 i know it  but i   out of the concentration camp  

 yes  yes  that is true  and if you do recover  you are free  and i will
attend you myself  until you are well enough to travel  

samuel smiled   it will be a positive joy to be sick in a country where
there are no concentration camps  

 very well  then  let us commence  

they returned to the silent  nervous group at the other end of the room 
grimly the money was counted out  every penny that the famous surgeon
had laid claim to before the leader had decided that men of his religion
had no need for money  lans placed half of the gold in a money belt and
strapped it around his waist  his wife concealed the other half
somewhere about her ample person 

it was an hour and twenty minutes later that lans put down the last
instrument  nodded to the surgeons assisting him  and commenced to strip
off operating gloves  he took one last look at his two patients before
he left the room  they were anonymous under the sterile gowns and
dressings  had he not known  he could not have guessed dictator from
oppressed  come to think of it  with the exchange of those two tiny
glands there was something of the dictator in his victim and something
of the victim in the dictator 

doctor lans returned to the hospital later in the day  after seeing his
wife and daughter safely settled in a first class hotel  it was an
extravagence  in view of his uncertain prospects as a refugee  but they
had enjoyed no luxuries for years back  there   he didn   consider it
his home country  and it was justified this once 

he inquired at the office of the hospital for his second patient  the
clerk looked puzzled   but he is not here     

 not here  

 why  no  he was moved at the same time as his excellency  back to your
country  

lans did not argue  the trick was obvious  it was too late to do
anything for poor samuel  he thanked his god that he had had the
foresight to place himself and his family beyond the reach of such
brutal injustice before operating  he thanked the clerk and left 

the leader recovered consciousness at last  his brain was confused  then
he recalled the events before he had gone to sleep  the operation   it
was over  and he was alive  he had never admitted to anyone how terribly
frightened he had been at the prospect  but he had lived  he had lived 
he groped around for the bellcord  and failing to find it  gradually
forced his eyes to focus on the room  what outrageous nonsense was this 
this was no sort of a room for the leader to convalesce in  he took in
the dirty white washed ceiling  and the bare wooden floor with distaste 
and the bed  it was no more than a cot 

he shouted  someone came in  a man wearing a uniform of a trooper in his
favorite corps  he started to give him the tongue lashing of his life 
before having him arrested  but he was cut short 

 cut out the racket  you unholy pig  

at first he was too astounded to answer  then he shrieked   stand at
attention when you address the leader  salute  

the trooper looked dumbfounded at the sick man  so totally different in
appearance from the leader  then guffawed  he stepped to the cot  struck
a pose with his right arm raised in salute  he carried a rubber
truncheon in it   hail to our leader   he shouted  and brought his arm
down smartly  the truncheon crashed into the sick man   cheek bone 

another trooper came in to see what the noise was while the first was
still laughing at his wittcism   what   up  jon  say  you   better not
handle that monkey too rough  he   still carried on the hospital list  
he glanced casually at the bloody face 

 him  didn   you know   jon pulled him to one side and whispered 

the second man   eyes widened  he grinned   so  they don   want him to
get well  eh  well  i could use a little exercise this morning   

 let   get fats   the other suggested   he   always so very amusing with
his ideas  

 good idea   he stepped to the door and bellowed   hey  fats  

they didn   really start in on him until fats was there to help

the phantoms

 by     joseph    kellerman


    all day they played among the purple flowers
    that lay like frozen flames upon the lawn 
    or dreamed within the shadows of the towers
    whose turret tops were painted as the dawn 
    bright was the garden  peace went everywhere
    there was no breath of movement nor any sound
    save butterflies that clove the heavy air 
    or when the bright fruit dropped slowly to the ground 
    then the flowers drooped  from sliver thorns that tore 
    too soon the sun had died in amber smoke 
    and frightened now but silent as before
    the phantoms watched the garden change its cloak 
    great sable moths flew out  and one by one
    the towers melted with the fallen sun

 thoughts on the  worldstate

 by henry kuttner 

 illustration 

 sidenote  the hideous mr  kuttner returns with an equally hideous tale 
we absolutely guarantee this story will induce nausea and slight
regurgitation  lead on  mckuttner  


i have  as usual  been brooding over the intricacies of modern
civilization  it seems to me that life is a peculiarly futile business 
this mood of mine may  perhaps  be attributed to my recent tragic
encounter with a horse at the corner of 42nd and broadway 

i shall not dwell upon that incident  save to mention briefly that
horses should  at least  be careful of what they eat  one never knows
the result of the most innocent action  and that  by imperceptible
degrees  brings me to the subject of this article  playing fair with
fans  or  fantastic decency 

it has been said  and very loudly  too  that fans fight a lot  well  i
do not care to refute that  i happen to know that a californian fan  a
mr  ackerman  is in the habit of knocking down visitors and kicking them
in strategic places  the question naturally arises  does fantasy lead to
sadism 

i am reminded of the remarkable case of scarlett o god  an ardent fan
whose tininess led to her being occasionally called by the diminutive 
or fanny  this may seem somewhat confusing at first glance  let us 
therefore  go hastily on to the next paragraph 

i should  perhaps  mention a mysterious white bearded gentleman called
tarboth the damned  or toby  since he played a significant role in the
incident  it was he who listened  toying at his beard idly  while
scarlett feverishly upheld her position against the onslaughts of her
foes  just what caused the argument i cannot recall at the moment  nor
does it matter especially  i believe it had something to do with
scarlett   being locked out of the sanctuary  or washroom  by previous
arrivals 

mocked  scorned  and jeered at  scarlett at first said nothing 
ultimately  however  she lost her temper and cursed her enemies roundly 
 i would   she observed with feeling   sell my soul to the devil in
order to obtain vengeance  

at this moment the white bearded gentleman smiled unpleasently and
vanished  simultaneously lightning struck the sanctuary and demolished
it  to the natural discomfiture of the occupants  laughing in a
triumphant manner  scarlett departed 

but the seeds of doom were already sown within her soul  not until she
was soaked to the skin did she realize the ghastly and hideous truth 
then  looking up  she saw that above her hovered a small black cloud 
from which rain was steadily descending  as she realized the terror of
her position  black horror flooded the girl  she had become allergic to
weather 

well  after that  of course  matters got steadily worse  she was driven
from home  after blasting the bathtub and spoiling a valuable angora
kitten   it was later made into a muff  but moths got into it  that 
however  is another story  and not an especially good one  

poor scarlett was excluded from all fan gatherings  sun stroke and
eclipse were her constant companions  she came with the deluge and was
gone with the wind 

the girl was utterly friendless  she roamed wildly here and there 
haggard  careworn and miserable  in a tattered gown made from the covers
of amazing stories  at night people could hear her moaning under their
windows  and they huddled closer to the fire  whispering   fetch aft the
rum  darby  evil walks abroad tonight and i feel my soul shudder in me 
no soda  thanks  

hopeless and forlorn  scarlett stowed away on a schooner out for hong
kong  but she was discovered  cursed for a jonah  and set ashore on a
cannibal isle in the south seas 

it was a blessing in disguise  the natives mistook her for a goddess 
they were used to bad weather  and did not attribute the altered climate
to scarlett 

so they garlanded her with leis and made her their queen 

and she rained happily ever after

    would you stroll with me  my loved one
       neath the pale venusian moon 
    where its misty orb goes drifting 
      waning  darling  all too soon 
    would you gaze into the rainbow
      where the lunar moonbeams play 
    could it be you   softly answer
      yes  for all those things i pray

 the piper 

 ron reynolds 

 illustration 


 lord  he   there again  he   there  look   the old man croaked  jabbing
a calloused finger at the burial hill   old piper again  as crazy as a
loon  every year that way  

the martian boy at the feet of the old man stirred his thin reddish feet
in the soil and affixed his large green eyes upon the burial hill where
the piper stood   why does he do that   asked the boy 

 ah   the old man   leathery face rumpled into a maze of wrinkles   he  
crazy  that   what  stands up there piping on his music from sunset
until dawn  

the thin piping sounds squealed in the dusk  echoed back from the low
hills  were lost in melancholy silence  fading  then louder  higher 
insanely  crying with shrill voice 

the piper was a tall  gaunt man  face as pale and wan as martian moons 
eyes electrical purple  standing against the soft of the dusking heaven 
holding his pipe to his lips  playing  the piper  a silhouette  a
symbol  a melody 

 where did the piper come from   asked the martian boy 

 from venus   the old man took out his pipe and filled it   oh  some
twenty years ago or more  on the projectile with the terrestrians  i
arrived on the same ship  coming from earth  we shared a double seat
together  

 what is his name   again the boyish  eager voice 

 i can   remember  i don   think i ever knew  really  

a vague rustling sound came into existence  the piper continued playing 
paying no heed to it  from the darkness  across the star jewelled
horizon  came mysterious shapes  creeping  creeping 

 mars is a dying world   the old man said   nothing ever happens of much
gravity  the piper  i believe  is an exile  

the stars trembled like reflections in water  dancing with the music 

 an exile   the old man continued   something like a leper  they called
him the brilliant  he was the epitome of all venerian culture until the
earthmen came with their greedy incorporations and licentious harlots 
the earthlings outlawed him  sent him here to mars to live out his
days  

 mars is a dying world   repeated the boy   a dying world  how many
martians are there  sir  

the old man chuckled   i guess maybe you are the last pure martian
alive  boy  but there are millions of others  

 where do they live  i have never seen them  

 you are young  you have much to see  much to learn  

 where do they live  

 out there  beyond the mountains  beyond the dead sea bottoms  over the
horizon and to the north  in the caves  far back in the subterrane  

 why  

 why  now that   hard to say  they were a brilliant race once upon a
time  but something happened to them  hybrided them  they are
unintelligent creatures now  cruel beasts  

 does earth own mars   the little boy   eyes were riveted upon the
glowing planet overhead  the green planet 

 yes  all of mars  earth has three cities here  each containing one
thousand people  the closest city is a mile from here  down the road  a
group of small metal bubble like buildings  the men from earth move
about among the buildings like ants enclosed in their space suits  they
are miners  with their huge machines they rip open the bowels of our
planet and dig out our precious life blood from the mineral arteries  

 is that all  

 that is all   the old man shook his head sadly   no culture  no art  no
purpose  greedy  hopeless earthlings  

 and the other two cities    where are they  

 one is up the same cobbled road five miles  the third is further still
by some five hundred miles  

 i am glad i live here with you  alone   the boy   head nodded sleepily 
 i do not like the men from terra  they are despoilers  

 they have always been  but someday   said the old man   they will meet
their doom  they have blasphemed enough  have they  they cannot  own 
planets as they have and expect nothing but greedy luxury for their
sluggishly squat bodies  someday       his voice rose high  in tempo and
pitch with the piper   wild music 

wild music  insane music  stirring music  music to stir the savage into
life  music to effect man   destiny 

     wild eyed piper on the hill 
    crying out your rigadoons 
    bring the savages to kill
     neath the waning martian moons  

 what is that   asked the boy 

 a poem   said the old man   a poem i have written in the last few days 
i feel something is going to happen very soon  the piper   song is
growing more insistent every night  at first  twenty years ago  he
played on only a few nights of every year  but now  for the last three
years he has played until dawn every night of every autumn when the
planet is dying  

 bring the savages   the boy sat up   what savages  

 there  

along the star glimmered mountain tops a vast clustering herd of black 
murmuring  advancing  the music screamed higher and higher 

     piper  pipe that song again 
    so he piped  i wept to hear  

 more of the poem   asked the boy 

 not my poem  but a poem from earth some seventy years ago  i learned it
in school  

 music is strange   the little boy   eyes were scintillant with thought 
 it warms me inside  this music makes me angry  why  

 because it is music with a purpose  

 what purpose  

 we shall know by dawn 

 music is the language of all things  intelligent or not  savage or
educated civilian  this piper knows his music as a god knows his heaven 
for twenty years he has composed his hymn of action and hate and
finally  tonight perhaps  the finale will be reached  at first  many
years ago  when he played  he received no answer from the subterrane 
but the murmur of gibbering voices  five years ago he lured the voices
and the creatures from their caves to the mountain tops  tonight  for
the first time  the herd of black will spill over the trails toward our
hovel  toward the road  toward the cities of man  

music screaming  higher  faster  insanely  sending shock after macabre
shock thru night air  loosening the stars from their riveted stations 
the piper stretched high  six feet or more  upon his hillock  swaying
back and forth  his thin shape attired in brown cloth  the black mass on
the mountain came down like amoebic tentacles  met and coalesced 
muttering and mumbling   go inside and hide   said the old man   you are
young  you must live to propagate the new mars  tonight is the end of
the old  tomorrow begins the new  it is death for the men of earth  
higher still and higher   death  they come to overrun the earthlings 
destroy their cities  take their projectiles  then  in the ships of
man  to earth  turnabout  revolution and revenge  a new civilization 
when monsters usurp men and men   greediness crumbles at his demise  
shriller  faster  higher  insanely tempoed   the piper  the brilliant
one  he who has waited for years for this night  back to venus to
reinstall the glory of his civilization  the return of art to humanity  

 but they are savages  these unpure martians   the boy cried 

 men are savages  i am ashamed of being a man   the old man said 
tremblingly   yes  these creatures are savages  but they will
learn  these brutes  with music  music in many forms    music for peace 
music for love  music for hate and music for death  the piper and his
brood will set up a new cosmos  he is immortal   now  hurrying 
muttering up the road  the first cluster of black things reminiscent of
men  a strange sharp odor in the air  the piper  from his hillock 
walking down the road  over the cobbles  to the city   piper  pipe that
song again   cried the old man   go and kill and live again  bring us
love and art again  piper  pipe the song  i weep   then   hide  child 
hide quickly  before they come  hurry   and the child  crying  hurried
to the small house and hid himself thru the night 

swirling  jumping  running  leaping  gamboling  crying  the new humanity
surged to man   cities  his rockets  his mines  the piper   song  stars
shuddered  winds stilled  nightbirds sang no songs  echoes murmured only
the voices of the ones who advanced  bringing new understanding  the old
man  caught in the whirlpool of ebon  was swept down  screaming  then up
the road  by the awful thousands  vomiting out of hills  sprawling from
caves  curling  huge fingers of beasts  around and about and down to the
man cities  sighing  leaping up  voices and destruction 

rockets across the sky 

guns  death 

and finally  in the pale advancement of dawn  the memory  the echoing of
the old man   voice  and the little boy arose to start afresh a new
world with a new mate 

echoing  the old man   voice 

 piper  pipe that song again  so he piped  i wept to hear  

a new day dawned

 the itching hour 

by damon knight


mind you  i don   believe the story  myself  it was obvious  from the
start  that the old man was mad  besides  i was stinko at the time  and
i may not have got some of the details right  but in its essentials  the
story still sticks in my mind     i can see the old man now  with a pair
of my best socks around his neck  moaning and wheezing and spitting on
the floor  and in between times telling his strange  strange story  of
course  the whole thing was fantastic  the old loon had probably escaped
from some nut factory     and yet     no  no  the old man was booby  and
yet     and yet    

the night it happened i was sitting in my study in my white silk russian
lounging robe  smoking a narghile or indian water pipe and throwing
darts at a signed photograph of sally rand  i   just pinked her neatly
in the gluteus maximus  when i was startled by a crash of glass  and
turned around to see an aged man tottering carefully thru the remains of
my french windows 

at once the chill of horror griped me  oops  i mean  gripped    unable
to move  i stared speechlessly as the old man went directly to my chest
of drawers and fumbled within  the overhead light throwing his face into
sombre shadow 

blowing his nose on one of my dress shirts he grumbled to himself about
the starch and selected a pair of lamb   wool socks and tied them around
his neck  this done  he hobbled over to a chair facing mine  sat down 
pulled his tattered undershirt  which for some reason he was wearing as
a shawl  more closely around his thin shoulders  stared reproachfully at
me  shivering at the icy blast that came in thru the shattered windows 
 there   a draft in here  and you know what you can do about it   he
complained 

 yes  there is   i managed to get out 

he nodded  satisfied   i thought there was   he said  then  dragging his
chair closer  he leaned over and  grasping me firmly by the lapels  said
pleasently   ipswitch on the amscray  don   you think  

half stifled with terror  i gasped   uh  yes   at once his manner was
transformed  drawing himself up indignantly he sneered  that   a lie 
that   what they all say  the sniveling hypocrites  they know it   a
lie  

then he drew nearer once again   but   he said   i   going to tell you
my story anyway  you have a kind face  and i  i just don   have any at
all   he raised the rim of his hat and i saw it was true  he had no
face  gibbering  i tried to get away  to flee or scram  but it was too
late  taking a firmer grip on my lapels  and standing heavily on my
foot  the old man began his story 

 you may not believe it  he began  but i  too  was once a carefree young
fan like yourself  from morning til night i thot of nothing but eating 
sleeping  sex  and my fan mag  puke  in the evening i would stay up til
morning  splashing happily in my hecto inks  and turning out pages and
pages of material like mad  and at last i   go to bed  tired but happy 
knowing i had done my duty as an honest fan 

 and then  one day  it happened  by some unfortunate chance  i got a
little double strength purple hectograph ink on my face  noticing it in
the mirror the next morning  as i was trying to decide whether to shave
this week or not  i took a washcloth and tried to rub off the stain 
alas  poor fool that i was  i recked not of the consequences 

 with hard rubbing  i managed to get some of the ink off  but when i
went on rubbing  to remove the rest  the ink i had rubbed off was
transferred back to my face  and so it went  the adament ink going from
washrag to face and from face back to washrag 

 the ink  as i have said  was double strength purple undiluted  and
suffered nothing in the process  but something had to give way  the
washrag  by an unhappy coincidence  was a brand new one  and my face was
some years old  only one thing could have happened  it did  

thus  shedding a tear on the carpet  the old stranger ended his weird
tale  getting slowly to his feet  he drew his hat down over his eyes
once more  tied his socks around his neck more tightly  and shuffled off
toward the shattered windows  at the sill  he turned  faced the room 
and made one last parting shot  ere he vanished in the gloom    dogs
have fleas    he screamed 

but sometimes i wonder

    i ve never seen a flirtenflog 
    i ve heard that it   a martian dog

    they say the bittern and the cormorant
    have nested in the upper lintels there 
    the wind builds flowers of dust upon the air 
    lifting and falling  slow and hesitant 
    within the crumbling temples beasts have laired 
    eyeless the windows  broken the terraces 
    no laughter breaks the silence  the palaces
    are weathered and the cedar work is bared 

    if this be glory   wage  then let me trust
    the fragile things that are not built of might 
    the lovely things that leave no trace when gone 
    the rose that swiftly turns into the dust 
    beauty that blazed a moment    or a night
    of golden stars forgotten with the dawn

  sir 

i have received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me on
the 9th instant  as well as the memorial enclosed in it  i
communicated the paper to the marquis de castries  and i make no
doubt  but that the minister will take into consideration its
contents  as far as circumstances will permit  we are desirous to
adopt every measure  that may tend to the prosperity of the commerce
established between france and the united states  and we shall neglect
nothing to accomplish this object to the universal satisfaction of the
two countries  congress will greatly facilitate our labor  if they
will communicate their ideas and wishes on this subject  and i make
the request with greater confidence  as i am convinced that that
assembly desires as much as we do to establish  on an advantageous and
solid basis  the commercial concerns between france and america 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i have received and laid before the king your letters of the 17th 
18th  and 21st ultimo  and i am commanded to signify to you his
majesty   approbation of your conduct in communicating to the american
commissioners the fourth article of your instructions  which could not
but convince them  that the negotiation for peace  and the cession of
independence to the thirteen united colonies  were intended to be
carried on and concluded with the commissioners in europe 

those gentlemen having expressed their satisfaction concerning that
article  it is hoped they will not entertain a doubt of his majesty  
determination to exercise  in the fullest extent  the powers with
which the act of parliament has invested him  by granting to america 
full  complete  and unconditional independence  in the most explicit
manner  as an article of treaty

  sir 

i have just received yours  no  13  dated the 23  of june  the
accounts of the general sentiments of our people  respecting
propositions from england  and the rejoicings on the birth of the
dauphin  give pleasure here  and it affords me much satisfaction to
find the conduct of congress approved by all who hear or speak of it 
and to see all the marks of a constantly growing regard for us  and
confidence in us  among those in whom such sentiments are most to be
desired 

i hope the affair of captain asgill was settled as it ought to be  by
the punishment of lippincott  applications have been made here to
obtain letters in favor of the young gentleman  enclosed i send you a
copy of the answer i gave to that made to me 

i had before acquainted    tousard  that his pension would be paid in
america  and there only  it being unreasonable to expect that congress
should open a pay office in every part of the world  where pensioners
should choose to reside  i shall communicate to him that part of your
letter 

you wish to know what allowance i make to my private secretary  my
grandson  william    franklin  came over with me  served me as a
private secretary during the time of the commissioners  and no
secretary to the commission arriving  though we had been made to
expect one  he did business for us all  and this without any allowance
for his services  though both mr lee and mr deane at times mentioned
it to me as a thing proper to be done  and in justice due to him  when
i became appointed sole minister here  and the whole business  which
the commissioners had before divided with me  came into my hands  i
was obliged to exact more service from him  and he was indeed  by
being so long in the business  become capable of doing more  at
length  in the beginning of the year 1781 when he became of age 
considering his constant close attention to the duties required  and
his having thereby missed the opportunity of studying the law  for
which he had been intended  i determined to make him some
compensation for the time past  and fix some compensation for the time
to come  till the pleasure of congress respecting him should be known 
i accordingly settled an account with him  allowing him from the
beginning of december 1776 to the end of 1777  the sum of 3 400
livres  and for the year 1778  the sum of 4 000 livres  for 1779 
4 800 livres  and for 1780  6 000 livres  since that time i have
allowed him at the rate of three hundred louis per annum  being what i
saw had been allowed by congress to the secretary of mr william lee 
who could not have had  i imagine  a fourth part of the business to go
through  since my secretary  besides the writing and copying the
papers relative to my common ministerial transactions  has had all
those occasioned by my acting in the various employments of judge of
admiralty  consul  purchaser of goods for the public          besides
that of accepting the congress bills  a business that requires being
always at home  bills coming by post  from different ports and
countries  and often requiring immediate answers  whether good or not 
and to that end  it being necessary to examine by the books  exactly
kept of all preceding acceptances  in order to detect double
presentations  which happen very frequently  the great number of these
bills makes almost sufficient business for one person  and the
confinement they occasion is such  that we cannot allow ourselves a
day   excursion into the country  and the want of exercise has hurt
our healths in several instances 

the congress pay much larger salaries to some secretaries  who  i
believe  deserve them  but not more than my grandson does the
comparatively small one i have allowed to him  his fidelity 
exactitude  and address in transacting business  being really what one
could wish in such an officer  and the genteel appearance a young
gentleman in his station obliges him to make  requiring at least such
an income  i do not mention the extraordinary business that has been
imposed upon us in this embassy  as a foundation for demanding higher
salaries than others  i never solicited for a public office  either
for myself  or any relation  yet i never refused one  that i was
capable of executing  when public service was in question  and i never
bargained for salary  but contented myself with whatever my
constituents were pleased to allow me  the congress will therefore
consider every article charged in my account  distinct from the salary
originally voted  not as what i presume to insist upon  but as what i
propose only for their consideration  and they will allow what they
think proper 

you desire an accurate estimate of those contingent expenses  i
enclose copies of two letters  1  which passed between mr adams and me
on the subject  and show the articles of which they consist  their
amount in different years may be found in my accounts  except the
article of house rent  which has never yet been settled     de
chaumont  our landlord  having originally proposed to leave it till
the end of the war  and then to accept for it a piece of american land
from the congress  such as they might judge equivalent  if the
congress did intend all contingent charges whatever to be included in
the salary  and do not think proper to pay on the whole so much  in
that case i would humbly suggest  that the saving may be most
conveniently made by a diminution of the salary  leaving the
contingencies to be charged  because they may necessarily be very
different in different years  and at different courts 

i have been more diffuse on this subject  as your letter gave occasion
for it  and it is probably the last time i shall mention it  be
pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  assure them of my
best services  and believe me to be  with sincere esteem     

                                                             franklin 

        as you will probably lay this letter before congress  i take
the liberty of joining to it an extract of my letter to the president 
of the 12th of march  1781  and of repeating my request therein
contained  relative to my grandson  i enclose  likewise  extracts of
letters from messrs jay and laurens  which both show the regard those
gentlemen have for him  and their desire of his being noticed by the
congress  2

                                             madrid  april 25th  1781 

  the letters herewith enclosed from dr franklin were left open for my
  perusal  the short stay of my courier at paris not allowing time for
  copies to be made of the information conveyed in and with it 

  i perceive that dr franklin desires to retire  this circumstance calls
  upon me to assure congress  that i have reason to be perfectly
  satisfied with his conduct towards me  and that i have received from
  him all the aid and attention i could wish or expect  his character is
  very high here  and i really believe  that the respectability he
  enjoys throughout europe has been of general use to our cause and
  country

                  extract of a letter from john jay 

                                             madrid  april 21st  1781 

  by the letter from dr franklin  herewith enclosed  and which he was so
  obliging as to leave open for my perusal  i find he has requested
  permission to retire  on account of his age  infirmities      how far
  his health may be impaired i know not  the letters i have received
  from him bear no marks of age  and there is an acuteness and
  sententious brevity in them  which do not indicate an understanding
  injured by years  i have many reasons to think our country much
  indebted to him  and i confess it would mortify my pride as an
  american  if his constituents should be the only people to whom his
  character is known  and that should deny to his merit and services the
  testimony given them by other nations  justice demands of me to assure
  you  that his reputation and respectability are acknowledged  and have
  weight here  and that i have received from him all that uniform
  attention and aid  which were due to the importance of the affairs
  committed to me 

  the affectionate mention he makes of his only descendant  on whom the
  support of his name and family will devolve  is extremely amiable  and
  flows in a delicate manner from that virtuous sensibility  by which
  nature kindly extends the benefits of parental affection  to a period
  beyond the limits of our lives  this is an affectionate subject  and
  minds susceptible of the finer sensations are insensibly led at least
  to wish that the feelings of an ancient patriot  going  in the evening
  of a long life early devoted to the public  to enjoy repose in the
  bosom of philosophic retirement  may be gratified by seeing some
  little sparks of the affection of his country rest on the only support
  of his age and hope of his family  such are the effusions of my heart
  on this occasion  and i pour them into yours  from a persuasion  that
  they will meet with a hospitable reception from congenial emotions

                                leagues    of ortegal  june 9th  1781 

    sir 

  i snatch a moment to pay my last respects to your excellency  and to
  mention a matter  which has occurred to me since my being on board  i
  have frequently reflected upon the mention  which your excellency has
  made of retiring from your present important station  and have never
  varied the opinion  which i took the liberty of giving you once at the
  count de vergennes   viz  that the best arrangement would be to give
  your excellency an active  intelligent secretary of the embassy  who
  might relieve you from the drudgery of office  and that your country
  should not be deprived of the advantages of your wisdom and influence 
  the difficulty hitherto has been to find a person properly qualified 
  the advantages  which your grandson derives from his knowledge of the
  language  and manners of the people  and his having been so long in
  your office  and with your excellency  are very great  the prejudices 
  which have been entertained against him  may be removed by a personal
  introduction to congress  especially if it is combined with rendering
  a popular service  i take the liberty of proposing to your excellency 
  therefore  if you can spare mr franklin for the purpose  to commit to
  his care the second remittance of money  and to hasten his departure
  with that  and as much of the public supplies of clothing      as may
  be ready to accompany it  i am persuaded  that in public bodies  the
  want of a personal acquaintance is a great objection to appointing a
  man to any important office 

  the engageante   boat demands my letter  i have written in the
  greatest haste upon a subject  which i hope your excellency will turn
  to public utility 

    i am     
                                                         john laurens 

                                                   

                              to john jay 

                                           passy  september 4th  1782 

  dear sir 

mr oswald   courier being returned  with directions to him to make the
independence of america the first article in the treaty  i would wait
on you if i could  to discourse on the subject  but as i cannot  i
wish to see you here this evening  if not inconvenient to you 

with great esteem  i have the honor to be  dear sir  your most
obedient and most humble servant 

                                                             franklin 

                                                   

                 robert    livingston to    franklin 

                                    philadelphia  september 5th  1782 

  sir 

having written to you lately  i should not again trouble you so soon 
were it not necessary to remind you  that your last letter is dated in
march  since which there have been frequent arrivals from france  and
since which too we have reason to believe  the most interesting
events have taken place in europe 

we learn from private letters and common fame  that mr adams was
received by the united provinces in his public character  on the 19th
of april  we have yet no account of this interesting event  nor of the
measures he has pursued to accomplish our other objects in holland 
since then mr laurens  it is said  has been liberated  has travelled
to holland and to france  has entered upon the execution of his trust 
but has left us to gather events so interesting to him and to us from
private letters  and the public prints  mr jay tells us on the 24th of
may  that he is about to set out for paris  and that he presumes dr
franklin has assigned the reasons for this step  doctor franklin has
told us nothing 

as to mr dana  if it were not for the necessity of drawing bills in
his favor  we should hardly be acquainted with his existence  it is
commonly said  that republics are better informed than monarchs of the
state of their foreign affairs  and that they insist upon a greater
degree of vigilance and punctuality in their ministers  we  on the
contrary  seem to have adopted a new system  the ignorance  in which
we are kept  of every interesting event  renders it impossible for the
sovereign to instruct their servants  and of course forms them into an
independent privy council for the direction of their affairs  without
their advice or concurrence  i can hardly express to you what i feel
on this occasion  i blush when i meet a member of congress  who
inquires into what is passing in europe  when the general applies to
me for advice on the same subject  which must regulate his movements 
i am compelled to inform him  that we have no intelligence but what he
has seen in the papers  the following is an extract of his last
letter to me   but how does it happen  that all our information of
what is transacting in europe should come to hand through indirect
channels  or from the enemy  or does this question proceed from my
unacquaintedness with facts  

but let me dismiss a subject  which gives me so much pain  in the hope
that we shall in future have no further cause of complaint 

since the evacuation of savannah  the enemy have by the general orders
contained in the enclosed papers  announced the proposed evacuation of
charleston  we are in daily expectation of hearing  therefore  that
tranquillity is restored to the southern states  several circumstances
lead us to suppose  that they entertain thoughts of abandoning new
york sometime this fall  you  only  can inform us  whether this step
has been taken in consequence of any expectations they entertain of a
general peace  or with a view to pursue the system  which the present
administration appears to have adopted  when they so loudly reprobate
the american war  and whether  by withdrawing their troops from hence
they only mean to collect their force and direct it against our
allies  this knowledge would render such an alteration in our system
necessary  that it affords us new reasons for regretting our want of
information on these important points 

the marquis de vaudreuil has unfortunately lost the magnifique  sunk
by running on a rock in the harbor of boston  where he is now  with
the remainder of his fleet  except three refitting at portsmouth 
consisting of twelve sail of the line  this has enabled congress to
show their attention to his most christian majesty  and their wish to
promote his interests as far as their circumstances will permit  by
presenting him the america  of seventyfour guns  enclosed are their
resolves on that subject  and the answer given by the minister of
france  the ship is in such a state  that she may by diligence be
refitted for sea in about two months  and from the accounts i hear of
her  she will i believe prove a fine ship  the general is collecting
the army  the last division of the french troops marched from here
this morning  when collected  they will  i presume  repair to their
old post  at the white plains  and perhaps endeavor to accelerate the
departure of the enemy 

i am sorry you did not pursue your first design  and enlarge in your
letter upon the subjects  which you imagined would be discussed in the
negotiations for peace  it might have changed our sentiments  and
altered our views on some points  two things are of great moment to
us  one of which at least would meet with no difficulty  if france and
england understand their true interests  i mean the west india trade 
and the right to cut logwood and mahogany  without a free admission of
all kinds of provisions into the islands  our agriculture will suffer
extremely  this will be severely felt at first  and when it remedies
itself  which it will do in time  it must be at the expense of the
nations that share our commerce  it will lessen the consumption of
foreign sugars  increase the supplies which the poorer people among us
draw from the maple      and by reducing the price of provision  and
rendering the cultivation of lands less profitable  make
proportionable increase of our own manufactures  and lessen our
dependence on europe  this will  i must confess  in some measure check
our population  and so far i regard it as an evil  the merchants and
farmers  if precluded at a peace from the advantages  which this
commerce gave them while connected with england        3  then a
variety of arguments on this subject  arising as well from the general
interests of france  as from her political connexion with us  might be
urged to show the wisdom of adopting the same liberal sentiments on
this point  which has of late distinguished her in so many others  but
if she should not be able to overcome her ancient prejudices  i
believe they will be found to have less influence on the british  whom
you will press earnestly on this head  besides the general interest of
the kingdom  there is with them a powerful west india interest  to
plead in behalf of a free importation of provisions into their
islands  if i mistake not  the present wishes of the nation  as well
as the professions of administration  lead to every measure  which may
wear away our present resentments  and strengthen the connexion
between us and them 

the logwood trade we have some claim to  from our continued exercise
of the right  nor can england pretend to exclude us from it  without
invalidating her own title  which stands upon the same ground  if
spain admits the right in england  she gains nothing by excluding us 
since in proportion as she diminishes our commerce in that article 
she increases that of great britain  other manufacturing nations are
interested in exciting a competition between us at their markets 

when you write to me  be pleased to be very particular in your
relation of every step  which leads to a negotiation  everything of
this kind must be interesting 

  i have the honor to be  sir

  sir 

in consequence of the notice i have just now had from mr jay of your
desire of an extract from my last letter from the secretary of state 
regarding the proposed treaty on the subject of american affairs  and
my authority in relation thereto  i take the liberty to send the same
enclosed  which  together with the powers contained in the commission 
which i had the honor of laying before you and mr jay  i am hopeful
will satisfy you of the willingness and sincere desire of his majesty
to give you entire content on that important subject 

this extract i would have sent before now  if i had thought you wished
to have it before i had the honor of waiting on you myself  which was
only delayed until i should be informed by mr jay  that you were well
enough to see me upon business 

i heartily wish you a recovery of your health  and am  with sincere
esteem and regard  sir  your most obedient humble servant

  sir 

i have received the honor of yours  dated the 5th instant  enclosing
an extract of a letter to your excellency  from the right honorable
thomas townshend  one of his majesty   principal secretaries of state 
wherein your conduct in communicating to us the fourth article of
your instructions appears to have been approved by his majesty  i
suppose  therefore  that there is no impropriety in my requesting a
copy of that instruction  and if you see none  i wish to receive it
from you  hoping it may be of use in removing some of the difficulties
that obstruct our proceeding  4 

with great and sincere esteem  i am  sir  your excellency   most

  my lord 

a long and severe indisposition has delayed my acknowledging the
receipt of the letter your lordship did me the honor of writing to me
by mr fitzherbert 

you do me justice in believing  that i agree with you in earnestly
wishing the establishment of an honorable and lasting peace  and i am
happy to be assured by your lordship  that it is the system of the
ministers with whom you are co operating  i know it to be the sincere
desire of the united states  and with such dispositions on both sides
there is reason to hope  that the good work in its progress will meet
with little difficulty  a small one has occurred in the commencement 
with which mr oswald will acquaint you  i flatter myself that means
will be found on your part for removing it  and my best endeavors in
removing the subsequent ones  if any should arise  may be relied on 

i had the honor of being known to your lordship   father  on several
occasions he manifested a regard for me  and a confidence in me  i
shall be happy if my conduct in the present important business may
procure me the same rank in the esteem of his worthy successor 

i am  with sincere respect  my lord  your lordship   most obedient and
most humble servant

  sir 

i have nothing to add to mine of the 5th instant  but to congratulate
you on the safe arrival of two vessels from holland  having on board
the goods left by commodore gillon  and to present you in the name of
mr paine  with three copies of a late work of his addressed to the
abbé raynal  in which he takes notice of some of the many errors with
which his work abounds  the abbé has a fine imagination  and he
indulges it  the enclosed resolution contains an important fact  which
i am using means to ascertain  but from the ill success i have
hitherto met with in every similar attempt  i am fearful that it will
be very long before i can effect it 

i have the honor to be  sir  with great respect and esteem  your most
obedient humble servant

  sir 

since writing the above  i have received the enclosed resolutions of
congress  i have already anticipated all that can be said upon the
subject of the last  the melancholy tale of our necessities is
sufficiently known to you  it has been too often repeated to need
recitation 

mr morris  who writes from an empty treasury amidst perpetual duns 
will speak more feelingly  in short  money must be obtained for us at
any rate  whether we have peace or war  france having already done
much for us  and it not being probable that we shall extend our
demands beyond the present  she may think it wise not to let us open
accounts with a new banker  since the debtor is always more or less
under obligations to the creditor 

i have the honor to be  sir  with respect and esteem

  my dear friend 

since those acknowledged in my last  i have received your several
favors of august the 16th  20th  and 26th  i have been a long time
afflicted with the gravel and gout  which have much indisposed me for
writing  i am even now in pain  but will no longer delay some answer 

i did not perfectly comprehend the nature of your appointment
respecting the refugees  and i supposed you would in a subsequent
letter explain it  but  as i now find you have declined the service 
such explanation is become unnecessary 

i did receive the paper you inquire about  entitled  preliminaries  
and dated may  1782  but it was from you  and i know nothing of their
having been communicated to this court  the third proposition   that
in case the negotiation between great britain and the allies of
america should not succeed  but the war continue between them  america
should act and be treated as a neutral nation   appeared at first
sight inadmissible  being contrary to our treaty  the truce too seems
not to have been desired by any of the parties 

with unalterable esteem and affection  i am  my dear friend  ever
yours

  sir 

just after closing my despatches  i was favored with yours of the 25th
of april  and the 25th and 29th of june  the ships that brought them
were so unfortunate as to be chased into the delaware by a superior
force  the eagle was driven ashore and sunk  the papers and money were
however happily saved  and part of the crew  but captain la fouche 
not having been since heard of  is supposed to be taken  the other
frigate has arrived safe  with all the passengers of both ships 

as i am just about to leave town for a short time  i will not touch
upon the important subject mentioned in your letters  which will on
account of my absence be committed to a special committee 

i would only observe to you  that the resolution in my last shows the
sense of congress on the subject of money matters 

you will see by the annexed resolutions  that congress have refused to
accept mr laurens   resignation  and that they have made some
alteration in your powers 

i send the papers  which contain the little news we have  and am  sir

  sir 

i received  on saturday last  your packets of the 10th and 11th of
this month 

a meeting of the king   confidential servants was held as soon as
possible  to consider the contents of them  and it was at once agreed
to make the alteration in the commission proposed by dr franklin and
mr jay  i trust that the readiness with which this proposal has been
accepted  will be considered as an ample testimony of the openness and
sincerity with which the government of this country is disposed to
treat with the americans 

the commission is passing with as much despatch as the forms of office
will allow  but i thought it material that no delay should happen  in
giving you notice of the determination of his majesty   council upon
this subject  you will receive the commission very soon after this
reaches you 

  i am  with great regard

i have the honor to send you my despatches for the chevalier de la
luzerne  the packet is voluminous  but it contains many duplicates 

i should be glad if it were in my power to inform him  that our treaty
is in as good progress as yours  but this is far from being the case 
i cannot even foresee what will be the issue  for difficulties
multiply  it will be well for you to forewarn the congress to be
prepared for whatever event may arise  i do not despair  i the rather
hope  but as yet all is uncertainty

  sir 

i have just received your no  15  dated the 9th of august  which
mentions your not having heard from me since march  i have  however 
written sundry letters  viz  of april the 8th  and june the 12th  june
the 25th and 29th  august the 12th  and september the 3   and sent
copies of the same  which i hope cannot all have miscarried 

the negotiations for peace have hitherto amounted to little more than
mutual professions of sincere desires       being obstructed by the
want of due form in the english commissions appointing their
plenipotentiaries  the objections made to those for treating with
france  spain and holland were first removed  and by the enclosed 5 
it seems that our objections to that for treating with us will now be
removed also  so that we expect to begin in a few days our
negotiations  but there are so many interests to be considered and
settled  in a peace between five different nations  that it will be
well not to flatter ourselves with a very speedy conclusion 

i mentioned  in a former letter  my having communicated to count de
vergennes the state of american commerce  which you sent me  and my
having urged its consideration      enclosed is a copy of a letter
received from that minister on the subject 

the copy of general carleton   letter  and the bills of exchange 
which you mentioned as enclosed  do not appear  i hope soon to have a
better opportunity of writing  when i shall be fuller 

  with great esteem

  my dear friend 

i only write one line to you  to let you know that i am not forgetful
of you  or of our common concerns  i have not heard anything from the
ministry yet  i believe it is a kind of vacation with them  before the
meeting of parliament  i have told you of a proposition  which i have
had some thoughts to make as a kind of copartnership in commerce  i
send you a purposed temporary convention  which i have drawn up  you
are to consider it only as one i recommend  the words underlined are
grafted upon the proposition of my memorial  dated may 19th  1778  you
will see the principle  which i have in my thoughts to extend for the
purpose of restoring our ancient copartnership generally 

i cannot tell you what event things may take  but my thoughts are
always employed in endeavoring to arrange that system upon which the
 china vase   lately shattered  may be cemented together  upon
principles of compact and connexion  instead of dependence 

i have met with a sentiment in this country which gives some alarm 
viz  lest the unity of government in america should be uncertain  and
the states reject the authority of congress  some passages in general
washington   letter have given weight to these doubts  i do not hear
of any tendency to this opinion   that the american states will break
to pieces  and then we may still conquer them   i believe all that
folly is extinguished  but many serious and well disposed persons are
alarmed  lest  this should be the ill fated moment for relaxing the
powers of the union  and annihilating the cement of confederation  
  vide  washington   letter   and that great britain should thereby
lose her best and wisest hope of being reconnected with the american
states  unitedly   i should for one think it the greatest misfortune 
pray give me some opinion upon this 

you see there is likewise another turn  which may be given to this
sentiment by intemperate and disappointed people  who may indulge a
passionate revenge for their own disappointments  by endeavoring to
excite general distrust  discord  and disunion  i wish to be prepared
and guarded at all points 

i beg my best compliments to your colleagues  be so good as to show
this letter to them  i beg particularly my condolence  and i hope
congratulation  to mr adams  i hear that he has been very dangerously
ill  but that he is again recovered  i hope the latter part is true 
and that we shall all survive to set our hands to some future compacts
of common interest  and common affection  between our two countries 

  your ever affectionate 

                                                              hartley

  sir 

i have but just received information of this opportunity  and have
only time allowed to write a few lines 

in my last of the 26th past  i mentioned that the negotiation for
peace had been obstructed  by the want of due form in the english
commissions appointing their plenipotentiaries  in that for treating
with us  the mentioning our states by their public name had been
avoided  which we objected to  another is come  of which i send a copy
enclosed  we have now made several preliminary propositions  which the
english minister  mr oswald  has approved  and sent to his court  he
thinks they will be approved there  but i have some doubts  in a few
days  however  the answer expected will determine  by the first of
these articles  the king of great britain renounces for himself and
successors  all claim and pretension to dominion or territory within
the thirteen united states  and the boundaries are described as in our
instructions  except that the line between nova scotia and new england
is to be settled by commissioners after the peace  by another article 
the fishery in the american seas is to be freely exercised by the
americans  wherever they might formerly exercise it while united with
great britain  by another  the citizens and subjects of each nation
are to enjoy the same protection and privileges  in each others  ports
and countries  respecting commerce  duties      that are enjoyed by
native subjects  the articles are drawn up very fully by mr jay  who i
suppose sends you a copy  if not  it will go by the next opportunity 
if these articles are agreed to  i apprehend little difficulty in the
rest  something has been mentioned about the refugees and english
debts  but not insisted on  as we declared at once  that whatever
confiscations had been made in america  being in virtue of the laws of
particular states  the congress had no authority to repeal those laws 
and therefore could give us none to stipulate for such repeal 

i have been honored with the receipt of your letters  nos 14 and 15  i
have also received two letters from mr lewis    morris  both dated
the 6th of july  and one dated the 10th of august  enclosing bills for

          68 290 livres 
          71 380
           9 756
                
  in all 149 426 livres 

being intended for the payment of ministers  salaries for the two
first quarters of this year  but as these bills came so late  that all
those salaries were already paid  i shall make no use of the bills 
but lay them by till further orders  and the salaries of different
ministers not having all the same times of falling due  as they had
different commencements  i purpose to get all their accounts settled
and reduced to the same period  and send you the state of them  that
you may be clear in future orders  i see in one of the estimates sent
me  that a quarter   salary of a minister is reckoned at 14 513
livres  in the other it is reckoned 16 667 livres  and the bill for
9 756 6  livres is mentioned as intended to pay a balance due on the
remittance of the 68 290 livres  being unacquainted with the state of
your exchange  i do not well comprehend this  and therefore leave the
whole for the present  as i have said above  permit me only to hint
for your consideration  whether it may not be well hereafter to omit
mention of sterling  in our appointments  since we have severed from
the country to which that denomination of money is peculiar  and also
to order the payment of your ministers in such a manner  that they may
know exactly what they are to receive  and not be subject to the
fluctuations of exchange  if it is that  which occasions the
difference between 14 583 for the first quarter  and the 16 667 for
the second  it is considerable  i think we have no right to any
advantage by the exchange  nor should we be liable to any loss from
it  hitherto we have taken 15 000 for a quarter   subject however to
the allowance or disallowance of congress  which is lower than the
medium between those two extremes 

the different accounts given of lord shelburne   character  with
respect to sincerity  induced the ministry here to send over    de
rayneval  secretary to the council  to converse with him  and endeavor
to form by that means a more perfect judgment of what was to be
expected from the negotiations  he was five or six days in england 
saw all the ministers  and returned quite satisfied  that they are
sincerely desirous of peace  so that the negotiations now go on with
some prospect of success  but the court and people of england are very
changeable  a little turn of fortune in their favor sometimes turns
their heads  and i shall not think a speedy peace to be depended on 
till i see the treaties signed  i am obliged to finish 

with great esteem

  sir 

a long and painful illness has prevented my corresponding with your
excellency regularly 

mr jay has  i believe  acquainted you with the obstructions our peace
negotiations have met with  and that they are at length removed  by
the next courier expected from london  we may be able perhaps to form
some judgment of the probability of success  so far as relates to our
part of the peace  how likely the other powers are to settle their
pretensions  i cannot yet learn  in the mean time  america is
gradually growing more easy  by the enemy   evacuation of their posts 
as you will see by some intelligence i enclose 

with great respect  i have the honor to be

  sir 

as mr strachey is going from hence to paris  with some particulars for
mr oswald  which were not easily to be explained in writing  i take
the liberty of introducing him to your acquaintance  though i am not
sure that he is not a little known to you  the confidential situation
in which he stands with me  makes me particularly desirous of
presenting him to you 

i believe  sir  i am enough known to you  for you to believe me  when
i say  that there has not been from the beginning a single person more
averse to the unhappy war  or who wishes more earnestly than i do  for
a return of peace and mutual amity between great britain and america 

i am  with great regard  sir  your most obedient humble servant

  sir 

i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me by mr
strachey  and was much pleased with the opportunity it gave me of
renewing and increasing my acquaintance with a gentleman of so amiable
and deserving a character 

i am sensible you have ever been averse to the measures that brought
on this unhappy war  i have  therefore  no doubt of the sincerity of
your wishes for a return of peace  mine are equally earnest  nothing 
therefore  except the beginning of the war  has given me more concern
than to learn at the conclusion of our conferences  that it is not
likely to be soon ended  be assured  no endeavors on my part would be
wanting to remove any difficulties that may have arisen  or even if a
peace were made  to procure afterwards any changes in the treaty that
might tend to render it more perfect  and the peace more durable  but
we  who are here at so great a distance from our constituents  have
not the possibility of obtaining in a few days fresh instructions  as
is the case with your negotiators  and are therefore obliged to insist
on what is conformable to those we have  and at the same time appears
to us just and reasonable 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be  sir

  sir 

the baron de kermelin  a swedish gentleman of distinction  recommended
strongly to me by his excellency  the ambassador of that nation to
this court  as a person highly esteemed in his own  purposes a journey
through north america  to view its natural productions  acquaint
himself with its commerce  and acquire such information as may be
useful to his country  in the communication and connexion of interests
that seem to be growing  and probably may soon become considerable
between the two nations  i therefore beg leave to introduce him to
you  and request that you would present him to the president of
congress  and to such other persons as you shall think may be useful
to him in his views  and i recommend him earnestly to those
civilities  which you have a pleasure in showing to strangers of
merit 

  i have the honor to be

  dear sir 

mr stewart  informing me that he shall set out tomorrow for paris 
will be the bearer of this  and duplicates of my last letters  the
want of time will prevent my sending mr jay duplicates of the
resolutions formerly enclosed to him  which will be the more
unnecessary as you will communicate those you receive with this  if my
former letters containing them  have not reached him 

we are much flattered by the proposals of sweden  and feel all the
force of its minister   observations  every new acknowledgment lays
the foundation of others  and familiarizes great britain with the idea
of acknowledging us as sovereign and independent  i feel some
pleasure  too  in thinking that you are to be the instrument of
procuring us new connexions  and beg leave to remind you of another
which calls upon your attention  though it seems to have been
forgotten in the hurry of business  i mean that with the states of
barbary  the good dispositions of the court of france towards us  and
the enlarged policy by which their measures are actuated  together
with the coolness that at present subsists between the emperor of
morocco and great britain   if we are well informed  seem to point out
this as the favorable moment for making ourselves known to him  as mr
jay is now with you  i wish you would consult upon the means of
bringing this about  so that we may not be shut out of the
mediterranean in future 

i know you will start a very obvious objection  but as this can only
be removed by your influence where you now are  we rely upon you for
the means as well as for the manner of treating  i have not thought it
necessary to say anything to congress on this subject  nor shall i 
till you give me hopes that something may be done in it 

the only political object of a general nature  that has been touched
upon in congress since my last  is the exchange of prisoners  which
seems at present to be as far as ever from being effected  the
propositions on the side of the enemy were to exchange seamen for
soldiers  they having no soldiers in their hands  that the soldiers so
exchanged should not serve for one year against the united states 
that the sailors might go into immediate service  that the remainder
of the soldiers in our hands should be given up at a stipulated price 

congress rejected this proposal as unequal  as letting loose a force 
which might be employed against our allies in the west indies  as
making no provision for the payment of the large balance due to us for
the maintenance of prisoners  they further required  that general
carleton should explicitly declare  that the powers he gives to his
commissioners for negotiating an exchange are derived from the king of
great britain  so that any engagement for the payment of the debt they
have incurred may be considered as binding upon the nation  with
respect to mr laurens  they have come to no decided opinion  the
committee to whom it was referred  reporting that 

 with respect to the information contained in the extract of sir guy
carleton   and admiral digby   letter of the 2  of august    that
after mr laurens was discharged  he declared that he considered lord
cornwallis as freed from his parole    your committee conceive it
sufficient to observe  that no intimation having been received of such
a fact  except  from the said extract  and congress having given no
directions to that purpose  the consideration thereof would in their
opinion be premature  and ought therefore to be deferred   since
which  though letters have been received from mr laurens  they have
come to no resolution  unless their direction to him to proceed in the
business of his mission may be considered as such 

general carleton has sent out the trial of lippincott  which admits
the murder of huddy  but justifies lippincott under an  irregular 
order of the board of refugees  so paltry a palliation of so black a
crime would not have been admitted  and captain asgill would certainly
have paid the forfeit for the injustice of his countrymen  had not the
interposition of their majesties prevented  the letter from the count
de vergennes is made the groundwork of the resolution passed on that
subject  i shall transmit you the resolve 

i suppose i need not tell you  that the enemy contrived to get off the
eagle and to carry her  to new york  you will find  in the enclosed
papers  a very polite letter from captain elphingston  it is easier to
be so in word than in deed among the british  digby has refused to
permit him to comply with his engagement  at least so far as his share
of the prize is concerned  and insists upon dividing the baggage of
the officers  and sharing the eighth pair of breeches     

on the 4th instant  mr boudinot was elected president in the room of
mr hanson  whose term of service had expired  mr lewis morris will
enclose bills purchased here at six shillings and three pence 
currency  for five livres  to the amount of your last quarter  
salary  ending the first of october 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

congress a few days since  passed the enclosed resolution  no  1  by
which they have added mr jefferson to the commission for concluding a
peace  the established character of this gentleman gives me reason to
hope  that his appointment will be very acceptable to you  and the
other gentlemen in the commission  i have not yet learned whether he
will take the task upon him  but i have reason to believe he will  the
death of his wife having lessened  in the opinion of his friends  the
reluctance which he has hitherto manifested to going abroad  i think
it would be proper to make a formal annunciation of this resolution to
the court of france  you will naturally give such a representation of
mr jefferson   character  as will secure to him there that esteem and
confidence which he justly merits  the resolution  no  2  needs no
comment  or if it does  mr morris will prove the able commentator  i
resign the task to him 

for what end are the show of negotiations kept up by england  when
peace upon the only terms she can possibly expect to obtain it is far
from her heart  her ministers  like some ministers of the gospel  who
are unwilling to quit the pulpit when they have tired out their
hearers  expect to keep the people together by calling out at every
period   now to conclude   while they continue the same dull tale for
want of skill to wind it up 

by accounts from jamaica  we learn that the british have recovered
most of their settlements on the bay  some attention will  i hope  be
paid in the treaty of peace to secure to us the share we formerly had
in the logwood trade  it was a valuable remittance to us  and the low
price at which we were enabled to sell renders it important to other
nations  that we should not be excluded from furnishing it as usual 
you will find by the enclosed paper  that mr burgess  an english
merchant  was not permitted to settle at boston and obtain the rights
of citizenship  upon principles which must be alarming to england  it
shows at the same time the respect that is paid to the resolutions of
congress  notwithstanding all that has been said and written to prove
the contrary 

  i am  sir

        i forgot to mention  that i am solicited by mr barlow to
transmit to you proposals for printing a work of his  which you will
find described in the enclosed proposals  as they are accompanied with
a specimen of his poetry  which is as much as i have seen of it  you
will judge yourself how far it deserves the patronage he wishes you to
give it

  sir 

you may well remember  that in the beginning of our conferences 
before the other commissioners arrived  on your mentioning to me a
retribution for the royalists  whose estates had been confiscated  i
acquainted you that nothing of that kind could be stipulated by us 
the confiscation being made by virtue of laws of particular states 
which the congress had no power to contravene or dispense with  and
therefore could give us no such authority in our commission  and i
gave it as my opinion and advice  honestly and cordially  that if a
reconciliation was intended  no mention should be made in our
negotiations of those people  for they having done infinite mischief
to our properties  by wantonly burning and destroying farm houses 
villages  and towns  if compensation for their losses were insisted
on  we should certainly exhibit again such an account of all the
ravages they had committed  which would necessarily recall to view
scenes of barbarity that must inflame  instead of conciliating  and
tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profess a desire of
extinguishing  understanding  however  from you  that this was a point
your ministry had at heart  i wrote concerning it to congress  and i
have lately received the following resolution  viz 

          by the united states  in congress assembled   

                                                 september 10th  1782 

      resolved  that the secretary for foreign affairs be  and he is
     hereby directed to obtain  as speedily as possible  authentic
     returns of the slaves and other property  which have been carried
     off or destroyed in the course of the war by the enemy  and to
     transmit the same to the ministers plenipotentiary for
     negotiating peace 

      resolved  that  in the meantime  the secretary for foreign
     affairs inform the said ministers  that many thousands of slaves 
     and other property  to a very great amount  have been carried
     off  or destroyed by the enemy  and that in the opinion of
     congress  the great loss of property  which the citizens of the
     united states have sustained by the enemy  will be considered by
     the several states as an insuperable bar to their making
     restitution or indemnification to the former owner of property 
     which has been  or may be forfeited to  or confiscated by any of
     the states  

in consequence of these resolutions and circular letters of the
secretary  the assembly of pennsylvania  then sitting  passed the
following act  viz 

             state of pennsylvania  in general assembly   

                                      wednesday  september 18th  1782 

 the bill  entitled  an act for procuring an estimate of the damages
sustained by the inhabitants of pennsylvania  from the troops and
adherents of the king of great britain during the present war   was
read a second time 

 ordered to be transcribed  and printed for public consideration 

  extract from the minutes 

                                                       peter    lloyd 

                                      clerk of the general assembly   

 whereas great damages  of the most wanton nature  have been committed
by the armies of the king of great britain  or their adherents within
the territory of the united states of north america  unwarranted by
the practice of civilized nations  and only to be accounted for from
the vindictive spirit of the said king and his officers  and whereas
an accurate account and estimate of such damages  more especially the
waste and destruction of property  may be very useful to the people of
the united states of america  in forming a future treaty of peace 
and  in the meantime  may serve to exhibit in a true light to the
nations of europe the conduct of the said king  his ministers 
officers  and adherents  to the end  therefore  that proper measures
be taken to ascertain the damages aforesaid  which have been done to
the citizens and inhabitants of pennsylvania  in the course of the
present war within this state  be it enacted by the house of
representatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  in
general assembly met  and by the authority of the same  that in every
county of this state  which has been invaded by the armies  soldiers 
or adherents of the king of great britain  the commissioners of every
such county shall immediately meet together  each within their county 
and issue directions to the assessors of the respective townships 
districts  and places within such county  to call upon the inhabitants
of every township and place  to furnish accounts and estimates of the
damages  waste  spoil  and destruction  which have been done and
committed as aforesaid  upon the property  real or personal  within
the same township or place  since the first day of     which was in
the year of our lord 177   and the same accounts and estimates to be
transmitted to the commissioners without delay  and if any person or
persons shall refuse or neglect to make out such accounts and
estimates  the said assessors of the township or place shall  from
their own knowledge  and by any other reasonable and lawful method 
take and render such an account and estimate of all damage done or
committed  as aforesaid  provided always  that all such accounts and
estimates to be made out and transmitted as aforesaid  shall contain a
narrative of the time and circumstances  and if in the power of the
person aggrieved  the names of the general  or other officers or
adherents of the enemy by whom the damage in any case was done  or
under whose orders the army  detachment  party  or persons  committing
the same  acted at that time  and also the name and condition of the
person or persons  whose property was so damaged or destroyed  and
that all such accounts and estimates be made in current money  upon
oath or affirmation of the sufferer  or of others having knowledge
concerning the same  and that in every case it be set forth  whether
the party injured hath received any satisfaction for his loss  and by
whom the same was given 

 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that the said
commissioners  having obtained the said accounts and estimates from
the assessor of the several townships and places  shall proceed to
inspect and register the same in a book  to be provided for that
purpose  distinguishing the districts and townships  and entering
those of each place together  and if any account and estimate be
imperfect  or not sufficiently verified and established  the said
commissioners shall have power  and they  or any two of them  are
hereby authorised to summon and compel any person  whose evidence they
shall think necessary  to appear before them at a day and place
appointed  to be summoned upon oath or affirmation  concerning any
damage or injury as aforesaid  and the said commissioners shall  upon
the call and demand of the president  or vice president of the supreme
executive council  deliver  or send to the secretary of the said
council  all or any of the original accounts and estimates aforesaid 
and shall also deliver  or send to the said secretary  copies of the
book aforesaid  or any part or parts thereof  upon reasonable notice 
and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that all losses
of negro or mulatto slaves and servants  who have been deluded and
carried away by the enemies of the united states  and who have not
been recovered or recompensed  shall be comprehended within the
accounts and estimates aforesaid  and that the commissioners and
assessors of any county  which had not been invaded as aforesaid 
shall nevertheless inquire after  and procure accounts and estimates
of any damages suffered by the loss of such servants and slaves  as is
herein before directed as to other property 

 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that the
charges and expenses of executing this act  as to the pay of the said
commissioners and assessors  shall be as in other cases  and that
witnesses shall be rewarded for their loss of time and trouble  as
witnesses summoned to appear in the courts of quarter sessions of the
peace  and the said charges and expenses shall be defrayed by the
commonwealth  but paid  in the first instance  out of the hands of the
treasurer of the county  for county rates  and levies upon orders
drawn by the commissioners of the proper county  

we have not yet had time to hear what has been done by the other
assemblies  but i have no doubt that similar acts will be made use of
by all of them  and that the mass of evidence produced by the
execution of those acts  not only of the enormities committed by those
people  under the direction of the british generals  but of those
committed by the british troops themselves  will form a record that
must render the british name odious in america to the latest
generations  in that authentic record will be found the burning of the
fine towns of charlestown  near boston  of falmouth  just before
winter  when the sick  the aged  the women and children  were driven
to seek shelter where they could hardly find it  of norfolk  in the
midst of winter  of new london  of fairfield  of esopus      besides
near a hundred and fifty miles of well settled country laid waste 
every house and barn burnt  and many hundreds of farmers  with their
wives and children  butchered and scalped 

the present british ministers  when they reflect a little  will
certainly be too equitable to suppose  that their nation has a right
to make an unjust war   which they have always allowed this against us
to be   and do all sorts of unnecessary mischief  unjustifiable by the
practice of any individual people  which those they make war with are
to suffer without claiming any satisfaction  but that if britons  or
their adherents  are in return deprived of any property  it is to be
restored to them  or they are to be indemnified  the british troops
can never excuse their barbarities  they were unprovoked  the
loyalists may say in excuse of theirs  that they were exasperated by
the loss of their estates  and it was revenge  they have then had
their revenge   is it right they should have both  

some of those people may have merit in their regard for britain  and
who espoused her cause from affection  these it may become you to
reward  but there are many of them who were waverers  and were only
determined to engage in it by some occasional circumstance or
appearances  these have not much of either merit or demerit  and there
are others  who have abundance of demerit respecting your country 
having by their falsehoods and misrepresentations brought on and
encouraged the continuance of the war  these  instead of being
recompensed  should be punished 

it is usual among christian people at war to profess always a desire
of peace  but if the ministers of one of the parties choose to insist
particularly on a certain article  which they have known the others
are not and cannot be empowered to agree to  what credit can they
expect should be given to such professions 

your ministers require that we should receive again into our bosom
those who have been our bitterest enemies  and restore their
properties who have destroyed ours  and this  while the wounds they
have given us are still bleeding  it is many years since your nation
expelled the stuarts and their adherents  and confiscated their
estates  much of your resentment against them may by this time be
abated  yet  if we should propose it  and insist on it as an article
of our treaty with you  that that family should be recalled and the
forfeited estates of its friends restored  would you think us serious
in our progressions of earnestly desiring peace 

i must repeat my opinion  that it is best for you to drop all mention
of the refugees  we have proposed  indeed  nothing but what we think
best for you as well as ourselves  but if you will have them
mentioned  let it be in an article  in which you may provide  that
they shall exhibit accounts of their losses to the commissioners 
hereafter to be appointed  who should examine the same  together with
the accounts now preparing in america of the damages done by them  and
state the account  and that if a balance appears in their favor  it
shall be paid by us to you  and by you divided among them as you shall
think proper  and if the balance is found due to us  it shall be paid
by you 

give me leave  however  to advise you to prevent the necessity of so
dreadful a discussion by dropping the article  that we may write to
america and stop the inquiry 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

an opportunity offering from this port to write directly to you  i do
not choose to hazard anything by the post  which carries this to
boston  particularly as i did not hear till just now  that a frigate
was to sail from thence  and it is uncertain whether this will arrive
in time to go by her  this then only accompanies the newspapers  which
contain all the public information now in circulation 

the memorials of messrs la marque and fabru are transmitted to south
carolina  as it is a matter in which the united states are not
concerned  it is to be hoped  that the state will do justice to the
claimants  if  as asserted  gillon acted under authority from them  he
has just left this with his ship  not in the most honorable manner 
having  as i am informed  been arrested by order of the proprietor of
the ship for his proportion of the prize money  the sheriff stands in
the gap 

the swiss officer mentioned in yours  i have sent to edenton to get
information about  you shall have the result of inquiries in my next 

as your grandson will probably choose to continue in the line he is
in  i cannot but think he might find important advantages from opening
a correspondence with this office  his diligence and accuracy in
collecting and transmitting intelligence would procure him friends
here  my attachment to you will render me desirous to place them in
the best light

sir 

i have just now received the certificates required by mr wallier  the
vessel which carries my other despatches having been long detained  i
embrace the opportunity to forward them  nothing new since my last 
except that  by a gentleman who left charleston the 4th instant  we
learn that the british had dismounted their cannon  and were certainly
on the point of leaving it 

i am  sir

  sir 

we detain the washington a little longer  expecting an english
passport for her in a few days  and as possibly some vessel bound for
north america may sail before her  i write this line to inform you 
that the french preliminaries with england are not yet signed  though
we hope they may be very soon  of ours i enclose a copy  the dutch and
spain have yet made but little progress  and as no definitive treaty
will be signed till all are agreed  there may be time for congress to
give us further instructions  if they think proper  we hope the terms
we have obtained will be satisfactory  though  to secure our main
points  we may have yielded too much in favor of the royalists  the
quantity of aid to be afforded us remains undecided  i suppose
something depends on the event of the treaty  by the washington you
will be fully informed of everything 

with great regard  i have the honor to be

                                            passy  december 5th  1782 

  sir 

i am honored by your several letters  nos 16  17  18 and 19  dated
september 5th  13th  15th  and 18th  i believe that the complaints you
make in them of my not writing  may ere now have appeared less
necessary  as many of my letters written before those complaints must
have since come to hand  i will nevertheless mention some of the
difficulties your ministers meet with  in keeping up a regular and
punctual correspondence  we are far from the seaports  and not well
informed  and often misinformed about the sailing of vessels 
frequently we are told they are to sail in a week or two  and often
they lie in the ports for months after  with our letters on board 
either waiting for convoy  or for other reasons  the post office here
is an unsafe conveyance  many of the letters we received by it have
evidently been opened  and doubtless the same happens to those we
send  and at this time particularly  there is so violent a curiosity
in all kinds of people to know something relating to the negotiations 
and whether peace may be expected  or a continuance of the war  that
there are few private hands or travellers  that we can trust with
carrying our despatches to the seacoast  and i imagine that they may
sometimes be opened and destroyed because they cannot be well sealed 
again  the observation you make  that the congress ministers in europe
seem to form themselves into a privy council  transacting affairs
without the privity or concurrence of the sovereign  may be in some
respects just  but it should be considered  that if they do not write
as frequently as other ministers here do to their respective courts 
or if when they write  their letters are not regularly received  the
greater distance of the seat of war  and the extreme irregularity of
conveyances may be the causes  and not a desire of acting without the
knowledge or orders of their constituents  there is no european court 
to which an express cannot be sent from paris in ten or fifteen days 
and from most of them answers may be obtained in that time  there is 
i imagine  no minister who would not think it safer to act by orders
than from his own discretion  and yet  unless you leave more to the
discretion of your ministers in europe than courts usually do  your
affairs may sometimes suffer extremely from the distance which  in the
time of war especially  may make it five or six months before the
answer to a letter shall be received  i suppose the minister from this
court will acquaint congress with the king   sentiments  respecting
their very handsome present of a ship of the line  people in general
here are much pleased with it 

i communicated  together with my memoir demanding a supply of money 
copies of every paragraph in your late letters  which express so
strongly the necessity of it  i have been constant in my solicitations
both directly  and through the marquis de lafayette  who has employed
himself diligently and warmly in the business  the negotiations for
peace are  i imagine  one cause of the great delay and indecision on
this occasion beyond what has been usual  as the quantum may be
different if those negotiations do or do not succeed  we have not yet
learnt what we may expect  we have been told that we shall be aided 
but it cannot be to the extent demanded  six millions have been
mentioned  but not as a sum fixed  the minister tells me still  that
he is working upon the subject  but cannot yet give a determinative
answer  i know his good will to do the best for us that is possible 

it is in vain for me to repeat again what i have so often written  and
what i find taken so little notice of  that there are bounds to
everything  and that the faculties of this nation are limited like
those of all other nations  some of you seem to have established as
maxims the suppositions  that france has money enough for all her
occasions  and all ours besides  and that if she does not supply us 
it is owing to her want of will  or to my negligence  as to the first 
i am sure it is not true  and to the second  i can only say i should
rejoice as much as any man in being able to obtain more  and i shall
also rejoice in the greater success of those who may take my place 
you desire to be very particularly acquainted with  every step which
tends to negotiation   i am  therefore  encouraged to send you the
first part of the journal  which accidents  and a long severe illness
interrupted  but which  from notes i have by me  may be continued if
thought proper  in its present state  it is hardly fit for the
inspection of congress  certainly not for public view  i confide it
therefore to your prudence 

the arrival of mr jay  mr adams  and mr laurens  has relieved me from
much anxiety  which must have continued  if i had been left to finish
the treaty alone  and it has given me the more satisfaction  as i am
sure the business has profited by their assistance 

much of the summer has been taken up in objecting against the powers
given by great britain  and in removing those objections  the not
using any expressions  that might imply an acknowledgment of our
independence  seemed at first industriously to be avowed  but our
refusing otherwise to treat  at length induced them to get over that
difficulty  and then we came to the point of making propositions 
those made by mr jay and me before the arrival of the other gentlemen 
you will find in the paper a  which was sent by the british
plenipotentiary to london for the king   consideration  after some
weeks  an under secretary  mr strachey  arrived  with whom we had much
contestation about the boundaries and other articles which he proposed
and we settled  some of which he carried to london  and returned with
the propositions  some adopted  others omitted or altered  and new
ones added  which you will see in paper    we spent many days in
disputing  and at length agreed on and signed the preliminaries  which
you will see by this conveyance  the british minister struggled hard
for two points  that the favors granted to the royalists should be
extended  and all our fishery contracted  we silenced them on the
first  by threatening to produce an account of the mischief done by
those people  and as to the second  when they told us they could not
possibly agree to it as we requested it  and must refer it to the
ministry in london  we produced a new article to be referred at the
same time  with a note of facts in support of it  which you have 
   8  apparently  it seemed  that to avoid the discussion of this 
they suddenly changed their minds  dropped the design of recurring to
london  and agreed to allow the fishery as demanded 

footnote 

   8  the papers alluded to in this letter will be found in the
  correspondence of the commissioners for negotiating peace 

you will find in the preliminaries some inaccurate and ambiguous
expressions  that want explanation  and which may be explained in the
definitive treaty  and as the british ministry excluded our
proposition relating to commerce  and the american prohibition of that
with england may not be understood to cease merely by our concluding a
treaty of peace  perhaps we may then  if the congress shall think fit
to direct it  obtain some compensation for the injuries done us as a
condition of our opening again the trade  every one of the present
british ministry has  while in the ministry  declared the war against
us as unjust  and nothing is clearer in reason  than that those who
injure others by an unjust war  should make full reparation  they
have stipulated too  in these preliminaries  that in evacuating our
towns  they shall carry off no plunder  which is a kind of
acknowledgment that they ought not to have done it before 

the reason given us for dropping the article relating to commerce 
was  that some statutes were in the way  which must be repealed before
a treaty of that kind could be well formed  and that this was a matter
to be considered in parliament 

they wanted to bring their boundary down to the ohio  and to settle
their loyalists in the illinois country  we did not choose such
neighbors 

we communicated all the articles  as soon as they were signed  to
count de vergennes   except the separate one  who thinks we have
managed well  and told me that we had settled what was most
apprehended as a difficulty in the work of a general peace  by
obtaining the declaration of our independency 

 december 14th   i have this day learnt  that the principal
preliminaries between france and england are agreed on  to wit 

1st  france is to enjoy the right of fishing and drying on all the
west coast of newfoundland  down to cape ray  miquelon and st pierre
to be restored  and may be fortified 

2   senegal remains to france  and goree to be restored  the gambia
entirely to england 

3   all the places taken from france in the east indies to be
restored  with a certain quantity of territory round them 

4th  in the west indies  grenada and the grenadines  st christophers 
nevis and montserat  to be restored to england  st lucia to france 
dominique to remain with france  and st vincents to be neutralized 

5th  no commissioner at dunkirk 

the points not yet quite settled are the territory round the places in
the indies  and neutralization of st vincents  apparently these will
not create much difficulty 

holland has yet hardly done anything in her negotiation 

spain offers for gibraltar to restore west florida and the bahamas  an
addition is talked of the island of guadaloupe  which france will cede
to spain in exchange for the other half of hispaniola  and spain to
england  but england  it is said  chose rather porto rico  nothing yet
concluded 

as soon as i received the commission and instructions for treating
with sweden  i waited on the ambassador here  who told me he daily
expected a courier on that subject  yesterday he wrote a note to
acquaint me  that he would call on me today  having something to
communicate to me  being obliged to go to paris  i waited on him  when
he showed me the full powers he had just received  and i showed him
mine  we agreed to meet on wednesday next  exchange copies  and
proceed to business  his commission has some polite expressions in it 
to wit   that his majesty thought it for the good of his subjects to
enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states of
america  who had established their independence so justly merited by
their courage and constancy   or to that effect  i imagine this treaty
will be soon completed  if any difficulty should arise  i shall take
the advice of my colleagues 

i thank you for the copies of mr paine   letter to the abbé raynal 
which i have distributed to good hands  the errors we see in
histories of our times and affairs weaken our faith in ancient
history     hilliard   auberteuil has here written another history of
our revolution  which however he modestly calls  an essay   and
fearing that there may be errors  and wishing to have them corrected 
that his second edition may be more perfect  he has brought me six
sets  which he desires me to put into such hands in america  as may be
good enough to render him and the public that service  i send them to
you for that purpose  by captain barney  desiring that one set may be
given to mr paine  and the rest where you please  there is a quarto
set in the parcel  which please to accept from me 

i have never learnt whether the box of books i sent to you  and the
press to mr thompson  were put on board the eagle or one of the
transports  if the former  perhaps you might easily purchase them at
new york  if the latter  you may still receive them among the goods
for congress  now shipping by mr barclay  if they are quite lost let
me know it  that i may replace them 

i have received several letters from your office with bills to pay
ministers  salaries  nothing has yet been done with those bills  but i
have paid mr laurens 20 000 livres 

i have this day signed a common letter to you drawn up by my
colleagues  which you will receive herewith  we have kept this vessel
longer for two things  a passport promised us from england  and a sum
to send in her  but she is likely to depart without both  being all of
us impatient that congress should receive early intelligence of our
proceedings  and for the money we may probably borrow a frigate 

i am now entering on my 78th year  public business has engrossed fifty
of them  i wish now to be  for the little time i have left  my own
master  if i live to see this peace concluded  i shall beg leave to
remind the congress of their promise then to dismiss me  i shall be
happy to sing with old simeon   now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation  

  with great esteem

  sir 

i have the honor to acquaint your excellency  that our courier is to
set out tomorrow at ten o clock  with the despatches we send to
congress  by the washington  captain barney  for which ship we have
got a passport from the king of england  9  if you would make any use
of this conveyance  the courier shall wait upon you tomorrow at
versailles  and receive your orders 

i hoped i might have been able to send part of the aids we have asked 
by this safe vessel  i beg that your excellency would at least inform
me what expectations i may give in my letters  i fear the congress
will be reduced to despair  when they find that nothing is yet
obtained

  sir 

i cannot but be surprised  sir  that after the explanation i have had
with you  and the promise you gave  that you would not press the
application for an english passport for the sailing of the packet
washington  that you now inform me  you have received the passport 
and that at ten o clock tomorrow morning your courier will set out to
carry your despatches  i am at a loss  sir  to explain your conduct
and that of your colleagues on this occasion  you have concluded your
preliminary articles without any communication between us  although
the instructions from congress prescribes  that nothing shall be done
without the participation of the king  you are about to hold out a
certain hope of peace to america  without even informing yourself on
the state of the negotiation on our part 

you are wise and discreet  sir  you perfectly understand what is due
to propriety  you have all your life performed your duties  i pray you
to consider how you propose to fulfil those  which are due to the
king  i am not desirous of enlarging these reflections  i commit them
to your own integrity  when you shall be pleased to relieve my
uncertainty  i will entreat the king to enable me to answer your
demands 

i have the honor to be  sir  with sincere regard  your very humble and
obedient servant

                                           passy  december 17th  1782 

  sir 

i received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to
me on the 15th instant  the proposal of having a passport from england
was agreed to by me the more willingly  as i at that time had hopes of
obtaining some money to send in the washington  and the passport would
have made its transportation safer  with that of our despatches  and
of yours also  if you had thought fit to make use of the occasion 
your excellency objected  as i understood it  that the english
ministers by their letters sent in the same ship  might convey
inconvenient expectations into america  it was therefore i proposed
not to press for the passport  till your preliminaries were also
agreed to  they have sent the passport without being pressed to do it 
and they have sent no letters to go under it  and ours will prevent
the inconvenience apprehended  in a subsequent conversation your
excellency mentioned your intention of sending some of the king  
cutters  whence i imagined  that detaining the washington was no
longer necessary  and it was certainly incumbent on us to give
congress as early an account as possible of our proceedings  who will
think it extremely strange to hear of them by other means  without a
line from us  i acquainted your excellency  however  with our
intention of despatching that ship  supposing you might possibly have
something to send by her 

nothing has been agreed in the preliminaries contrary to the interests
of france  and no peace is to take place between us and england  till
you have concluded yours  your observation is  however  apparently
just  that in not consulting you before they were signed  we have been
guilty of neglecting a point of  bienséance   but as this was not from
want of respect for the king  whom we all love and honor  we hope it
will be excused  and that the great work  which has hitherto been so
happily conducted  is so nearly brought to perfection  and is so
glorious to his reign  will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of
ours  and certainly the whole edifice sinks to the ground immediately 
if you refuse on that account to give us any further assistance 

we have not yet despatched the ship  and i beg leave to wait upon you
on friday for your answer 

it is not possible for any one to be more sensible than i am  of what
i and every american owe to the king  for the many and great benefits
and favors he has bestowed upon us  all my letters to america are
proofs of this  all tending to make the same impressions on the minds
of my countrymen  that i felt in my own  and i believe  that no prince
was ever more beloved and respected by his own subjects  than the king
is by the people of the united states   the english  i just now
learn  flatter themselves they have already divided us   i hope this
little misunderstanding will therefore be kept a secret  and that they
will find themselves totally mistaken 

with great and sincere respect  i am  sir  your excellency   most
obedient and most humble servant

  sir 

sundry circumstances occurring since mine of the 5th and 14th  have
hitherto retarded the departure of our despatches  they will now go
under the security of a british passport  be accompanied by a sum of
money  and by some further intelligence from england  which shows the
still unsettled state of minds there  and  together with the
difficulties and small progress in the dutch and spanish negotiations 
makes the speedy conclusion of peace still uncertain 

the swedish ambassador has exchanged full powers with me  i send a
copy of his herewith  we have had some conferences on the proposed
plan of our treaty  and he has despatched a courier for further
instructions respecting some of the articles 

the commissioners have joined in a letter to you  recommending the
consideration of a proposal from mr bridgen  relating to copper coin 
with this you have a copy of that proposal  and a sample of the
copper  if it should be accepted  i conceive the weight and value of
the pieces  charge of coinage deducted  should be such that they may
be aliquot parts of a spanish dollar  by the copy enclosed  of an old
letter of mine to mr bridgen  you will see the ideas i had of the
additional utility such a coinage might be of  in communicating
instruction  10 

 december 25th   enclosed is a copy of a letter just received from the
count de vergennes  upon the present state of negotiation with
england  11

  sir 

i was honored with your letters by the danae  i congratulate you upon
the promising state of our negotiations  since peace begins to be no
less desirable here than elsewhere 

but i will not enter into that subject at present  as i mean to write
very fully both to mr jay and you by mr jefferson  who will sail in
company with this frigate in the romulus  a ship of fortyfour guns 
lest  however  any accident should happen to prevent his arriving so
soon as the emerald  i enclose a resolution of congress  which was
suggested by the proposition you mention to have been made to mr
oswald  on the subject of commerce  for my own part  i presume that it
is already included in your propositions  but as we have yet been
favored only with that short note of them  which has been transmitted
by you  we can form no accurate judgment on the subject  you can
hardly conceive the embarrassments that the want of more minute
details subjects us to 

you will learn from the count de rochambeau  that the french army
sailed the 24th ult  perhaps it were to be wished that they had
remained here  at least till new york and charleston were evacuated 
or rather till the peace  congress have  however  given them a good
word at parting  as you will see by the enclosed resolves  not being
consulted  they could interpose no objections to their departure 
though they were not without many reasons for wishing to detain them 

our finances are still in great distress  if the war continues  a
foreign loan in addition to those already received will be essential 
a plan for ascertaining what shall be called contingent expenses  is
under the consideration of congress  as well as the objections you
have stated with respect to the mode of paying your salaries  which
will  i believe  be altered  the allowance to mr franklin has been
confirmed  and your moderation and his upon this point have done you
both honor in the opinion of congress 

  i have the honor to be  sir

                                      philadelphia  january 6th  1783 

  sir 

i have before me your letters of the 25th and 29th of june  12th of
august  3  and 26th of september  and 14th of october last  several
matters contained in them have already been answered  and some others
i am unable to reply to  till congress have decided on such
propositions as i have submitted to their consideration 

the convention relative to consuls has been objected to by mr barclay 
on account of its prohibiting the consuls from trading  as the funds
of congress leave them no means of affording an adequate support to
persons who are qualified  they fear  that the only inducement to
accept the appointment will be taken away by this prohibition  mr
barclay   letter on that subject is under consideration 

i see the force of your objections to soliciting the additional twelve
millions  and i feel very sensibly the weight of our obligations to
france  but every sentiment of this kind must give way to our
necessities  it is not for the interest of our allies to lose the
benefit of all they have done  by refusing to make a small addition to
it  or at least to see the return that our commerce will make them
suspended by new convulsions in this country  the army have chosen
committees  a very respectable one is now with congress  they demand
with importunity their arrears of pay  the treasury is empty  and no
adequate means of filling it presents itself  the people pant for
peace  should contributions be exacted  as they have heretofore been 
at the point of the sword  the consequences may be more dreadful than
is at present apprehended  i do not pretend to justify the negligence
of the states in not providing greater supplies  some of them might do
more than they have done  none of them all that is required  it is my
duty to confide to you  that if the war is continued in this country 
it must be in a great measure at the expense of france  if peace is
made  a loan will be absolutely necessary to enable us to discharge
the army  that will not easily separate without pay  i am sorry that
neither mr jay nor you sent the propositions at large  as you have
made them  since we differ in opinion about the construction to be put
on your commercial article  as you will find by a resolution enclosed
in my letter 

i wish the concession made of our trade may be on conditions of
similar privileges on the part of great britain  you will see that
without this precaution  every ally that we have  that is to be
treated as the most favored nation  may be entitled to the same
privileges  even though they do not purchase them by a reciprocal
grant 

as to confiscated property  it is at present in such a state  that the
restoration of it is impossible  english debts have not  that i know
of  been forfeited  unless it be in one state  and i should be
extremely sorry to see so little integrity in my countrymen  as to
render the idea of withholding them a general one  however  it would
be well to say nothing about them  if it can conveniently be done 

i am more and more convinced  that every means in your power must be
used to secure the fisheries  they are essential to some states  and
we cannot but hate the nation  that keeps us from using this common
favor of providence  it was one of the direct objects for carrying on
the war  while i am upon this subject  i cannot but express my hope 
that every means will be used to guard against any mistrusts or
jealousies between you and france  the united states have shown their
confidence in her by their instructions  she has repeatedly promised
to procure for us  all we ask   as far as it lies in her power  let
our conduct leave her without apology  if she acts otherwise  which i
am far from suspecting 

with respect to the seamen you mention  i wish if any further order is
necessary  than that which mr barclay already has  that you would give
it so far as to enable him to state their accounts  and transmit them
to mr morris  as the treaty with holland is concluded  i hope you have
made some progress in that with sweden  a plan of which has been
transmitted  another copy will go by mr jefferson 

i am glad to find you have some prospect of obtaining what is due on
the bon homme richard   prize money  that matter has been much spoken
of  and occasioned some reflection  as it is alleged that    chaumont
was imposed on the officers as their agent by the court  and of course
that they should be answerable for his conduct  which certainly has
been very exceptionable 

congress have come to no determination  as to the size or expense of
the pillar they propose to erect at yorktown  what i wished of you was
to send me one or two plans  with estimates of the expense  in order
to take their sense thereon 

as to the designs of spain  they are pretty well known  and mr jay and
congress concur so exactly in sentiment with respect to them  that i
hope we have now nothing to fear from that quarter 

congress have it now under consideration to determine what should be
allowed as contingent expenses  i believe house rent will not be
allowed as such  i mentioned in my last what respected your grandson 
to which i have nothing to add  i agree with you in sentiment  that
your salaries should not depend on the fluctuations of the exchange 
and have submitted that part of your letter to congress  i believe
they will direct a stated sum to be paid  waiting for this
determination  i am prevented from drawing bills at this time  as to
the money received from me  you will be pleased to replace with it the
two quarters  salary you had drawn before it came to hand  you will
have bills for a third quarter  which have been sent on some time
since 

several important political events have taken place here lately  the
evacuation of charleston  the sailing of the french fleet and the
army  the decision of the great cause between connecticut and
pennsylvania  in favor of the latter  the state of the army       all
of which i should enlarge upon  if this was not to be delivered by mr
jefferson  who will be able to inform you fully on these points and
many others  that you will deem important to a right knowledge of the
present state of this country  12 

i enclose a state of the trade between these states and the west
indies  as brought in by a committee of congress  and referred to me 
it may possibly afford you some hints  and will serve to show how
earnestly we wish to have this market opened to us 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i am much obliged by your information of your intended trip to
england  i heartily wish you a good journey  and a speedy return  and
request your kind care of a packet for mr hodgson 

i enclose two papers  that were read at different times by me to the
commissioners  they may serve to show  if you should have occasion 
what was urged on the part of america on certain points  or may help
to refresh your memory  i send you also another paper  which i once
read to you separately  it contains a proposition for improving the
law of nations  by prohibiting the plundering of unarmed and usefully
employed people  i rather wish than expect  that it will be adopted 
but i think it may be offered with a better grace by a country  that
is likely to suffer least and gain most by continuing the ancient
practice  which is our case  as the american ships  laden only with
the gross productions of the earth  cannot be so valuable as yours 
filled with sugars or with manufactures  it has not yet been
considered by my colleagues  but if you should think or find that it
might be acceptable on your side  i would try to get it inserted in
the general treaty  i think it will do honor to the nations that
establish it 

with great and sincere esteem  i am  sir  your most obedient and most
humble servant

      propositions relative to privateering  communicated to mr
                               oswald  

it is for the interest of humanity in general  that the occasions of
war  and the inducements to it should be diminished 

if rapine is abolished  one of the encouragements to war is taken
away  and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting 

the practice of robbing merchants on the high seas  a remnant of the
ancient piracy  though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular
persons  is far from being profitable to all engaged in it  or to the
nation that authorises it  in the beginning of a war  some rich ships 
not upon their guard  are surprised and taken  this encourages the
first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels  and many others to do
the same  but the enemy at the same time become more careful  arm
their merchant ships better  and render them not so easy to be taken 
they go also more under protection of convoys  thus while the
privateers to take them are multiplied  the vessels subject to be
taken  and the chances of profit  are diminished  so that many cruises
are made  wherein the expenses overgo the gains  and as is the case in
other lotteries  though particulars have got prizes  the mass of
adventurers are losers  the whole expense of fitting out all the
privateers  during a war  being much greater than the whole amount of
goods taken  then there is the national loss of all the labor of so
many men during the time they have been employed in robbing  who
besides spend what they get in riot  drunkenness  and debauchery  lose
their habits of industry  are rarely fit for any sober business after
a peace  and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and
housebreakers  even the undertakers  who have been fortunate  are by
sudden wealth led into expensive living  the habit of which continues
when the means of supporting it ceases  and finally ruins them  a just
punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many
honest innocent traders and their families  whose subsistence was
employed in serving the common interests of mankind 

should it be agreed and become a part of the law of nations  that the
cultivators of the earth are not to be molested or interrupted in
their peaceable and useful employment  the inhabitants of the sugar
islands would perhaps come under the protection of such a regulation 
which would be a great advantage to the nations who at present hold
those islands  since the cost of sugar to the consumer in those
nations  consists not merely in the price he pays for it by the pound 
but in the accumulated charge of all the taxes he pays in every war 
to fit out fleets and maintain troops for the defence of the islands
that raise the sugar  and the ships that bring it home  but the
expense of treasure is not all  a celebrated philosophical writer
remarks  that when he considered the wars made in africa  for
prisoners to raise sugars in america  the numbers slain in those wars 
the numbers that  being crowded in ships  perish in the
transportation  and the numbers that die under the severities of
slavery  he could scarce look on a morsel of sugar without conceiving
it spotted with human blood  if he had considered also the blood of
one another  which the white nations shed in fighting for those
islands  he would have imagined his sugar not as spotted only  but as
thoroughly dyed red  on these accounts i am persuaded  that the
subjects of the emperor of germany  and the empress of russia  who
have no sugar islands  consume sugar cheaper at vienna  and moscow 
with all the charge of transporting it after its arrival in europe 
than the citizens of london or of paris  and i sincerely believe  that
if france and england were to decide  by throwing dice  which should
have the whole of their sugar islands  the loser in the throw would be
the gainer  the future expense of defending them would be saved  the
sugars would be bought cheaper by all europe  if the inhabitants might
make it without interruption  and whoever imported the sugar  the same
revenue might be raised by duties at the custom houses of the nation
that consumed it  and  on the whole  i conceive it would be better for
the nations now possessing sugar colonies to give up their claim to
them  let them govern themselves  and put them under the protection of
all the powers of europe as neutral countries  open to the commerce of
all  the profits of the present monopolies being by no means
equivalent to the expense of maintaining them

mr adams  and your other colleagues  who are in paris  i therefore
pray you to invite these gentlemen to come out to versailles with you
on monday  before ten o clock in the morning  it will be well  also 
if you will bring your grandson  it will be necessary for much

object for which i ask this interview is very interesting to the

  my dearest sir 

i cannot but in the most earnest manner  and from recent
circumstances  press your going early to versailles tomorrow  and i
have considerable reason to think  that your appearance there will not
displease the person whom you address  i am of opinion  that it is
very likely that you will have the glory of having concluded the peace
by this visit  at least i am sure  if the deliberations of tomorrow
evening end unfavorably  that there is the strongest appearance of
war  if they end favorably  perhaps little difficulty may attend the
rest 

after all  the peace will have as much that is conceded in it  as
england can in any shape be made just now to relish  owing to the
stubborn demands  principally of spain  who would not  i believe  upon
any motive recede from her conquests  what i wrote about gibraltar
arrived after the subject  as i understand  was canvassed  and when it
of course must have appeared impolitic eagerly and immediately to
revive it 

you reproved me  or rather reproved a political scheme yesterday  of
which i have heard more said favorably by your friends at paris  than
by any persons whatever in london  but do you  my dear sir  make this
peace  and trust our common sense respecting another war  england 
said a man of sense to me the other day  will come out of the war like
a convalescent out of disease  and must be re established by some
physic and much regimen  i cannot easily tell in what shape a
bankruptcy would come upon england  and still less easily in what mode
and degree it would affect us  but if your confederacy mean to
bankrupt us now  i am sure we shall lose the great fear that would
deter us from another war  your allies  therefore  for policy and for
humanity   sake  will  i hope  stop short of this extremity 
especially as we should do some mischief to others  as well as to
ourselves 

i am  my dearest sir  your devoted  ever affectionate  and ever
obliged

late last night i received a note from count de vergennes  acquainting
me that it is very essential he should have a conference with us  and
requesting that i would inform my colleagues  he desires that we may
be with him before ten on monday morning  if it will suit you to call
here  we may go together in my carriage  we should be on the road by
eight o clock 

with great regard  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i have just received your letters of november 9th and december 3  
this is to inform you  and to request you to inform the congress  that
the preliminaries of peace between france  spain  and england  were
yesterday signed  and a cessation of arms agreed to by the ministers
of those powers  and by us in behalf of the united states  of which
act  so far as relates to us  i enclose a copy  i have not yet
obtained a copy of the preliminaries agreed to by the three crowns 
but hear  in general  that they are very advantageous to france and
spain  i shall be able  in a day or two  to write more fully and
perfectly  holland was not ready to sign preliminaries  but their
principal points are settled  mr laurens is absent at bath  and mr jay
in normandy  for their healths  but will both be here to assist in
forming the definitive treaty  i congratulate you and our country on
the happy prospects afforded us by the finishing so speedily this
glorious revolution  and am  with great esteem  sir

  sir 

it having been suspected  that i concurred in the appointment of your
grandson to the place of secretary to the american commission for
peace  at your instance   i think it right  thus unsolicited  to put
it in your power to correct the mistake 

your general character  the opinion i had long entertained of your
services to our country  and the friendly attention and aid with which
you had constantly favored me after my arrival in spain  impressed me
with a desire of manifesting both my esteem and attachment by stronger
evidence than professions  that desire extended my regard for you to
your grandson  he was then indeed a stranger to me  but the terms in
which you expressed to congress your opinion of his being qualified
for another place of equal importance  were so full and satisfactory 
as to leave me no room to doubt of his being qualified for the one
above mentioned  i was  therefore  happy to assure you  in one of the
first letters i afterwards wrote you from spain  that in case a
secretary to our commission for peace should become necessary  and the
appointment be left to us  i should take that opportunity of evincing
my regard for you  by nominating him  or words to that effect  what i
then wrote  was the spontaneous suggestion of my own mind 
unsolicited  and i believe unexpected by you 

when i came here on the business of that commission  i brought with me
the same intentions  and should always have considered myself engaged
by honor  as well as inclination  to fulfil them  unless i had found
myself mistaken in the opinion i had imbibed of that young gentleman  
character and qualifications  but that not being the case  i found
myself at liberty to indulge my wishes  and be as good as my word  for
i expressly declare  that your grandson is  in my opinion  qualified
for the place in question  and that  if he had not been  no
consideration would have prevailed upon me to propose  or join in his
appointment 

this explicit and unreserved statement of facts is due to you  to him 
and to justice  and you have my consent to make any use of it that you
may think proper 

  i have the honor to be  sir  with great respect 
                                                             john jay

  sir 

as i know you are on the point of making a tour to france  i cannot
omit warmly recommending to you to endeavor  during your stay at
paris  to gain as much as possible  the confidence and esteem of mr
franklin 

you will recollect  sir  what i said to you in our conversations  of
the high respect which all the king   ministry have for that minister 
you have witnessed the satisfaction with which we have learned the
glorious issue of this war for the united states of america  and how
fully we are persuaded  that it will be for the general interest of
the two states to form  as soon as possible  reciprocal connexions of
friendship and commerce  nothing  certainly  would be more agreeable
to us  than to learn by your letters  that you find the same
dispositions in mr franklin  and in that case it seems to me the
shortest way of accelerating these new connexions would be to take the
treaty between the congress and the states general for the basis  and
that mr franklin should communicate to us his ideas on the changes or
additions which he might think reciprocally useful in the treaty of
commerce  which congress might conclude with us 

we should eagerly and frankly reply to such overtures  and  as soon as
the changes thus agreed on shall have met the approbation of congress 
one of the persons commissioned by that body  then in europe  might 
in order to gain time  come here with full powers to conclude  leaving
on both sides the most particular stipulations for the negotiations of
the ministers which those states shall  in the sequel  send to reside
with each other 

i shall finish  sir  with hoping that you may happily terminate the
visits you have proposed to make to the different parts of france  and
it is with sentiments of the most distinguished respect  that

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i but this moment hear of this opportunity  by which i can only send
you a line to acquaint you  that i have concluded the treaty with
sweden  which was signed on wednesday last  you will have a copy by
the first good opportunity  it differs very little from the plan sent
me  in nothing material  13  the english court is in confusion by
another change of ministry  lord shelburne and his friends having
resigned  but it is not yet certainly known who will succeed  though
lord north and mr fox are talked of as two  they being reconciled   i
cannot add  but that i am  with great esteem  sir     

                                                             franklin 

        the change in the ministry is not supposed of any importance
respecting our definitive treaty  which must conform to the
preliminaries  but we shall see

  my dear friend 

it is a long while since i have heard from you  or indeed since i
wrote to you  i heartily congratulate you on those pacific events 
which have already happened  and i wish to see all other final steps
of conciliation succeed speedily  i send you copies of two papers 
which i have already communicated to mr laurens  the one called
 conciliatory propositions  in march  1783   the other  a sketch of a
provisional treaty of commerce for opening the ports between great
britain and the united states of america without delay   to each of
which is prefixed a short state of the argument on each head 

as for the news of this country  you have doubtless heard  that lord
shelburne   administration has for some time been considered as at an
end  although no other has been as yet substituted in the place of it 
it was understood yesterday  and i believe with good foundation  that
what is now called the portland party have been applied to  and they
are now considered as the party most likely to succeed  as far as my
wishes go  such an event would be most satisfactory to me  i have
known the duke of portland for many years  and by experience i know

                                                              hartley 

                                                   

                conciliatory propositions  march  1783  

terms of peace having been agreed upon between great britain and
france  on the 20th of january  1783  there need not be any further
delay in proceeding to conclude the proposed treaty between great
britain and the united states of america  upon the basis of the
provisional articles of the 30th of november  1782 

it is to be observed  that none of the articles of the provisional
treaty are to take effect  until the conclusion of the definitive
treaty with america  at which time likewise all places in the american
states  in possession of the british arms  are to be evacuated  and
the british army withdrawn from the united states  by article 7   if
therefore it should be wished on the part of great britain to bring
forward the fifth article respecting the loyalists  before the
conclusion of the definitive treaty with america  the bayonet should
be withdrawn from the american breast  by the voluntary removal of the
british troops with all convenient despatch  this condition of the
removal of the troops is likewise necessary  before any provisional
terms of commerce with america can take place 

by the 6th article of the provisional treaty  all future confiscations
in america are precluded  although the prosecutions at present
subsisting are not to be stopped before the definitive treaty  but if
the substantial pledge of returning amity on the part of great
britain  viz  the removal of the troops should be voluntarily
anticipated  it would be but reasonable that all prosecutions should
be immediately abated on the part of america  and to facilitate the
removal of the troops  the loyalists may be permitted to remain in
safety and unmolested   if they choose to remain  from the period of
removing the troops  until twelve months after the definitive treaty 

there is another article of the provisional treaty  the delay of which
is much to be lamented  viz  the mutual release of prisoners of war on
both sides  as this is an article of reciprocity  both sides from
principles of humanity are equally interested to bring it forward into
effect speedily  that those unhappy captives may not alone suffer the
miseries of war in the time of peace 

upon these considerations  the following supplemental terms of a
treaty between great britain and the united states are proposed 

1  that the british troops shall be withdrawn with all convenient
speed 

2  that the commissioners on both sides do proceed to the conclusion
of the definitive treaty 

3  that the commissioners do speedily negotiate a provisional
convention of commerce  hereunto annexed  to take place immediately 
the terms of this temporary convention  not to be pleaded on either
side in the negotiation of final and perpetual treaty of commerce 
between great britain and the united states 

4  that the commissioners do negotiate a perpetual treaty of commerce 

5  that all prosecutions of the loyalists in america be immediately
abated  and that they be permitted to remain until twelve months after
the definitive treaty  unmolested in their endeavors to obtain
restitution of their estates 

6  that all prisoners on both sides be immediately released 

7  that intercourse of amity and commerce do immediately take place
between great britain and the united states of america 

                                                   

             sketch of a provisional treaty of commerce  

as soon as preliminaries of peace are signed with any independent
states  such as spain  france  and holland  the course of mutual
commerce emerges upon the same terms and conditions as were existing
antecedent to the war  the new duties imposed during the war excepted 
the case between great britain and america is different  because
america  from a dependent nation before the war  emerges an
independent nation after the war  the basis  therefore  of a
provisional treaty between great britain and the united states would
be simply to arrange such points as would emerge after the war 
impracticable and discordant to the newly established independence of
the american states  and to leave all others  as much as possible 
untouched  for instance  that all instrumental regulations  such as
papers  bonds  certificates  oaths  and all other documents should be 
between great britain and the united states  upon the same footing 
and no other than as between great britain and any other independent
nation  but that all duties  drawbacks  bounties  rights  privileges 
and all pecuniary considerations  should emerge into action and effect
as before  i say emerge as before  not stipulated for any fixed term 
because i am speaking of a provisional  treaty   not of a provisional
 bill  of commerce  for a specified period  by this means  all
difficulties  which otherwise would be accumulated  and obstruct a
temporary and provisional act are avoided  in limine   the ports will
be immediately opened  upon specified and known conditions  if the
legislature of either country thinks proper to introduce on its own
part any new conditions or regulations  even previous to the intended
treaty of commerce  that will not shut the ports again generally but
only operate  pro tanto  according to the case  on which side soever
any novel condition should arise  the other will likewise be at
liberty to make any corresponding regulations as between independent
nations  the great object is to open the ports between great britain
and the united states  immediately on the signature of preliminaries
of peace  as between france and great britain  by the proposition
above stated  great britain and france  and great britain and the
united states respectively  on the subject of intercourse of commerce 
would emerge again after the war into situations relatively similar to
their situation before the war 

the crown of great britain is enabled by the conciliatory act of 1782
to repeal  annul  make void  or suspend  for any time or times  the
operation and effect of any act of parliament  or any clause 
provision  matter  or thing therein contained  relating to the
colonies or plantations now become the united states of america  and 
therefore  the crown is not only competent to conclude  but likewise
to carry into effect any provisional treaty of commerce with america 
the first foundation must be laid in the total repeal of the
prohibitory act of december  1775  not only as prohibiting commerce
between great britain and the united states  but as the corner stone
of the war  by giving up universally all american property at sea to
military plunder  without any redress to be obtained by law in any
british court of admiralty  after this  all obstructions from the act
of navigation and other acts regulating the commerce of the states of
america  formerly dependent upon great britain   may be removed 
instructions may be sent to the commissioners of the customs to
dispense with bonds  certificates      which by the old laws are
required to be discharged or attested by supposed governors  naval or
customhouse officers in america  the questions of drawbacks  bounties 
    after opening the ports  may remain free points of discussion and
regulation  as between states having no commercial treaty subsisting
between them  as the crown is competent to open an intercourse of
commerce with america by treaty  this mode is preferable to any act of
parliament  which may be only a jealous and suspicious convention  ex
parte   this mode by treaty avoids the accumulated difficulties  which
might otherwise obstruct the first opening of the ports by act of
parliament  and above all  it secures an alternate binding part of the
bargain  which no act of parliament can do 

breviate of the treaty  viz  provisional for intercourse and commerce
between great britain and the united states of america 

1  that all ports shall be mutually open for intercourse and commerce 

2  and therefore the king of great britain agrees to the repeal of the
prohibitory acts  viz  16 geo  3  chap  5      the king of great
britain likewise agrees by instructions  according to the laws of
great britain  to his commissioners of customs and other officers  to
remove all obstructions to american ships either entering inwards or
clearing outwards  which may arise from any acts of parliament
heretofore regulating the commerce of the american states  under the
description of british colonies or plantations  so as to accommodate
every circumstance to the reception of their ships  as the ships of
independent states 

3  all duties  drawbacks  bounties  rights  privileges  and all other
money considerations shall remain  respecting the united states of
america  upon the same footing as they now remain respecting the
province of nova scotia in america  or as if the aforesaid states had
remained dependent upon great britain  all this subject to regulations
or alterations by any future acts of the parliament of great britain 

4  on the part of the states of america  it is agreed that all laws
prohibiting the commerce of great britain shall be repealed 

5  agreed upon the same part  that all ships  and merchandise of the
british dominions shall be admitted upon the same terms as before the
war  except any imposts laid during the war  all this subject to
future regulations or alterations by the legislatures of the american
states respectively 

6  the principles and spirit of this treaty to be supported on either
side by any necessary supplemental arrangements  no tacit compliance
on the part of america in any subordinate points to be argued at any
time hereafter to the prejudice of their independence

  dear sir 

i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me 
requesting a recommendation to america  of mr joshua grigby  i have
accordingly written one  and having an opportunity the other day  i
sent it under cover to mr benjamin vaughan  the general proclamations
you wished for suspending  or rather putting an end to hostilities 
are now published  so that your  heart is at rest   and mine with it 
you may depend on my joining my hearty endeavors with yours  in
 cultivating conciliatory principles between our two countries   and i
may venture to assure you  that if your bill for a provisional
establishment of the commerce had passed as at first proposed  a
stipulation on our part in the definitive treaty  to allow reciprocal
and equal advantages and privileges to your subjects  would have been
readily agreed to 

  with great and sincere esteem  i am ever

                                       philadelphia  march 26th  1783 

  sir 

i need hardly tell you  that the intelligence brought by the
washington diffused a general pleasure  we had long been in suspense
with respect to the negotiations  and had received no other lights on
that subject  than those the speech of his britannic majesty and mr
townshend   letters threw upon it  these were by no means sufficient
to dissipate all our apprehensions 

the terms you have obtained for us comprise most of the objects we
wish for  i am sorry  however  that you found it necessary to act with
reserve  and to conceal your measures from the court of france  i am
fearful that you will not be able to produce such facts  as will
justify this conduct to the world  or free us from the charge of
ingratitude to a friend  who has treated us not only justly but
generously 

but this is a disagreeable subject  and i refer you for my sentiments 
and those of congress  to my letter  in answer to the joint letter
from our ministers  i am sorry that the commercial article is stricken
out  it would have been very important to us to have got footing at
least in the british west indies  as a means of compelling france to
pursue her true interest and ours  by opening her ports also to us 

we have just learned by a vessel from cadiz  that the preliminary
articles for a general peace were signed the 20th  the abstract of the
treaty sent me by the marquis de lafayette  does the highest honor to
the moderation and wisdom of france  never has she terminated a war
with more glory  and in gaining nothing but that trophy of victory 
tobago  she has established a character  which confirms her friends 
disarms her enemies  and obtains a reputation that is of more value
than any territorial acquisitions she could make 

we have been in great distress with respect to our army  pains were
taken to inflame their minds  and make them uneasy at the idea of a
peace  which left them without support  inflammatory papers were
dispersed in camp  calling them together to determine upon some mad
action  the general interposed  postponed the meeting to a future day 
on which he met them  and made them an address  that will do him more
honor than his victories  after which they passed several resolves 
becoming a patriot army  congress are seriously engaged in endeavoring
to do them justice  i am in great hopes  that we shall shortly be
brought back to such a situation  as to be enabled to enjoy the
blessings you have laid the foundation of 

i received from mr franklin the papers relative to the portuguese
vessel  which i have caused to be laid before the court of appeals 
where the cause is now depending  the cargo having been condemned  and
the yacht acquitted at boston  i doubt not but full justice will be
done to the proprietors on the rehearing  you know so much of our
constitution as to see  that it is impossible to interfere further in
these matters  than by putting the evidence in a proper train to be
examined  i have had the proceedings in the case of the brig
providentia transmitted to me from boston  with a full state of the
evidence  which i have examined  the cargo is condemned and the vessel
acquitted  an allowance for freight having been made by the court  the
evidence does not admit a doubt of the justice of this decree  should
the court of denmark not be satisfied with this account  i will cause
a copy of the proceedings to be transmitted to you for their
satisfaction  i hope this mark of attention to them will induce them
to acknowledge the injustice they have done us  in the detention of
our prizes  this object should not be lost sight of 

i thank you for your present of      auberteuil   essay  and shall
dispose of the copies he has sent in the way you recommend  i could
hardly have believed it possible  that so many errors and falsehoods 
that would shock the strongest faith on this side of the water  could
be received as orthodox on the other 

i remit bills for the salaries of our ministers  it is impossible 
that i can adjust their accounts here  you must settle with them  and
they repay you out of the drafts i have made in their favor when they
have been overpaid  congress have  in pursuance of your sentiment  in
your letter of october  passed the enclosed resolution  14  so that
on the quarter   salary due in april  there will be a deduction of all
you gained by the course of exchange  and the payments will be reduced
to par  at which rate they will always be paid in future  this
deduction amounts on your salary to eight thousand three hundred and
thirtysix livres  as will appear from the account that will be stated
by mr morris  i shall pay your bills into the hands of mr robert
morris  whom you have constituted your agent  the bills for the other
gentlemen  who may not be with you  are committed to your care  as the
bills are drawn in their favor  they can only be paid on their
endorsement 

congress will  i believe  agree very reluctantly to let you quit their
service  the subject  together with mr adams   and mr laurens  
resignation  is under the consideration of a committee  if they report
before this vessel sails  you shall know their determination 

on the arrival of the triumph from cadiz  which brought orders for
recalling the cruisers of his britannic majesty  congress passed the
enclosed resolution  which i transmitted with the intelligence we had
received to carleton and digby  i sent my secretary with my letters 
and expect him back this evening  i am anxious to know how the first
messenger of peace has been received by them  as well as to discover
through him what steps they propose to take for the evacuation 

i ought to thank you for your journal before i conclude  the perusal
of it afforded me great pleasure  i must pray you to continue it  i
much wish to have every step  which led to so interesting an event as
the treaty  which established our independence  and though both mr jay
and mr adams are minute in their journals  for which i am much obliged
to them  yet new light may be thrown on the subject by you  who 
having been longer acquainted with the courts both of london and
versailles  have the means of more information relative to their
principles and measures 

  i have the honor to be  sir     

                                                 robert    livingston

  right noble  high  mighty  most honorable lords 

since  by the preliminary articles of peace  concluded lately between
the high belligerent powers  the illustrious united states of north
america have been acknowledged free  sovereign  and independent  and
now since european powers are courting in rivalry the friendship of
your high mightinesses 

we  impressed with the most lively sensations on the illustrious
event  the wonder of this  and the most remote future ages  and
desirous fully to testify the part which we take therein  do hereby
offer your high mightinesses our service and attachment to the cause 

and in the most sincere disposition of heart  we take the honor to
wish  so as from omnipotent providence we do pray  that the most
illustrious republic of the united states of america may  during the
remotest centuries  enjoy all imaginable advantages to be derived from
that sovereignty  which they gained by prudence and courage 

that  by the wisdom and active patriotism of your illustrious
congress  it may forever flourish and increase  and that the high and
mighty regents of those free united states may  with ease and in
abundance  enjoy all manner of temporal happiness  and at the same
time we most obsequiously recommend our city to a perpetual friendly
intelligence  and her trade and navigation in matters reciprocally
advantageous to your favor and countenance 

in order to show that such mutual commerce with the merchant houses of
this place may undoubtedly be of common benefit  your high
mightinesses will be pleased to give us leave to mark out some
advantages of this trading city 

here reigns a free unrestrained republican commerce  charged with but
few duties 

hamburg   situation upon the river elbe is  as if it were in the
centre of the baltic and the north sea  and as canals are cut from the
river through the city  goods may be brought in ships to the magazines
in town  and from thence again to all parts of the world 

hamburg carries on its trade with economy  it is the mart of goods of
all countries  where they can be purchased not only of good quality 
but sometimes cheaper than at first hand 

here linen  woollen goods  calicoes  glass  copper and all other
numerous produce of manufactured wares of the whole german empire  are
brought in by portuguese  spaniards  the english  dutch  french  and
other nations  and from hence further transported  in exchange
whereof  considerable quantities of north american goods  much wanted
in germany  may be taken 

   penet  who in your country is honored with several offices  has
sojourned here for some time  and with all who had the honor of his
acquaintance  borne the character of an intelligent  skilful  and for
reciprocally advantageous commerce  a well disposed and zealous man 
will certainly have the complaisance to give your high mightinesses
further explanation of the advantages of this trading place  which we
have but briefly touched upon 

we now intercessionally and most obsequiously request your high
mightinesses to favor and countenance the trade of our merchants  and
to suffer them to enjoy all such rights and liberties as you allow to
merchants of nations in amity  which in gratitude and with zeal we
will in our place endeavor to retribute  not doubting that such mutual
intercourse may be effected  since a good beginning thereof is already
made on both sides  by the friendly reception of the vessels that have
arrived in either country 

in further testimony of our most attentive obsequiousness and sincere
attachment  we have deputed our citizen  john abraham de boor  who is
charged with the concerns of a considerable merchant house  which 
like several other merchant houses of good report and solidity in this
city  is desirous of entering with merchants of your country into
reciprocal commerce  he is to have the honor to present to your high
mightinesses this our most obsequious missive  wherefore we most
earnestly recommend him to your favorable reception  he has it from us
in express charge  most respectfully to give your high mightinesses 
if required  such upright and accurate accounts of our situation and
constitutions  as may be depended upon  and at the same time in person
to testify the assurance of the most perfect respect and attachment 
with which attentively we remain  right noble  high  mighty  and most
honorable lords  your most obsequious and devoted burgomaster and
senate of the imperial free city of hamburg 

given under our city seal  the 29th of march  1783

  my dear friend 

i send you a paper entitled  supplemental treaty   the substance of
which i sent you some time ago  as i read it in part of a speech in
the house of commons  i have given a copy of it to mr     as the
grounds upon which my friend  the duke of portland  would have wished
that any administration  in which he might have taken a part  should
have treated with the american ministers  all negotiations for the
formation of a ministry in concert with the duke of portland are at an
end 

the tenth article  which is supposed to be referred to the definitive
treaty  is a renewal of the same proposition  which i moved in
parliament some years ago  viz  on the 9th of april  1778  i see
nothing inconsistent with that proposition  either in the declaration
of independence or in the treaty with france  let it therefore
remain  and emerge after the war  as a point untouched by the war  i
assure you my consent should not be wanting to extend this principle
between all the nations upon earth  i know full well  that those
nations to which you and i are bound by birth and consanguinity  would
reap the earliest fruits from it   owing no man hate  and envying no
man   happiness   i should rejoice in the lot of my own country  and
on her part say to america   nos duo turba sumus   i send you 
likewise  enclosed with this  some sentiments respecting the
principles of some late negotiations  drawn up in the shape of
parliamentary motions by my brother  who joins with me in the
sincerest good wishes to you for health and happiness  and for the
peace of our respective countries  and of mankind 

  your ever affectionate 

                                                              hartley 

                                                   

          supplemental treaty between great britain and the
                    united states of north america  

1  that the british troops be withdrawn from the united states with
all convenient speed 

2  that all further prosecutions of loyalists in america be
immediately abated  and that they be permitted to remain until twelve
months after the definitive treaty with america in safety and
unmolested  in their endeavors to obtain restitution of their estates 

3  that all ports shall be mutually opened for intercourse and
commerce  between great britain and the united states 

4  agreed on the part of great britain  that all prohibitory acts
shall be repealed  and that all obstructions to american ships  either
entering inwards or clearing outwards  shall be removed  which may
arise from any acts of parliament  heretofore regulating the commerce
of the american states  under the description of british colonies and
plantations  so as to accommodate every circumstance to the reception
of their ships  as the ships of independent states 

5  agreed on the part of great britain  that all duties  rights 
privileges  and all pecuniary considerations shall remain  respecting
the united states of america  upon the same footing as they now remain
respecting the province of nova scotia  or as if the said states had
remained dependent upon great britain  all this subject to regulations
and alterations by any future acts of the parliament of great britain 

6  on the part of the american states it is agreed  that all laws
prohibiting commerce with great britain shall be repealed 

7  agreed on the part of the american states  that all ships and
merchandise of the british dominions shall be admitted upon the same
terms as before the war  all this subject to future regulations or
alterations by the legislatures of the american states respectively 

8  that all prisoners on both sides be immediately released 

9  the spirit and principles of this treaty to be supported on either
side by any necessary supplemental arrangements  no tacit compliance
on the part of the american states in any subordinate points to be
urged at any time hereafter in derogation of their independence 

                                                   

     separate article to be referred to the definitive treaty  

10  neither shall the independence of the united states be construed
any further than as independence  absolute and unlimited in matters of
government  as well as commerce  not into alienation  and therefore
the subjects of his britannic majesty and the citizens of the united
states shall mutually be considered as natural born subjects  and
enjoy all rights and privileges as such in the respective dominions
and territories  in the manner heretofore accustomed 

                                                   

        paper mentioned in the close of mr hartley   letter  

1  that it is the opinion of this house  that whenever great britain
thought proper to acknowledge the independence of america  the mode of
putting it into effect most honorably for this country  would have
been  to have made the declaration of independence previous to the
commencement of any treaty with any other power 

2  that a deviation from that line of conduct  has the effect of
appearing to grant the independence of america solely to the demands
of the house of bourbon  and not  as was the real state of the case 
from a change in the sentiments of this country  as to the object and
continuance of the american war 

3  that when this house  by its vote against the further prosecution
of offensive war in america  had given up the point of contest  and
adopted a conciliatory disposition  the pursuing those principles by
an immediate and liberal negotiation upon the basis of independence 
at the same time expressing a readiness to conclude a general peace
with the allies of america upon honorable terms  would have been the
most likely way to promote a mutual and beneficial intercourse between
the two countries  to establish peace upon a firm foundation  and
would have prevented the house of bourbon from having a right to claim
any further obligations from america  as the assertors of their
independence 

4  that the minister  who advised the late negotiations for peace  has
neglected to make use of those advantages  which the determination of
the house put him in possession of  that  by his delay in authorising
persons properly to negotiate with the american commissioners  he has
shown a reluctance to acting upon the liberal principles of granting
independence to america  as the determination of great britain upon
mature consideration of the question  and has by such methods given
advantage to the enemies of this country to promote and confirm that
commerce and connexion between the united states of america and
themselves  which during the contest have been turned from their
natural channel with this country  and which this peace so concluded
has not yet contributed to restore

  sir 

the imminent danger to which the vessels of your nation were exposed 
which sailed in march last from marseilles  and which owed their
safety to the god of the seas alone  emboldens me to call your
attention to this point 

some secret enemies   whom i know  having giving information to this
regency of their departure  nine armed ships immediately sailed to
wait for them at cape palos  it is to be presumed that the americans
had passed the straits 

algiers has many ships  and the politics of certain european powers do
not restrain them from paying tribute to enjoy peace  they make use of
these human harpies as a terror to the belligerent nations  whose
commerce they chain to the car of algerine piracy  we saw an example
of this  when his imperial majesty  to protect his flag  made use of
the firman of the sublime porte  it was attacked  and five prizes were
brought into this port in 1781  four of which with ballast were
restored in february  1782  at the claim of a capapigi bashaw of the
porte  and of    timone  the imperial agent  who was expelled  and
whose correspondent i am  having been his secretary on this occasion 
and having revealed to his highness  prince kaunitz rietberg  minister
at the court of vienna  horrors and crimes which would have remained
unpunished but for my pen 

humanity alone  sir  has engaged me to give you this advice  i request
you will be pleased to keep it secret  your prudence will effect what
may be necessary on this occasion 

i have the honor to offer you every information respecting this port 
and flatter myself that i shall succeed therein  i think to depart
from this in may or june next for marseilles  and to leave these
barbarian pirates 

  i have the honor to be

  my lord 

i have the honor to address to your eminent highness the medal  which
i have lately had struck  it is a homage of gratitude  my lord  which
is due to the interest you have taken in our cause  and we no less owe
it to your virtues  and to your eminent highness   wise administration
of government 

permit me  my lord  to demand your protection for such of our citizens
as circumstances may lead to your ports  i hope that your eminent
highness will be pleased to grant it to them  and kindly receive the
assurances of the profound respect with which i am  my lord

  sir 

monsieur de walterstorff has communicated to me a letter from your
excellency  which affords me great pleasure  as it expresses in clear
and strong terms the good disposition of your court 16  to form
connexions of friendship and commerce with the united states of
america  i am confident that the same good disposition will be found
in the congress  and having acquainted that respectable body with the
purport of your letter  i expect a commission will soon be sent 
appointing some person in europe to enter into a treaty with his
majesty the king of denmark for the purpose desired 

in the meantime  to prepare and forward the business as much as may
be  i send  for your excellency   consideration  such a sketch as you
mention  formed on the basis of our treaty with holland  on which i
shall be glad to receive your excellency   sentiments  and i hope
that this transaction when completed  may be the means of producing
and securing a long and happy friendship between our two nations 

to smooth the way for obtaining this desirable end  as well as to
comply with my duty  it becomes necessary for me on this occasion to
mention to your excellency the affair of our three prizes  which 
having during the war entered bergen as a neutral and friendly port 
where they might repair the damages they had suffered  and procure
provisions  were  by an order of your predecessor in the office you so
honorably fill  violently seized and delivered to our enemies  i am
inclined to think it was a hasty act  procured by the importunities
and misrepresentations of the british minister  and that your
government could not  on reflection  approve of it  but the injury was
done  and i flatter myself your excellency will think with me  that it
ought to be repaired  the means and manner i beg leave to recommend to
your consideration  and am  with great respect  sir

  sir 

you complain sometimes of not hearing from us  it is now near three
months since any of us have heard from america  i think our last
letters came with general de rochambeau  there is now a project under
consideration for establishing monthly packet boats between france and
new york  which i hope will be carried into execution  our
correspondence then may be more regular and frequent 

i send herewith another copy of the treaty concluded with sweden  i
hope  however  that you will have received the former  and that the
ratification is forwarded  the king  as the ambassador informs me  is
now employed in examining the duties payable in his ports  with a view
of lowering them in favor of america  and thereby encouraging and
facilitating our mutual commerce 

   de walterstorff  chamberlain of the king of denmark  formerly chief
justice of the danish west india islands  was last year at paris 
where i had some acquaintance with him  and he is now returned hither 
the newspapers have mentioned him as intended to be sent minister from
his court to congress  but he tells me no such appointment has yet
been made  he assures me  however  that the king has a strong desire
to have a treaty of friendship and commerce with the united states 
and he has communicated to me a letter  which he received from   
rosencrone  the minister for foreign affairs  expressing that
disposition  i enclose a copy of the letter  and if congress shall
approve of entering into such a treaty with the king of denmark  of
which i told    de walterstorff i made no doubt  they will send to me 
or whom else they shall think proper  the necessary instructions and
powers for that purpose  in the meantime  to keep the business in
train  i have sent to that minister for his consideration  a
translation of the plan   mutatis mutandis   which i received from
congress for a treaty with sweden  accompanied by a letter  of which
likewise i enclose a copy  i think it would be well to make it one of
the instructions to whoever is commissioned for the treaty  that he
previously procure satisfaction for the prizes mentioned in my letter 

the definitive treaties have met with great delays  partly by the
tardiness of the dutch  but principally from the distractions in the
court of england  where for six or seven weeks there was properly no
ministry  nor any business effected  they have at last settled a
ministry  but of such a composition as does not promise to be lasting 
the papers will inform you who they are  it is now said  that mr
oswald  who signed the preliminaries  is not to return here  but that
mr david hartley comes in his stead to settle the definitive  a
congress is also talked of  and that some use is to be made therein of
the mediation formerly proposed of the imperial courts  mr hartley is
an old friend of mine  and a strong lover of peace  so that i hope we
shall not have much difficult discussion with him  but i could have
been content to have finished with mr oswald  whom we always found
very reasonable 

mr laurens  having left bath  mended in his health  is daily expected
at paris  where messieurs jay and adams still continue  mr jefferson
has not yet arrived  nor the romulus  in which ship i am told he was
to have taken his passage  i have been the more impatient of this
delay  from the expectation given me of full letters by him  it is
extraordinary  that we should be so long without any arrivals from
america in any part of europe  we have as yet heard nothing of the
reception of the preliminary articles in america  though it is now
nearly five months since they were signed  barney  indeed  did not get
away from hence before the middle of january  but copies went by other
ships long before him  he waited some time for the money he carried 
and afterwards was detained by violent contrary winds  he had a
passport from england  and i hope arrived safe  though we have been in
some pain for him  on account of a storm soon after he sailed 

the english merchants have shown great eagerness to reassume their
commerce with america  but apprehending that our laws prohibiting that
commerce  would not be repealed till england had set the example by
repealing theirs  a number of vessels they had loaded with goods  have
been detained in port  while the parliament have been debating on the
repealing bill  which has been altered two or three times  and is not
agreed upon yet  it was at first proposed to give us equal privileges
in trade with their own subjects  repealing thereby with respect to
us  so much of their navigation act  as regards foreign nations  but
that plan seems to be laid aside  and what will finally be done in the
affair is uncertain  there is not a port in france  and few in europe 
from which i have not received several applications of persons
desiring to be appointed consuls for america  they generally offer to
execute the office for the honor of it  without salary  i suppose the
congress will wait to see what course commerce will take  and in what
places it will fix itself  in order to find where consuls will be
necessary  before any appointments are made  and perhaps it will then
be thought best to send some of our own people  if they are not
allowed to trade  there must be a great expense for salaries  if they
may trade  and are americans  the fortunes they make will mostly
settle in our own country at last  the agreement i was to make here
respecting consuls  has not yet been concluded  the article of trading
is important  i think it would be well to reconsider it 

i have caused to be struck here the medal  which i formerly mentioned
to you  the design of which you seemed to approve  i enclose one of
them in silver  for the president of congress  and one in copper for
yourself  the impression on copper is thought to appear best  and you
will soon receive a number for the members  i have presented one to
the king  and another to the queen  both in gold  and one in silver to
each of the ministers  as a monumental acknowledgment  which may go
down to future ages  of the obligations we are under to this nation 
it is mighty well received  and gives general pleasure  if the
congress approve of it  as i hope they will  i may add something on
the die  for those to be struck hereafter  to show that it was done by
their order  which i could not venture to do till i had authority for
it 

a multitude of people are continually applying to me personally  and
by letters  for information respecting the means of transporting
themselves  families  and fortunes to america  i give no encouragement
to any of the king   subjects  as i think it would not be right in me
to do it  without their sovereign   approbation  and  indeed  few
offer from france but persons of irregular conduct and desperate
circumstances  whom we had better be without  but i think there will
be great emigrations from england  ireland  and germany  there is a
great contest among the ports  which of them shall be of those to be
declared  free  for the  american trade   many applications are made
to me to interest myself in the behalf of all of them  but having no
instructions on that head  and thinking it a matter more properly
belonging to the consul  i have done nothing in it 

i have continued to send you the english papers  you will often see
falsehoods in them respecting what i say and do      you know those
papers too well to make any contradiction of such stuff necessary from
me 

mr barclay is often ill  and i am afraid the settlement of our
accounts will be  in his hands  a long operation  i shall be impatient
at being detained here on that score  after the arrival of my
successor  would it not be well to join mr ridley with mr barclay for
that service  he resides in paris  and seems active in business  i
know not indeed whether he would undertake it  but wish he may 

the finances here are embarrassed  and a new loan is proposed by way
of lottery  in which it is said by some calculators  the king will pay
at the rate of seven per cent  i mention this to furnish you with a
fresh convincing proof against cavillers of the king   generosity
towards us  in lending us six millions this year at five per cent  and
of his concern for our credit  in saving by that sum the honor of mr
morris   bills  while those drawn by his own officers abroad have
their payment suspended for a year after they become due  you have
been told that france might help us more liberally if she would  this
last transaction is a demonstration of the contrary 

please to show these last paragraphs to mr morris  to whom i cannot
now write  the notice of this ship being short  but it is less
necessary  as mr grand writes him fully 

  with great esteem

although it is unnecessary for me to introduce to your acquaintance a
gentlemen so well known to you as mr hartley  who will have the honor
of delivering to you this letter  yet it may be proper for me to
inform you  that he has the full and entire confidence of his
majesty   ministers upon the subject of his mission 

permit me  sir  to take this opportunity of assuring you how happy i
should esteem myself  if it were to prove my lot to be the instrument
of completing a real and substantial reconciliation between two
countries  formed by nature to be in a state of friendship one with
the other  and thereby to put the finishing hand to a building  in
laying the first stone of which i may fairly boast that i had some
share

the honor to be the bearer of this  i have not the satisfaction to be
personally acquainted with this gentleman  but am much solicited by
some of my particular friends  to whom his merits and character are
known  to afford him this introduction to you  he is  i understand  a
great traveller  and his view in going to america is merely to see the
country and its great men  i pray you will show him every civility 
and afford him that counsel  which as a stranger he may stand in need
of

i have received the two letters of yesterday and today  which you have
done me the honor to write to me  and a copy of the three articles
discussed between the commissioners of the united states and mr
hartley  you are aware that i shall want a sufficient time to examine
them  before submitting to you the observations  which may relate to
our reciprocal interests  receive  in the meantime  my sincere thanks
for this communication 

i hope to have the honor of seeing you tomorrow at versailles  i trust
you will be able to be present with the foreign ministers  it is
observed  that the commissioners from the united states rarely show
themselves here  and inferences are drawn from it  which i am sure
their constituents would disavow  if they had a knowledge of them

it was my intention to pay my devoirs at versailles tomorrow  i thank
your excellency  nevertheless  for your kind admonition  i omitted
two of the last three days from a mistaken apprehension  that being
holidays there would be no court  mr laurens and mr jay are both
invalids  and since my last severe fit of the gout  my legs have
continued so weak  that i am hardly able to keep pace with the
ministers who walk fast  especially in going up and down stairs

strength  there is none of respect in  sir  your excellency   most

  dear friend 

i send you enclosed the copies you desired of the papers i read to you
yesterday  17  i should be happy if i could see  before i die  the
proposed improvement of the law of nations established  the miseries
of mankind would be diminished by it  and the happiness of millions
secured and promoted  if the practice of privateering could be
profitable to any civilized nation  it might be so to us americans 
since we are so situated on the globe  as that the rich commerce of
europe with the west indies  consisting of manufactures  sugars     
is obliged to pass before our doors  which enables us to make short
and cheap cruises  while our own commerce is in such bulky  low priced
articles as that ten of our ships taken by you are not equal in value
to one of yours  and you must come far from home at a great expense to
look for them  i hope therefore that this proposition  if made by us 
will appear in its true light  as having humanity only for its motive 
i do not wish to see a new barbary rising in america  and our long
extended coast occupied by piratical states  i fear lest our
privateering success in the two last wars  should already have given
our people too strong a relish for that most mischievous kind of
gaming  mixed blood  and if a stop is not now put to the practice 
mankind may hereafter be more plagued with american corsairs  than
they have been and are with the turkish  try  my friend  what you can
do  in procuring for your nation the glory of being  though the
greatest naval power  the first who voluntarily relinquished the
advantage that power seems to give them  of plundering others  and
thereby impeding the mutual communications among men of the gifts of
god  and rendering miserable multitudes of merchants and their
families  artizans  and cultivators of the earth  the most peaceable
and innocent part of the human species 

with great esteem and affection  i am ever  my dear friend  yours most
sincerely

  dear sir 

we have yet had no information from you subsequent to the signature of
preliminary articles by france  spain  and great britain  though we
have seen a declaration for the cessation of hostilities signed by
you  mr adams  and mr jay 

we grow every day more anxious for the definitive treaty  since we
have as yet discovered no inclination in the enemy to evacuate their
ports  and in sending off the slaves  they have directly infringed the
provisional treaty  though we on our part have paid the strictest
regard to it  this will be more fully explained by the enclosed copy
of a letter from general washington  containing a relation of what
passed between him and general carleton at a late interview  let me
again entreat  that no doubt may be left in the treaty relative to the
time and manner of evacuating their ports here  without more precision
and accuracy in this than we find in the provisional articles  we
shall soon be involved in new disputes with great britain 

our finances are still greatly embarrassed  you may in part see our
distress  and the means congress are using to relieve themselves  by
the enclosed pamphlet  which i wish you and your colleagues to read 
but not to publish 

the enclosed resolution imposes a new task upon you  i hope you will
find no great difficulty in procuring the small augmentation to the
loan which it requires  be assured that it is extremely necessary to
set us down in peace 

none of the states  though frequently called upon  have sent me the
estimates of their losses by the ravages of the british  except
connecticut and rhode island  and their accounts are extremely
imperfect  such as they are i enclose them  for my own part  i have no
great expectation that any compensation for these losses will be
procured  however  if possible it should be attempted  commissioners
might be appointed to ascertain them here 

great part of the prisoners are on their way to new york  and the
whole will be sent in a few days  they will amount to about six
thousand men 

our ports begin to be crowded with vessels  there is reason to fear
that a superabundance of foreign articles will  in the end  produce as
much distress as the want of them has heretofore occasioned 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i informed you sometime since  that i had written to the court of
appeals on the subject of the nossa senhora da soledado san miguel  
almas  and laid before them the papers you sent me  the cause has
since been determined in such a way as will  i hope  be satisfactory
to her portuguese majesty  i enclose the copy of a letter from the
first judge of the court of appeals on that subject 

nothing has yet been done as to the acceptance of your resignation 
nor will  as i believe  anything be done very hastily  many think your
task will not be very burdensome now  and that you may enjoy in peace
the fruit of your past labors 

as this will probably be the last letter  which i shall have the
pleasure of writing to you in my public character  i beg leave to
remind you of the affairs of the alliance and the bon homme richard 
which are still unsettled  i must also pray you not to lose sight of
the vessels detained by his danish majesty  this will be a favorable
opportunity to press for their restitution  i do not see how they can
decently refuse to pay for them  great britain is bound in honor to
make them whole again 

preparations for the evacuation of new york still go on very slowly 
while the distress of our finances has compelled us to grant furloughs
to the greater part of our army 

if it were possible to procure any addition to the last six millions 
it would be extremely useful to us at present 

an entire new arrangement with respect to our foreign department is
under consideration  what its fate will be  i know not 

  i am

  sir 

i wrote to you fully by a vessel from nantes  which i hope will reach
you before this  if not  this may inform you that the ratification of
the treaty with sweden is come  and ready to be exchanged when i shall
receive that from congress  that the treaty with denmark is going on 
and will probably  be ready before the commission for signing it
arrives from congress  it is on the plan of that proposed by congress
for sweden 

portugal has likewise proposed to treat with us  and the ambassador
has earnestly urged me to give him a plan for the consideration of his
court  which i have accordingly done  and he has forwarded it  the
congress will send commissions and instructions for concluding these
treaties to whom they may think proper  it is only upon the old
authority  given  by a resolution  to myself with messrs deane and
lee  to treat with any european powers  that i have ventured to begin
these treaties in consequence of overtures from those crowns 

the definitive treaty with england is not yet concluded  their
ministry being unsettled in their minds as to the terms of the
commercial part  nor is any other definitive treaty yet completed
here  nor even the preliminaries signed of one between england and
holland  it is now five months since we have had a line from you  the
last being dated the 13th of january  of course we know nothing of the
reception of the preliminary articles  or the opinion of congress
respecting them  we hoped to receive before this time such
instructions as might have been thought proper to be sent to us for
rendering more perfect the definitive treaty  we know nothing of what
has been approved or disapproved  we are totally in the dark  and
therefore  less pressing to conclude  being still  as we have long
been  in daily expectation of hearing from you  by chance only  we
learn that barney is arrived  by whom went the despatches of the
commissioners  and a considerable sum of money  no acknowledgment of
the receipt of that money is yet come to hand  either to me or

  dear sir 

we have been honored with several of your letters  and we have talked
of writing to you  but it has been delayed  i will therefore write a
few lines in my private capacity 

our negotiations go on slowly  every proposition being sent to
england  and answers not returning very speedily 

captain barney arrived here last wednesday  and brought despatches for
us as late as the first of june  the preliminary articles are
ratified  but general carleton  in violation of those articles  has
sent away a great number of negroes  alleging  that freedom having
been promised them by a proclamation  the honor of the nation was
concerned      probably another reason may be  that if they had been
restored to their masters  britain could not have hoped anything from
such another proclamation hereafter 

mr hartley called yesterday to tell us  that he had received a letter
from mr fox  assuring him that our suspicions of affected delays or
change of system on their side were groundless  and that they were
sincerely desirous to finish as soon as possible  if this be so  and
your health will permit the journey  i could wish your return as soon
as possible  i want you here on many accounts  and should be glad of
your assistance in considering and answering our public letters  there
are matters in them of which i cannot conveniently give you an account
at present 

nothing could be more seasonable than success in the project you
proposed  but we have now very little expectation 

please to give my love to your valuable and amiable son and daughter 
and believe me  with sincere esteem     

                                                             franklin 

                                                   

     from    rosencrone  minister of denmark  to    franklin

                                           copenhagen  july 8th  1783 

  sir 

it was with the greatest alacrity  that i laid before his majesty the
letter you did me the honor to write to me  as also the project of a
treaty of amity and commerce that accompanied it  the king observed 
with the greatest satisfaction  the assurances contained in that
letter  of the good disposition of congress to form connexions of
amity and commerce with his kingdoms  such connexions being equally
conformable to the interests of the two states  and to his majesty  
sincere desire to cement  by every possible means  that harmony 
union  and confidence  which he wishes to establish forever between
his crown and the united states 

the enclosed  counter project  differs in nothing essential from the
project sent by you  being drawn up entirely conformable to the same
principles  which you will be certainly convinced of  sir  by the note
explaining the reasons for adding some articles  and only giving a
different turn to others  so that i flatter myself  that i shall soon
hear that you are perfectly satisfied with them  having observed the
most perfect reciprocity carefully established throughout 

as to the object mentioned in the letter with which you have honored
me  you already know  sir  his majesty   generous intentions towards
the individuals in question  and his majesty is the more induced to
avail himself of the first opportunity to manifest these intentions 
as he thinks he may reasonably hope that congress will also consider
them as a distinguished proof of his friendship and esteem for that
respectable body 

there remains nothing further for me to add  but that the king will
adopt with great pleasure the most proper means to accelerate the
conclusion of the treaty  which we have begun  for myself  it will be
the most agreeable part of my office  sir  to assist in perfecting
such happy connexions with a minister of such universal reputation as
yourself  and it is with sentiments of the most distinguished regard 
that i have the honor to be

freely navigate from port to port  and on the coasts of the states at
enmity with the other party  and that the vessels and ships being

vessels belonging to the subjects of one of the contracting parties 
although the loading  or part of it  should belong to the enemies of
one of them  it being  nevertheless  well understood  that contraband
goods shall be always excepted  and it is also agreed  that this same
liberty shall extend to the persons of such as shall be found on board

on the high seas as in port  their passports  or sea letters  and
other public documents  which shall expressly prove that their loading

understood  nevertheless  that in all cases  where such merchant
vessels shall be escorted by one or more vessels of war  the simple
declaration of the officer commanding the convoy  that these vessels
do not carry any contraband goods  shall be considered as fully
sufficient  and they shall not require to examine the papers of the

captain  who shall have made the prize  after having received the
merchandise  must immediately release the vessel  and shall not in any
wise prevent the continuation of his voyage  but in case the
contraband merchandise cannot all be taken on board the captor  then
the captain of the said vessel shall be at liberty  notwithstanding

destined to carry them to an enemy   country  or not  if the names of
the persons to whom the effects on board belong  are not expressed in

said majesty  shall succeed them  without any impediment in all their
effects  moveable and immoveable  either by testament or ab intestat 
so that they may take possession of the inheritance  either by
themselves  or by attorney  and dispose of it as they please  after
having discharged the different duties established by the laws of the
state where the said succession shall have been left  and in case that
the heirs of the said dead subjects should be absent or minors  and
that the deceased shall not have appointed guardians or executors  the
property left shall then be inventoried by the notary public  or by
the magistrate of the place  and disposed of in such manner that they
may be kept and preserved for the legal proprietors  and  supposing
that there should arise a dispute about such inheritance among several
pretenders  then the judges of the places where the effects of the
deceased shall be found  shall decide the process by a definitive
sentence agreeably to the laws of the country  the contents of the
present article shall be reciprocally observed  with respect to the
subjects of the united states of america  in the states of his danish
majesty 


                            article xxiv 

a perfect liberty of conscience shall be granted to the subjects and
inhabitants of each party within the respective states  and they may 
consequently  freely attend the worship of their religion without
being disturbed or molested  provided that they submit  as to the
public demonstration  to the ordinances and laws of the country 


                            article xxv 

his majesty  the king of denmark and norway  and the united states of
north america  have agreed  that the present treaty shall be in full
effect during the space of fifteen successive years  reckoning from
the day of its ratification  and the two contracting parties reserve
to themselves the power of renewing it at the expiration of that time 


                             article xxvi 

the present treaty shall be ratified on both sides  and the
ratifications shall be exchanged within the space of eight months from
the date of the signature 


                    explanation of the counter project

        of a treaty of amity and commerce received from denmark  

                              translation 

although the simple comparison of the enclosed counter project  with
the project proposed by mr franklin  evidently proves the attention
that has been shown on our part here to the negotiation set on foot 
and which  in the main  has been agreed upon as to the principles 
which have been adopted for the basis of a treaty  as well as the most
essential stipulations  we could not avoid  however  explaining more
distinctly certain points of the counter project  and the
eclaircissements that will be given of them will at the same time
prove the amicable intentions  with which it has been endeavored to
facilitate the consequences of an affair too important to the welfare
of the two nations  not to merit the attention and cares of the powers
which govern them 

the second and third articles will regulate the conduct of the
reciprocal subjects in the respective states  taking things as they
now are  it is easily perceived that the stipulations of the said
articles  although apparently reciprocal  give however superior
advantages to the united states  for  according to the system of
commerce  which subsists in denmark and norway  the most favored
nations pay there no greater imposts or other duties than the proper
subjects of the state  and the proper subjects of the state enjoy
considerable diminutions with respect to unprivileged nations  as well
for their vessels as their merchandise  it is evident  therefore  that
the subjects of the united states of america being received among the
most favored nations in denmark and norway  would not only gain by
that means a competition with the said most favored  but also a
preference over several other nations  even in the neighborhood of
denmark  with whom no treaties of commerce have been concluded  and
who  therefore  are still in the number of unprivileged  as to
navigation and commerce  in the states of his danish majesty 

on the other hand  if the advantages  which would result from these
articles  as to the commerce of the subjects of denmark in the
territories of the united states  are considered  the said advantages
would be confined to the simple competition with every other foreign
nation  but  as there is no nation that we know of  which actually
pays in the territories of the united states other or greater duties 
than what the privileged or most favored nations are bound to pay  the
danish subjects would not find in the territories of the united states
the same preference  which the subjects of the united states would
obtain in denmark and norway  the preceding considerations are not
advanced for the purpose of taking any advantage  but they are pointed
out only to show the impartiality and good will  with which we desire
to contribute to the mutual connexions of amity and commerce between
the two nations  who will  it is to be hoped  more and more unite  as
to the periods inserted in these articles  they do not essentially
change the stipulations projected by the minister of the united
states  they only add therein some proper determination to prevent
every misunderstanding on the subject of the reciprocal liberties and
privileges  and to guaranty some rights  which the subjects of his
danish majesty enjoy with respect to certain countries and colonies 
as iceland  greenland  finmarson  faro  the establishment of
tranquibar  and  in certain respects  the islands of st croix  st
thomas  and st john  and if  at any time  it should please the united
states to reserve for its own subjects similar rights  with respect to
certain places  or certain kinds of merchandise  and to exclude
therefrom every foreign nation  the same stipulations shall then suit
their intentions  in like manner the same mark of reciprocity has been
given to every change  excepting only the last clause of the third
article  which has not been susceptible of the same turn  considering
the local position of the united states  and which  undoubtedly for
the same reason  has been inserted in the treaty of the united states
with holland  in the same manner as it is here in the counter project 

after having pointed out the privileges  which the subjects of his
danish majesty enjoy in the islands of st croix  st thomas  and st
john  it will not be useless to observe  that it is only the commerce
and navigation between the said islands and europe  which denmark has
appropriated to itself in any manner  but the commerce  which is
conducted between those islands and north america  although always
subject to the same interior regulations on both sides  has been for a
long while authorised by his danish majesty   commercial laws  and his
said majesty has  moreover  granted to the islands of st thomas and st
john privileges  which will give the commerce of these islands  with
america in particular  a freer course  and very different from that of
the commerce of the colony  the advantages  which the united states
may derive from a more close commercial connexion with the said
privileged islands  and whose ports  distinguished by the security
they insure to vessels  appear to invite the commercial subjects of
america  are too evident to need any circumstantial detail  there
shall only be added  therefore  to what has been said  this single
observation  that his danish majesty  having it very much at heart to
open every possible road to industry and commerce  finds himself much
disposed to favor the connexion in question  and that  if for this
purpose the united states  after the conclusion of the present treaty 
which shall fix the general commercial points between the contracting
parties  should desire a particular convention to agree upon the
reciprocal and local advantages proper to accomplish this object  his
said majesty would willingly come into it  provided that the united
states were equally disposed on their part to facilitate the affair 

the fourth and fifth articles have only been modified in order to
remove the doubts  which might arise with respect to the defence and
protection due to the vessels belonging to the respective subjects  it
is only in cases of attack from the common enemy  against whom it was
conceived possible to confine each other by these articles  for in
case that one of the parties was at war and the other at peace  the
vessels belonging to the neutral party could not protect the vessels
belonging to the belligerent party  without taking a part and quitting
its neutrality 

the privileges of the most favored nations undoubtedly guaranty to the
respective subjects the favors mentioned in the sixth  eleventh 
fourteenth  and seventeenth articles of the project  for this reason
it has appeared  that it would be better to reduce the points detailed
in these articles to the number of general liberties of the most
favored nations  and this is what has been done in the sixth 
thirteenth  sixteenth  and twentyfirst articles of the counter
project  contenting ourselves here with the assurance  that the
subjects of his danish majesty in the cases mentioned here  as well as
in any other  shall be regarded and treated in the territories within
the dominions of the united states as the most favored nations  and in
expectation that the united states will not demand anything more in
these respects 

the seventh  eighth  and ninth articles of the counter project only
contain the spirit and ideas of the fifteenth  seventh  and eighth
articles of the project  to which has been added some further
stipulations  conformable to the principles  which have been
established and acknowledged with respect to the commerce of neutral
nations in time of war 

the term of two months  which has been proposed in the ninth article 
and that of six months named in the twelfth article of the project 
did not appear to correspond with the extent of commerce  which is
carried on  particularly with the east indies  nor with difficulties 
which the merchants or inhabitants sometimes find in arranging their
affairs to change their abode  it is for this reason  that instead of
two and six months  the terms six and nine months have been
substituted  it being nevertheless well understood  that from the
friendship and good understanding  which is about being strengthened
between the two nations  the subjects of neither party will ever have
cause to take refuge on account of a rupture 

although no fault has been found as to the merchandise  which the
project has called contraband  or not contraband in time of war  there
is however reason to think  that it would still be better for the
conveniency of the contracting parties  only to name in express terms
the contraband  without detailing the free merchandise  with respect
to which no better explanation could be given  as it appears  than by
agreeing that everything that is not called contraband shall be
comprehended in the number of free merchandise  consequently  on this
principle  the seventeenth article of the counter project has been
arranged  and at the end of the article has been added the definition
of a port that is blocked up 

the new articles that have been proposed on this side principally turn
on reciprocal points and favors  which justice and equity demand  and
which humanity and the rights of nations ordinarily grant  even
without stipulation by express conventions  but it is usage that has
introduced them into treaties  and it is conceived that it is no less
necessary to conform thereto 

as to the passports mentioned in the eighteenth article of the counter
project  there is nothing easier than to agree about them after the
conclusion of the treaty  or at the time when it is concluded  and the
models that shall be agreed on can then be officially exchanged and
published in case of necessity

  sir 

his imperial majesty  the emperor of morocco  did me the honor to
appoint me to be the bearer of his answer to the united provinces of
north america  with which he is willing to sign a treaty of peace and
commerce  and in consequence has already given orders to his captains
of men of war not to molest on the open seas the american vessels 
which agreeable news i have already given to mr richard harrison 
according to my instructions  i am to accompany to the court of
morocco the ambassador  that will be appointed to conclude the treaty
of peace  i presume  that your excellency is already acquainted  that
the travelling expenses and other charges of ambassadors  or envoys 
sent to europe by the emperor of morocco  are to be paid by the court 
or republic  that demands his friendship  in a few days i intend to
set out for madrid  where i will remain till i receive your
excellency   answer to this letter  directed to william carmichael 
the united states chargé   affaires at the court of spain  who  i make
no doubt  will receive orders to supply me with the money i may want
on the occasion 

as soon as i arrive at paris i shall have the satisfaction to
entertain at large your excellency on the present negotiation  not
doubting it will soon be concluded to the advantage of both courts 

  in the meantime i remain  most truly  sir     

                                             giacomo francisco crocco 

        i was obliged to call on a friend to write you this letter in
english  otherwise i could only do it in the italian language

                        passy  july 22   1783 

  sir 

you have complained  sometimes with reason  of not hearing from your
foreign ministers  we have had cause to make the same complaint  six
full months having intervened between the latest date of your
preceding letters and the receipt of those by captain barney  during
all this time we were ignorant of the reception of the provisional
treaty  and the sentiments of congress upon it  which  if we had
received sooner  might have forwarded the proceedings on the
definitive treaty  and  perhaps  brought them to a conclusion  at a
time more favorable than the present  but these occasional
interruptions of correspondence are the inevitable consequences of a
state of war  and of such remote situations  barney had a short
passage  and arrived some days before colonel ogden  who also brought
despatches from you  all of which are come safe to hand  we  the
commissioners  have in our joint capacity written a letter to you 
which you will receive with this 

i shall now answer yours of march the 26th  may the 9th  and may the
31st 

it gave me great pleasure to learn by the first  that the news of
peace diffused general satisfaction  i will not now take it upon me to
justify the apparent reserve  respecting this court  at the signature 
which you disapprove  we have touched upon it in our general letter  i
do not see  however  that they have much reason to complain of that
transaction  nothing was stipulated to their prejudice  and none of
the stipulations were to have force  but by a subsequent act of their
own  i suppose  indeed  that they have not complained of it  or you
would have sent us a copy of the complaint  that we might have
answered it  i long since satisfied count de vergennes about it here 
we did what appeared to all of us best at the time  and if we have
done wrong  the congress will do right  after hearing us  to censure
us  their nomination of five persons to the service seems to mark 
that they had some dependence on our joint judgment  since one alone
could have made a treaty by direction of the french ministry as well
as twenty 

i will only add  that with respect to myself  neither the letter from
   marbois  handed us through the british negotiators   a suspicious
channel  nor the conversations respecting the fishery  the boundaries 
the royalists      recommending moderation in our demands  are of
weight sufficient in my mind to fix an opinion  that this court wished
to restrain us  in obtaining any degree of advantage we could prevail
on our enemies to accord  since those discourses are fairly
resolvable  by supposing a very natural apprehension  that we  relying
too much on the ability of france to continue the war in our favor 
and supply us constantly with money  might insist on more advantages
than the english would be willing to grant  and thereby lose the
opportunity of making peace  so necessary to all our friends 

i ought not  however  to conceal from you  that one of my colleagues
is of a very different opinion from me in these matters  he thinks the
french minister one of the greatest enemies of our country  that he
would have straitened our boundaries  to prevent the growth of our
people  contracted our fishery  to obstruct the increase of our
seamen  and retained the royalists among us  to keep us divided  that
he privately opposes all our negotiations with foreign courts  and
afforded us  during the war  the assistance we received only to keep
it alive  that we might be so much the more weakened by it  that to
think of gratitude to france is the greatest of follies  and that to
be influenced by it would ruin us  he makes no secret of his having
these opinions  expresses them publicly  sometimes in presence of the
english ministers  and speaks of hundreds of instances which he could
produce in proof of them  none  however  have yet appeared to me 
unless the conversations and letter abovementioned are reckoned such 

if i were not convinced of the real inability of this court to furnish
the further supplies we asked  i should suspect these discourses of a
person in his station might have influenced the refusal  but i think
they have gone no further than to occasion a suspicion  that we have a
considerable party of antigallicans in america  who are not tories 
and consequently  to produce some doubts of the continuance of our
friendship  as such doubts may hereafter have a bad effect  i think we
cannot take too much care to remove them  and it is  therefore  i
write this to put you on your guard   believing it my duty  though i
know that i hazard by it a mortal enmity  and to caution you
respecting the insinuations of this gentleman against this court  and
the instances he supposes of their ill will to us  which i take to be
as imaginary as i know his fancies to be  that count de vergennes and
myself are continually plotting against him  and employing the
newswriters of europe to depreciate his character      but as
shakspeare says   trifles light as air       i am persuaded  however 
that he means well for his country  is always an honest man  often a
wise one  but sometimes  and in some things  absolutely out of his
senses 

when the commercial article  mentioned in yours of the 26th  was
struck out of our proposed preliminaries by the british ministry  the
reason given was  that sundry acts of parliament still in force were
against it  and must be first repealed  which i believe was really
their intention  and sundry bills were accordingly brought in for
that purpose  but new ministers with different principles succeeding 
a commercial proclamation totally different from those bills has
lately appeared  i send enclosed a copy of it  we shall try what can
be done in the definitive treaty towards setting aside that
proclamation  but if it should be persisted in  it will then be a
matter worthy the attentive discussion of congress  whether it will be
most prudent to retort with a similar regulation in order to force its
repeal   which may possibly tend to bring on another quarrel  or to
let it pass without notice  and leave it to its own inconvenience  or
rather impracticability in the execution  and to the complaints of the
west india planters  who must all pay much dearer for our produce
under those restrictions 

i am not enough master of the course of our commerce to give an
opinion on this particular question  and it does not behove me to do
it  yet i have seen so much embarrassment and so little advantage in
all the restraining and compulsive systems  that i feel myself
strongly inclined to believe  that a state  which leaves all her ports
open to all the world upon equal terms  will  by that means  have
foreign commodities cheaper  sell its own productions dearer  and be
on the whole the most prosperous  i have heard some merchants say 
that there is ten per cent difference between  will you buy   and
 will you sell   when foreigners bring us their goods  they want to
part with them speedily  that they may purchase their cargoes and
despatch their ships  which are at constant charges in our ports  we
have then the advantage of their  will you buy   and when they demand
our produce  we have the advantage of their  will you sell   and the
concurring demands of a number also contribute to raise our prices 
thus both those questions are in our favor at home  against us
abroad 

the employing  however  of our own ships and raising a breed of seamen
among us  though it should not be a matter of so much private profit
as some imagine  is nevertheless of political importance  and must
have weight in considering this subject 

the judgment you make of the conduct of france in the peace  and the
greater glory acquired by her moderation than even by her arms 
appears to me perfectly just  the character of this court and nation
seems  of late years  to be considerably changed  the ideas of
aggrandisement by conquest are out of fashion  and those of commerce
are more enlightened and more generous than heretofore  we shall soon 
i believe  feel something of this in our being admitted to a greater
freedom of trade with their islands  the wise here think france great
enough  and its ambition at present seems to be only that of justice
and magnanimity towards other nations  fidelity and utility to its
allies 

the ambassador of portugal was much pleased with the proceedings
relating to their vessel  which you sent me  and assures me they will
have a good effect at his court  he appears extremely desirous of a
treaty with our states  i have accordingly proposed to him the plan of
one  nearly the same with that sent me for sweden  and after my
agreeing to some alterations  he has sent it to his court for
approbation  he told me at versailles  last tuesday  that he expected
its return to him on saturday next  and anxiously desired that i would
not despatch our packet without it  that congress might consider it 
and  if approved  send a commission to me or some other minister to
sign it 

i venture to go thus far in treating  on the authority only of a kind
of general power  given formerly by a resolution of congress to messrs
franklin  deane  and lee  but a special commission seems more proper
to complete a treaty  and more agreeable to the usual forms of such
business 

i am in just the same situation with denmark  that court by its
minister here has desired a treaty with us  i have proposed a plan
formed on that sent me for sweden  it has been under consideration
some time at copenhagen  and is expected here this week  so that i may
possibly send that also by this conveyance  you will have seen by my
letter to the danish prime minister  that i did not forget the affair
of the prizes  what i then wrote  produced a verbal offer made me
here  of £10 000 sterling  proposed to be given by his majesty to the
captors  if i would accept it as a full discharge of our demand  i
could not do this  i said  because it was not more than a fifth part
of the estimated value  in answer  i was told that the estimation was
probably extravagant  that it would be difficult to come at the
knowledge of their true value  and that whatever they might be worth
in themselves  they should not be estimated as of such value to us
when at bergen  since the english probably watched them  and might
have retaken them in their way to america  at least  they were at the
common risk of the seas and enemies  and the insurance was a
considerable drawback  that this sum might be considered as so much
saved for us by the king   interference  for that if the english
claimants had been suffered to carry the cause into the common courts 
they must have recovered the prizes by the laws of denmark  it was
added  that the king   honor was concerned  that he sincerely desired
our friendship  but he would avoid  by giving this sum in the form of
a present to the captors  the appearance of its being exacted from him
as the reparation of an injury  when it was really intended rather as
a proof of his strong disposition to cultivate a good understanding
with us 

i replied  that the value might possibly be exaggerated  but that we
did not desire more than should be found just on inquiry  and that it
was not difficult to learn from london what sums were insured upon the
ships and cargoes  which would be some guide  and that a reasonable
abatement might be made for the risk  but that the congress could not 
in justice to their mariners  deprive them of any part that was truly
due to those brave men  whatever abatement they might think fit to
make  as a mark of their regard for the king   friendship  of the part
belonging to the public  that i had  however  no instructions or
authority to make any abatement of any kind  and could  therefore 
only acquaint congress with the offer  and the reasons that
accompanied it  which i promised to state fully and candidly  as i
have now done  and attend their orders  desiring only that it might be
observed  we had presented our complaint with decency  that we had
charged no fault on the danish government  but what might arise from
inattention or precipitancy  and that we had intimated no resentment 
but had waited with patience and respect the king   determination 
confiding  that he would follow the equitable disposition of his own
breast  by doing us justice as soon as he could do it with
conveniency  that the best and wisest princes sometimes erred  that it
belonged to the condition of man  and was  therefore  inevitable  and
that the true honor in such cases consisted not in disowning or hiding
the error  but in making ample reparation  that  though i could not
accept what was offered on the terms proposed  our treaty might go on 
and its articles be prepared and considered  and  in the mean time  i
hoped his danish majesty would reconsider the offer  and make it more
adequate to the loss we had sustained  thus that matter rests  but i
hourly expect to hear further  and perhaps may have more to say on it
before the ship   departure 

i shall be glad to have the proceedings you mention respecting the
brig providentia  i hope the equity and justice of our admiralty
courts  respecting the property of strangers  will always maintain
their reputation  and i wish particularly to cultivate the disposition
of friendship towards us  apparent in the late proceedings of denmark 
as the danish islands may be of use to our west india commerce  while
the english impolitic restraints continue 

the elector of saxony  as i understand from his minister here  has
thoughts of sending one to congress  and proposing a treaty of
commerce and amity with us  prussia has likewise an inclination to
share in a trade with america  and the minister of that court  though
he has not directly proposed a treaty  has given me a packet of lists
of the several sorts of merchandise they can furnish us with  which he
requests me to send to america for the information of our merchants 

i have received no answer yet from congress to my request of being
dismissed from their service  they should  methinks  reflect  that if
they continue me here  the faults i may henceforth commit  through the
infirmities of age  will be rather theirs than mine  i am glad my
journal afforded you any pleasure  i will  as you desire  endeavor to
continue it  i thank you for the pamphlet  it contains a great deal
of information respecting our finances  we shall  as you advise  avoid
publishing it  but i see they are publishing it in the english papers 
i was glad i had a copy authenticated by the signature of secretary
thompson  by which i could assure count de vergennes  that the money
contract i had made with him was ratified by congress  he having just
before expressed some uneasiness to me at its being so long neglected 
i find it was ratified soon after it was received  but the
ratification  except in that pamphlet  has not yet come to hand  i
have done my best to procure the further loan directed by the
resolution of congress  it was not possible  i have written on that
matter to mr morris  i wish the rest of the estimates of losses and
mischiefs were come to hand  they would still be of use 

mr barclay has in his hands the affair of the alliance and bon homme
richard  i will afford him all the assistance in my power  but it is a
very perplexed business  that expedition  though for particular
reasons under american commissions and colors  was carried on at the
king   expense  and under his orders     de chaumont was the agent
appointed by the minister of marine to make the outfit  he was also
chosen by all the captains of the squadron  as appears by an
instrument under their hands  to be their agent  receive  sell  and
divide prizes      the crown bought two of them at public sale  and
the money i understand is lodged in the hands of a responsible person
at   orient     de chaumont says he has given in his accounts to the
marine  and that he has no more to do with the affair  except to
receive a balance due to him  that account  however  is i believe
unsettled  and the absence of some of the captains is said to make
another difficulty  which retards the completion of the business  i
never paid or received anything relating to that expedition  nor had
any other concern in it  than barely ordering the alliance to join the
squadron at    de sartine   request  i know not whether the other
captains will not claim a share in what we may obtain from denmark 
though the prizes were made by the alliance  when separate from the
squadron  if so  that is another difficulty in the way of making
abatement in our demand  without their consent 

i am sorry to find  that you have thoughts of quitting the service  i
do not think your place can be easily well supplied  you mention  that
an entire new arrangement  with respect to foreign affairs  is under
consideration  i wish to know whether any notice is likely to be taken
in it of my grandson  he has now gone through an apprenticeship of
near seven years in the ministerial business  and is very capable of
serving the states in that line  as possessing all the requisites of
knowledge  zeal  activity  language  and address  he is well liked
here  and count de vergennes has expressed to me in warm terms his
very good opinion of him  the late swedish ambassador  count de
creutz  who has gone home to be prime minister  desired i would
endeavor to procure his being sent to sweden  with a public character 
assuring me  that he should be glad to receive him there as our
minister  and that he knew it would be pleasing to the king  18  the
present swedish ambassador has also proposed the same thing to me  as
you will see by a letter of his  which i enclose  19  one of the
danish ministers     walterstorff  who will probably be sent in a
public character to congress  has also expressed his wish  that my
grandson may be sent to denmark  but it is not my custom to solicit
employments for myself  or any of my family  and i shall not do it in
this case  i only hope  that if he is not to be employed in your new
arrangement  i may be informed of it as soon as possible  that while i
have strength left for it  i may accompany him in a tour to italy 
returning through germany  which i think he may make to more advantage
with me than alone  and which i have long promised to afford him  as a
reward for his faithful service  and his tender filial attachment to
me

 july 25th   while i was writing the above    walterstorff came in 
and delivered me a packet from    rosencrone  the danish prime
minister  containing the project of the treaty with some proposed
alterations  and a paper of reasons in support of them  20  fearing
that we should not have time to copy them  i send herewith the
originals  relying on his promise to furnish me with copies in a few
days  he seemed to think  that the interest of the merchants is
concerned in the immediate conclusion of the treaty  that they may
form their plans of commerce  and wished to know whether i did not
think my general power  above mentioned  sufficient for that purpose 
i told him i thought a particular commission more agreeable to the
forms  but if his danish majesty would be content for the present with
the general authority  formerly given to me  i believed i might
venture to act upon it  reserving by a separate article to congress
the power of shortening the term in case any part of the treaty
should not be to their mind  unless the alteration of such part should
hereafter be agreed on

the prince de deuxponts was lately at paris  and applied to me for
information  respecting a commerce which is desired between the
electorate of bavaria and america  i have it also from a good hand at
the court of vienna  that the emperor is desirous of establishing a
commerce with us from trieste  as well as flanders  and would make a
treaty with us if proposed to him  since our trade is laid open  and
no longer a monopoly to england  all europe seems desirous of sharing
in it  and for that purpose to cultivate our friendship  that it may
be better known everywhere  what sort of people  and what kind of
government they will have to treat with  i prevailed with our friend 
the duc de la rochefoucault  to translate our book of constitutions
into french  and i presented copies to all the foreign ministers  i
send you one herewith  they are much admired by the politicians here 
and it is thought will induce considerable emigrations of substantial
people from different parts of europe to america  it is particularly a
matter of wonder  that in the midst of a cruel war  raging in the
bowels of our country  our sages should have the firmness of mind to
sit down calmly and form such complete plans of government  they add
considerably to the reputation of the united states 

i have mentioned above the port of trieste  with which we may possibly
have a commerce  and i am told that many useful productions and
manufactures of hungary may be had extremely cheap there  but it
becomes necessary first to consider how our mediterranean trade is to
be protected from the corsairs of barbary  you will see by the
enclosed copy of a letter 21  i received from algiers  the danger two
of our ships escaped last winter  i think it not improbable  that
those rovers may be privately encouraged by the english to fall upon
us  and to prevent our interference in the carrying trade  for i have
in london heard it is a maxim among the merchants  that if  there were
no algiers  it would be worth england   while to build one   i wonder 
however  that the rest of europe do not combine to destroy those
nests  and secure commerce from their future piracies

i made the grand master of malta a present of one of our medals in
silver  writing to him a letter  of which i enclose a copy  22  and i
believe our people will be kindly received in his ports  but that is
not sufficient  and perhaps now we have peace  it will be proper to
send ministers  with suitable presents  to establish a friendship with
the emperor of morocco  and the other barbary states  if possible  mr
jay will inform you of some steps  that have been taken by a person at
alicant  without authority  towards a treaty with that emperor  i send
you herewith a few more of the abovementioned medals  which have given
great satisfaction to this court and nation  i should be glad to know
how they are liked with you

our people  who were prisoners in england  are now all discharged 
during the whole war  those who were in forton prison  near
portsmouth  were much befriended by the constant charitable care of mr
wren  a presbyterian minister there  who spared no pains to assist
them in their sickness and distress  by procuring and distributing
among them the contributions of good christians  and prudently
dispensing the allowance i made them  which gave him a great deal of
trouble  but he went through it cheerfully  i think some public notice
should be taken of this good man  i wish the congress would enable me
to make him a present  and that some of our universities would confer
upon him the degree of doctor 

the duke of manchester  who has always been our friend in the house of
lords  is now here as ambassador from england  i dine with him today

her most faithful majesty  the queen of portugal and algarva  and the
united states of north america  anxious to fix in an equitable and
permanent manner the regulation  which ought to be observed with
regard to the commerce they wish to establish between their respective
countries  conceive that they cannot more effectually attain this end
than by observing as the basis of their arrangement the most perfect
equality and reciprocity  allowing each party the liberty of making
such interior regulations respecting their commerce and navigation as
may best suit them  resting the advantages of commerce on its
reciprocal utility and the laws of a just concurrence  in consequence

the apostolical nuncio has the honor to send mr franklin the enclosed
note  which he requests he will be pleased to forward to the congress
of the united states of north america  and support it with his credit 

                                                      july 28th  1783 


                                 note 

before the revolution  which has just been completed in north america 
the catholics and missionaries of those provinces depended  as to
their spiritual concerns  on the apostolical vicar  resident in
london  it is well known that this arrangement can no longer exist 
but as it is essential that the catholic subjects of the united states
should have an ecclesiastic to govern them in their religious
concerns  the congregation  de propagandâ fide  existing at rome for
the establishment and conservation of missions  has come to the
determination of proposing to congress to establish  in some city of
the united states of north america  one of their catholic subjects 
with the powers of apostolical vicar  and in the character of bishop 
or simply in quality of apostolical prefect 

the establishment of an apostolical vicar bishop appears the most
eligible  the more so as the catholic subjects of the united states
would find themselves in a situation to receive confirmation and
orders in their own country  without being obliged to go for that
purpose to the country of a foreign power  and as it might sometimes
happen  that among the subjects of the united states  there might be
no person in a situation to be charged with the spiritual government 
either as bishop or apostolical prefect  it would be necessary  in
such circumstances  that congress should consent to choose him from
among the subjects of a foreign nation the most friendly with the
united states

after a continued course of treating for nine months  the english

their own as well as ours  and they offer to sign again as a
definitive treaty  the articles of november the 30th  1782  the
ratifications of which have already been exchanged  we have agreed to
this  and on wednesday next  the third of september  it will be
signed  with all the definitive treaties  establishing a general
peace  which may god long continue

  my dear friend 

enclosed is my letter to mr fox  i beg you would assure him  that my
expressions of esteem for him are not mere professions  i really think
him a  great  man  and i would not think so if i did not believe he
was at bottom  and would prove himself a  good  one  guard him against
mistaken notions of the american people  you have deceived yourselves
too long with vain expectations of reaping advantage from our little
discontents  we are more thoroughly an enlightened people  with
respect to our political interests  than perhaps any other under
heaven  every man among us reads  and is so easy in his circumstances
as to have leisure for conversations of improvement  and for acquiring
information  our domestic misunderstandings  when we have them  are of
small extent  though monstrously magnified by your microscopic
newspapers  he who judges from them  that we are on the point of
falling into anarchy  or returning to the obedience of britain  is
like one who being shown some spots in the sun should fancy  that the
whole disk would soon be overspread with them  and that there would be
an end of daylight  the great body of intelligence among our people 
surrounds and overpowers our petty dissensions  as the sun   great
mass of fire diminishes and destroys his spots  do not  therefore  any
longer delay the evacuation of new york  in the vain hope of a new
revolution in your favor  if such a hope has indeed had any effect in
occasioning the delay  it is now nine months since the evacuations
were promised  you expect with reason  that the people of new york
should do your merchants justice in the payment of their old debts 
consider the injustice you do them in keeping them so long out of
their habitations  and out of their business  by which they might have
been enabled to make payment  there is no truth more clear to me than
this  that the great interests of our two countries is a thorough
reconciliation  restraints on the freedom of commerce and intercourse
between us  can afford no advantage equivalent to the mischief they
will do  by keeping up ill humor and promoting a total alienation  let
you and me  my dear friend  do our best towards advancing and securing
that reconciliation  we can do nothing  that will in a dying hour
afford us more solid satisfaction 

i wish you a prosperous journey  and a happy sight of your friends 
present my best respects to your good brother and sister  and believe
me ever  with sincere and great esteem  yours affectionately 

                                                             franklin 

                                                   

                             to john jay 

                                          passy  september 10th  1783 

  sir 

i have received a letter from a very respectable person in america 
containing the following words  viz 

 it is confidently reported  propagated  and believed by some among
us  that the court of france was at the bottom against our obtaining
the fishery and territory in that great extent  in which both are
secured to us by the treaty  that our minister at that court favored 
or did not oppose this design against us  and that it was entirely
owing to the firmness  sagacity  and disinterestedness of mr adams 
with whom mr jay united  that we have obtained these important
advantages  

it is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honor of that treaty 
which the friends of my colleagues may be disposed to give them  but
having now spent fifty years of my life in public offices and trusts 
and having still one ambition left  that of carrying the character of
fidelity at least to the grave with me  i cannot allow that i was
behind any of them in zeal and faithfulness  i therefore think  that i
ought not to suffer an accusation  which falls little short of treason
to my country  to pass without notice  when the means of effectual
vindication are at hand  you  sir  were a witness of my conduct in
that affair  to you and my other colleagues i appeal  by sending to
each a similar letter with this  and i have no doubt of your
readiness to do a brother commissioner justice  by certificates  that
will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation 

i have the honor to be  with much esteem     

                                                             franklin 

                                                   

                       john jay to    franklin 

                                          passy  september 11th  1783 

  sir 

i have been favored with your letter of yesterday  and will answer it
explicitly  i have no reason whatever to believe  that you were averse
to our obtaining the full extent of boundary and fishery secured to us
by the treaty  your conduct respecting them throughout the negotiation
indicated a strong  a steady attachment to both those objects  and in
my opinion promoted the attainment of them 

i remember  that in a conversation  which    de rayneval  the first
secretary of count de vergennes  had with you and me  in the summer of
1782  you contended for our full right to the fishery  and argued it
on various principles 

your letters to me  when in spain  considered our territory as
extending to the mississippi  and expressed your opinion against
ceding the navigation of that river  in very strong and pointed terms 

in short  sir  i do not recollect the least difference in sentiment
between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries  on the contrary  we
were unanimous and united in adhering to  and insisting on them  nor
did i perceive the least disposition in either of us to recede from
our claims  or be satisfied with less than we obtained 

i have the honor to be  with great respect and esteem      23

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on
the 10th of this month  in which you say you have received a letter
from a very respectable person in america  containing the following
words  viz   it is confidently reported  propagated  and believed by
some among us  that the court of france was at the bottom against our
obtaining the fishery and territory in that great extent  in which
both are secured to us by the treaty  that our minister at that court
favored  or did not oppose this design against us  and that it was
entirely owing to the firmness  sagacity  and disinterestedness of mr
adams  with whom mr jay united  that we have obtained those important
advantages  

it is unnecessary for me to say anything upon this subject  more than
to quote the words which i wrote in the evening of the 30th of
november  1782  and which have been received and read in congress 
viz   as soon as i arrived in paris  i waited on mr jay  and learned
from him the rise and progress of the negotiation  nothing that has
happened  since the beginning of the controversy in 1761  has ever
struck me more forcibly or affected me more intimately  than that
entire coincidence of principles and opinion between him and me  in
about three days i went out to passy  and spent the evening with dr
franklin  and entered largely into conversation with him upon the
course and present state of our foreign affairs  i told him my opinion
without reserve of the policy of this court  and of the principles 
wisdom  and firmness with which mr jay had conducted the negotiation
in his sickness and my absence  and that i was determined to support
mr jay to the utmost of my power in pursuit of the same system  the
doctor heard me patiently and said nothing  

 the first conference we had afterwards with mr oswald in considering
one point and another  dr franklin turned to mr jay and said   i am of
your opinion  and will go on with these gentlemen without consulting
this court   he has accordingly met us in most of our conferences  and
has gone on with us in entire harmony and unanimity throughout  and
has been able and useful  both by his sagacity and reputation  in the
whole negotiation   24 

  i have the honor to be  very respectfully  sir 

                                                           john adams

                                          passy  september 13th  1783 

  sir 

i received a few days since  the private letter your excellency did me
the honor of writing to me of the 13th of june  i regret with you the
resignation of the late secretary  your present cares are increased by
it  and it will be difficult to find a successor of equal abilities 

we found no difficulty in deciphering the resolution of congress  the
commissioners have taken no notice of it in our public letter 

i am happy to hear that both the device and workmanship of the medal
are approved with you  as they have the good fortune to be by the best
judges on this side of the water  it has been esteemed a well timed 
as well as a well merited compliment here  and has its good effects 
since the two first  which you mention as received  i have sent by
different opportunities so many  as that every member of congress
might have one  i hope they are come safe to hand by this time 

i wrote a long letter to mr livingston by mr barney  to which i beg
leave to refer  enclosing a copy 

we had  before signing the definitive treaty  received the
ratification of the preliminary articles by his britannic majesty 
exchanged with us by mr hartley for that of the congress  i send
herewith a copy of the first and last clauses 

in a former letter i mentioned the volunteer proceedings of a merchant
at alicant  towards obtaining a treaty between us and the emperor of
morocco  we have since received a letter from a person who says  as
you will see by the copy enclosed  that he is sent by the emperor to
be the bearer of his answer to the united states  and that he is
arrived in spain on his way to paris  he has not yet appeared here 
and we hardly know what answer to give him  i hope the sending a
minister to that court  as recommended in my last  has been taken into
consideration  or at least that some instructions respecting that
nation have been sent to your minister in spain  who is better
situated than we are for such a negotiation  25 

the minister from denmark often speaks to me about the proposed
treaty  of which a copy went by mr barney  no commission to sign it 
nor any instructions from congress relating to it are yet arrived  and
though pressed  i have not ventured to do anything further in the
affair 

i forward herewith a letter to the congress from the city of
hamburg  26  i understand that a good disposition towards us prevails
there  which it may be well to encourage 

no answer has yet been given me from the court of portugal  respecting
the plan of a treaty concerted between its ambassador here and me  he
has been unwell and much in the country  so that i have not seen him
lately  i suspect that the false or exaggerated reports of the
distracted situation of our government  industriously propagated
throughout europe by our enemies  have made an impression in that
kingdom to our disadvantage  and inclined them to hesitate in forming
a connexion with us  questions asked me  and observations made by
several of the foreign ministers here  convince me that the idle
stories of our disunion  contempt of authority  refusal to pay taxes 
    have been too much credited  and been very injurious to our
reputation 

i sent before a copy of the letter i wrote to the grand master of
malta  with a present of our medal  with this you will have a copy of
his answer  27  i send also a copy of a note i received from the
pope   nuncio  28  he is very civil on all occasions  and has
mentioned the possibility of an advantageous trade america might have
with the ecclesiastical state  which he says has two good ports 
civita vecchia  and      

this court continues favorable to us  count de vergennes was resolute
in refusing to sign the definitive treaty with england before ours was
signed  the english ministers were offended  but complied  i am
convinced that court will never cease endeavoring to disunite us  we
shall  i hope  be constantly on our guard against those machinations 
for our safety consists in a steady adherence to our friends  and our
reputation in a faithful regard to treaties  and in a grateful conduct
towards our benefactors 

i send herewith sundry memorials recommended to my care by count de
vergennes  viz  one respecting a claim of messieurs fosters  of
bordeaux  one of    pequet  and one of    bayard  the congress will
take such notice of them as they shall think proper 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be

  my dear friend 

i am at present at bath with my dearest sister  whom i have found as
well as i could have expected  and i hope with reasonable prospect of
recovery in time  i have seen my friends in the ministry  and hope
things will go on well  with them i am sure all is right and firm  the
chief part of the cabinet ministers are out of town  but there will be
a full cabinet held in a few days  in which a specific proposition  in
the nature of a temporary convention  will be given in instructions to
me  i imagine nearly upon the ground of my memorial of may 19th  1783 
which i delivered to the american ministers  viz   american ships not
to bring foreign manufactures into great britain  nor to trade
directly between the british west indies and great britain   all the
rest to be as before the war  i expect that something to this effect
will be their determination in the affair  and if it should be so  i
shall hope not to meet with difficulty on your parts  i want to see
some specific beginning  as to any further proposition respecting the
trade between great britain and the british west indies  i doubt
whether any such can be discussed before the meeting of parliament  i
wish to look forward not only to the continuation of peace between our
two countries  but to the improvement of reconciliation into alliance 
and therefore i wish the two parties to be disposed to accommodate
each other  without the strict account by weights and scales  as
between aliens and strangers  actuated towards each other by no other
principle than cold and equalizing indifference  friendly dispositions
presumed have their fairest chance of being realized  but if we should
set out presuming against them  the good which might have happened may
be prevented  pray remember me to your three colleagues  and to all
friends 

  yours  ever most affectionately

mr thaxter  late secretary of mr adams  who is charged with all our
despatches  that were intended to go by the french packet boat  writes
from   orient  that though he arrived there two days before the time
appointed for her sailing  he missed reaching her by four hours  but
another light vessel was fitting  and would sail the 21st instant  in
which he hoped to arrive at new york  nearly as soon as the packet  we
shall send duplicates by the next from hence 

in the meantime i enclose a printed copy of the definitive treaty 
which i hear is ratified  indeed we have the ratification of the
preliminaries 

mr hartley  when he left us  expected to return in three weeks  in
order to proceed with us in forming a treaty of commerce  the new
commission  that was intended for us  is not yet come to hand 

with great respect  i have the honor to be  sir

  my dear friend 

i have nothing material to write to you respecting public affairs  but
i cannot let mr adams  who will see you  go without a line to inquire
after your welfare  to inform you of mine  and assure you of my
constant respect and attachment 

i think with you  that your quaker article is a good one  and that men
will in time have sense enough to adopt it  but i fear that time is
not yet come 

what would you think of a proposition  if i should make it  of a
compact between england  france  and america  america would be as
happy as the sabine girls  if she could be the means of uniting in
perpetual peace her father and her husband  what repeated follies are
those repeated wars  you do not want to conquer and govern one
another  why then should you be continually employed in injuring and
destroying one another  how many excellent things might have been done
to promote the internal welfare of each country  what bridges  roads 
canals  and other useful public works and institutions  tending to the
common felicity  might have been made and established with the money
and men foolishly spent  during the last seven centuries by our mad
wars in doing one another mischief  you are near neighbors and each
have very respectable qualities  learn to be quiet and to respect each
other   rights  you are all christians  one is  the most christian
king   and the other  defender of the faith   manifest the propriety
of these titles by your future conduct   by this   says christ   shall
all men know that ye are my disciples  if ye love one another   seek
peace  and insure it 

  adieu  yours

i received my dear friend   kind letter of the 4th instant from bath 
with your proposed temporary convention  which you desire me to show
to my colleagues  they are both by this time in london  where you will
undoubtedly see and converse with them on the subject  the
apprehension you mention  that the cement of the confederation may be
annihilated      has not  i think  any foundation  there is sense
enough in america to take care of their own china vase  i see much in
your papers about our divisions and distractions  but i hear little of
them from america  and i know that most of the letters  said to come
from there with such accounts  are mere london fictions  i will
consider attentively the proposition abovementioned  against the
return of my colleagues  when i hope our commission will have arrived 

i rejoice to hear that your dear sister   recovery advances  and that
your brother is well  please to present my affectionate respects to
them  and believe me ever yours

  sir 

enclosed is a copy of my last  which went by the english packet  i
heard after i wrote it  that the french packet putting back by
contrary winds  mr thaxter had an opportunity of getting on board her 
and that she sailed the 26th of september 

the mentioned new commission is not yet come to hand  mr hartley is
not returned  and i hear will stay for the meeting of parliament 
which is to be the 11th instant  and he will not come hither till the
recess for the christmas holidays  mr jay went to england about three
weeks since on some personal affairs  and mr adams followed last week
to see that country  and take some exercise during this vacancy of
business 

this court is now at fontainbleau  but will return to versailles in a
few days  its good disposition towards us continues  the late failure
of payment in the caisse   escompte  an institution similar to the
bank of england  occasioned partly by its having gone too far in
assisting the government with money  and the inability of the
government to support their credit  though extremely desirous of doing
it  is a fresh proof that our not obtaining a further loan was not
occasioned by want of good will to assist us  as some have unjustly
supposed  but by a real want of the means  money is at present
unaccountably scarce here  what is arrived and expected in spain since
the peace it is thought will set things right  the government has
proposed a second lottery for this year  by which they borrow
twentyfour millions  and it is filled readily  this helps  and the
caisse   escompte goes on again with its operations  but it is said
the interest paid by the lottery plan is nearly seven per cent 

i have received the duplicates of your excellency   letter  of the
15th of july  to the commissioners  which is very satisfactory 
though it came to hand but lately  the first sent  via new york  has
not yet appeared  i have sent copies of it to the hague and madrid 
the substance is published in several papers 

i have acquainted the minister of sweden  that i have received the
ratification of the treaty  and he has written to me that he shall be
in town in a few days  when he will make the exchange  the conclusion
of the danish treaty waits only for the commission and instructions
from congress  the ambassador of portugal informed me lately  that his
court had our proposed plan under consideration  and that we should
soon hear from them  i sent it to congress by barney  and hear the
ship is arrived  a commission and instructions will be wanting for
that also  should the congress be disposed to conclude a treaty with
that nation 

i see by the public prints  that the congress have ratified the
contract i made with the minister here  respecting the loans and aids
we had received  but the ratification itself  though directed to be
sent me  has never come to hand  and i am often asked for it  i beg it
may be forwarded by the first opportunity 

there has been with me lately    pierre du calvet  a merchant of
montreal  who  when our army was in canada  furnished our generals and
officers with many things they wanted  taking their receipts and
promissory notes for payment  and when the english repossessed the
country  he was imprisoned  and his estate seized  on account of the
services he had rendered us  he has shown me the originals of his
papers  which i think are genuine  he produced also a quantity of
congress paper  which he says he received in payment for some of the
supplies  and which appeared to me of our first emissions  and yet
all fresh and clean  as having passed through no other hands  when he
was discharged from prison  he could not obtain permission to go into
the united states to claim the debt  but was allowed to go to england 
and from thence he came hither to solicit payment from me  having no
authority to meddle with such debts  and the sum being considerable  i
refused  and advised him to take passage for america  and make his
application to congress  he said he was grown old  much broken and
weakened by near three years  imprisonment  and that the voyage from
canada to london had like to have been too much for him  he being sick
all the way  so that he could not think of another  though distressed
for want of his money  he appears an honest man  and his case a hard
one  i have therefore undertaken to forward his papers  and i beg
leave to recommend them to the speedy consideration of congress  to
whom i request you would be pleased to present my dutiful respects 
and assure them of my most faithful services 

with great esteem and regard

  sir 

on the 15th of july last  i had the honor to acquaint your excellency
of my arrival in europe  and that i was appointed by his majesty  the
emperor of morocco  bearer of the answer to the congress  sovereign of
the thirteen united states of north america  and that according to my
instructions  i was to meet at paris the ambassador  that would be
appointed by the congress  to sign at the court of morocco the treaty
of peace and commerce  agreeably to the proposals made to his imperial
majesty  by robert montgomery  in his letter dated at alicant  the 4th
of january  1783  since i have been at the court of madrid  where i
had some commissions from the emperor  and to see the execution of
them  i came to this place  from whence i intend to embark in three or
four months for barbary  unless in the meantime i should receive an
answer from your excellency  with orders  that mr richard harrison
should give me for my travelling charges fifteen hundred hard dollars 
although the courts of europe are accustomed to allow the ministers of
my master at the rate of ten pounds sterling per day  while they are
in europe  to defray their expenses  besides presents for their good
offices in those important affairs 

his imperial majesty was graciously pleased at my solicitation to
agree at the request of congress  to grant them a treaty of peace 
 which other powers in europe could not obtain but after many years 
and my return  without the full execution of his commands  i apprehend
may forever indispose him against the united provinces 

  i remain most truly  sir

  my dear friend 

i am much concerned to find by your letter to my grandson  that you
are hurt by my long silence  and that you ascribe it to a supposed
diminution of my friendship  believe me  that is by no means the
case  but i am too much harassed by a variety of correspondence 
together with gout and gravel  which induce me to postpone doing what
i often fully intend to do  and particularly writing  where the urgent
necessity of business does not seem to require its being done
immediately  my sitting too much at the desk having already almost
killed me  besides  since mr jay   residence here  i imagined he might
keep you fully informed of what was material for you to know  and i
beg you to be assured of my constant and sincere esteem and affection 

i do not know whether you have been informed  that a mr montgomery 
who lives at alicant  took upon himself   for i think he had no
authority   to make overtures last winter in behalf of our states 
towards a treaty with the emperor of morocco  in consequence of his
proceedings i received a letter in august  from a person who
acquainted me  that he was arrived in spain by the emperor   order 
and was to come to paris  there to receive and conduct to morocco the
minister of congress appointed to make that treaty  intimating at the
same time an expectation of money to defray his expenses  i
communicated the letter to mr jay  the conduct of mr montgomery
appeared to us very extraordinary and irregular  and the idea of a
messenger from morocco coming to paris to meet and conduct a minister
of congress appearing absurd and extravagant  as well as the demand of
money by a person unknown  i made no answer to the letter  and i know
not whether mr jay made any to mr montgomery  who wrote about the same
time  but i have lately received another letter from the same person 
a copy of which i enclose  together with my answer open for your
perusal  and it is submitted to your discretion whether to forward it
or not  the mr  crocco   who writes to me  having been  as he says  at
madrid  you possibly may know more of him than i can  and judge
whether he is really a person in credit with the emperor  and sent as
he pretends to be  or not rather an  escroc   as the french call
cheats and impostors 

i would not be wanting in anything proper for me to do towards keeping
that prince in good humor with us  till the pleasure of congress is
known  and therefore would answer mr crocco if he be in his employ 
but am loth to commit myself in correspondence with a  fripon   it
will be strange if  being at madrid  he did not address himself to
you 

with great and unalterable regard  i am ever  my dear friend  yours
most affectionately

  sir 

i have just received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me
the 25th past  i did indeed receive your former letter of july  but
being totally a stranger to the mentioned proceedings of mr
montgomery  and having no orders from congress on the subject  i knew
not how to give you any satisfactory answer  till i should receive
further information  and i communicated your letter to mr jay 
minister of the united states for spain  in whose district mr
montgomery is  and who is more at hand than i am for commencing that
negotiation 

mr jay  who is at present in england  has possibly written to you 
though his letter may have miscarried  to acquaint you  that mr
montgomery had probably no authority from congress to take the step he
has done  and that it was not likely that they  desiring to make a
treaty with the emperor  would think of putting his majesty to the
trouble of sending a person to paris to receive and conduct their
minister  since they have ships  and could easily land him at cadiz 
or present him at one of the emperor   ports  we have  however 
written to congress  acquainting them with what we had been informed 
of the good and favorable disposition of his imperial majesty  to
enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states  and
we have no doubt but that  as soon as their affairs are a little
settled  which  by so severe a war carried on in the bowels of their
country  by one of the most powerful nations of europe  have
necessarily been much deranged  they will readily manifest equally
good dispositions  and take all the proper steps to cultivate and
secure the friendship of a monarch  whose character i know they have
long esteemed and respected

                    to the president of congress 

                                           passy  december 25th  1783 

  sir 

not having heard of the appointment of a new secretary for foreign
affairs  i take the liberty of addressing this despatch directly to
your excellency  i received by captain barney a letter from the late
president  directed to the commissioners  dated november the 1st  with
a set of instructions  dated the 29th of october  a resolution of the
same date respecting hamburg  and another of the 1st of november 
relating to captain paul jones  all which will be duly regarded 

captain jones  in passing through england  communicated these papers
to mr adams then at london  mr adams  disappointed in not finding
among them the commission we had been made to expect  empowering us to
make a treaty of commerce with england  wrote to me  that he imagined
it might be contained in a packet that was directed to me  and
requested to be immediately informed  adding  that in case no such
commission was come he should depart directly for holland  so i
suppose he is now there  mr laurens is gone to england  with an
intention of embarking soon for america  mr jay is at bath  but
expected here daily  the english ministers  the duke of manchester and
mr hartley  are both at present in parliament  as soon as either of
them returns  we shall endeavor to obtain an additional article to the
treaty  explaining that mentioned in the instructions 

the affairs of ireland are still unsettled  the parliament and
volunteers are at variance  the latter are uneasy  that in the late
negotiations for a treaty of commerce between england and america  the
british ministers had made no mention of ireland  and they seem to
desire a separate treaty of commerce between america and that kingdom 

it was certainly disagreeable to the english ministers  that all their
treaties for peace were carried on under the eye of the french court 
this began to appear towards the conclusion  when mr hartley refused
going to versailles  to sign there with the other powers our
definitive treaty  and insisted on its being done at paris  which we
in good humor complied with  but at an earlier hour  that we might
have time to acquaint count de vergennes before he was to sign with
the duke of manchester 

the dutch definitive treaty was not then ready  and the british court
now insists on finishing it either at london or the hague  if 
therefore  the commission to us  which has been so long delayed  is
still intended  perhaps it will be well to instruct us to treat either
here or at london  as we may find most convenient 

the treaty may be conducted  even there  in concert and in the
confidence of communication with the ministers of our friends  whose
advice may be of use to us 

with respect to the british court  we should  i think  be constantly
upon our guard  and impress strongly upon our minds  that though it
has made peace with us  it is not in truth reconciled either to us  or
to its loss of us  but still flatters itself with hopes  that some
change in the affairs of europe  or some disunion among ourselves  may
afford them an opportunity of recovering their dominion  punishing
those who have most offended  and securing our future dependence  it
is easy to see by the general turn of the ministerial newspapers 
 light things  indeed  as straws and feathers  but like them they show
which way the wind blows  and by the malignant improvement their
ministers make  in all the foreign courts  of every little accident or
dissension among us  the riot of a few soldiers at philadelphia  the
resolves of some town meetings  the reluctance to pay taxes      all
which are exaggerated  to represent our government as so many
anarchies  of which the people themselves are weary  and the congress
as having lost its influence  being no longer respected  i say it is
easy to see from this conduct  that they bear us no good will  and
that they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine  they
have  too  a numerous royal progeny to provide for  some of whom are
educated in the military line  in these circumstances we cannot be too
careful to preserve the friendships we have acquired abroad  and the
union we have established at home  to secure our credit by a punctual
discharge of our obligations of every kind  and our reputation by the
wisdom of our councils  since we know not how soon we may have a fresh
occasion for friends  for credit  and for reputation 

the extravagant misrepresentations of our political state in foreign
countries  made it appear necessary to give them better information 
which i thought could not be more effectually and authentically done 
than by publishing a translation into french  now the most general
language in europe  of the book of constitutions  which had been
printed by order of congress  this i accordingly got well done  and
presented two copies handsomely bound to every foreign minister here 
the one for himself  the other more elegant for his sovereign  it has
been well taken  and has afforded matter of surprise to many  who had
conceived mean ideas of the state of civilization in america  and
could not have expected so much political knowledge and sagacity had
existed in our wilderness  and from all parts i have the satisfaction
to hear  that our constitutions in general are much admired  i am
persuaded  that this step will not only tend to promote the emigration
to our country of substantial people from all parts of europe  by the
numerous copies i shall disperse  but will facilitate our future
treaties with foreign courts  who could not before know what kind of
government and people they had to treat with  as  in doing this  i
have endeavored to further the apparent views of congress in the first
publication  i hope it may be approved  and the expense allowed  i
send herewith one of the copies 

our treaties with denmark and portugal remain unfinished  for want of
instructions respecting them from congress  and a commission
empowering some minister or ministers to conclude them  the emperor of
morocco  we understand  has expressed a disposition to make a treaty
of amity and commerce with the united states  a mr montgomery  who is
a merchant settled at alicant  has been  it seems  rather forward in
proposing a negotiation  without authority for so doing  and has
embarrassed us a little  as may be seen by some letters i enclose  30 
perhaps it would be well for the congress to send a message to that
prince  expressing their respect and regard for him  till such time as
they may judge it convenient to appoint an ambassador in form 
furnished with proper presents to make a treaty with him  the other
barbary states  too  seem to require consideration  if we propose to
carry on any trade in the mediterranean  but whether the security of
that trade is of sufficient importance to be worth purchasing  at the
rate of the tributes usually exacted by those piratical states  is a
matter of doubt  on which i cannot at present form a judgment

i shall immediately proceed  in pursuance of the first instruction  to
take the proper steps for acquainting his imperial majesty of germany
with the dispositions of congress  having some reason to believe the
overture may be acceptable  his minister here is of late extremely
civil to me  and we are on very good terms  i have likewise an
intimate friend at that court 

with respect to other powers  it seems best not to make advances at
present  but to meet and encourage them when made  which i shall not
fail to do  as i have already done those of sweden  denmark  and
portugal  possibly hamburg  to whom i have forwarded the letter of
congress  may send a minister to america if they wish for a treaty to
conclude it there  they have no minister here 

i have lately received a memorial from the minister of denmark 
respecting a ship of that nation  the providentia  taken by one of our
privateers and carried into boston  i enclose a copy of it  and
request to be furnished with directions and informations for the
answer  it may be well to send me a copy of the proceedings in the
courts  from a perusal of the papers communicated with it  i am
satisfied that the cargo was clearly british property 

we have hitherto entered into no engagements respecting the armed
neutrality  and  in obedience to the fifth instruction  we shall take
care to avoid them hereafter  the treaty between this court and the
united states for regulating the powers  privileges      of consuls 
is at length completed  and is transcribing in order to be signed  i
hope to transmit a copy by the next packet  i have received the
congress ratification of the two money treaties  which will be soon
exchanged  when i shall send copies of them with that of sweden 

i have given  and shall continue to give  captain paul jones all the
assistance in my power  towards recovering the prize money  and i hope
it may soon be accomplished 

when mr jay returns  i shall desire him to make the inquiry directed
in the fourth instruction  respecting the expedition under that
commodore  and report thereon to congress  in the meantime i can
answer respecting one of the questions  that the king paid the whole
expense  and that no part of it has ever been placed to the account of
congress  there exists indeed a demand of one puchelberg  a person in
the employ of    schweighauser  of about thirty thousand livres  for
provisions and other things furnished to captain landais  after he
took the alliance out of the hands of captain jones  but as the ship
was at that time under the king   supply  who having borrowed her for
the expedition when fitted for sea  and just ready to sail with mr
adams  had ordered her to be delivered in the same condition  free of
all charges accrued  or accruing  by her being in holland and in
  orient  and as    puchelberg had not only no orders from me to
furnish captain landais  but acted contrary to my orders given to   
schweighauser  and contrary to the orders of    schweighauser himself 
i refused to pay his account  which besides appeared extravagant  and
it has never yet been paid 

i shall do my best in executing the third instruction  respecting our
claim upon denmark  i have written to london to obtain if possible an
account of the sums insured upon the ships delivered up  as such an
account may be some guide in the valuation of the prizes 

a captain williams  formerly in the british service  and employed upon
the lakes  has given me a paper containing information of the state of
the back country  as those informations may possibly be of some use  i
send herewith the paper  mr carmichael has sent me the accounts of the
money transactions at madrid  as soon as mr jay returns they will be
examined 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  and assure them
of my most faithful services 

with great esteem and regard i have the honor to be

  sir 

the remissness of our people in paying taxes is highly blameable  the
unwillingness to pay them is still more so  i see in some resolutions
of town meetings  a remonstrance against giving congress a power to
take  as they call it   the people   money  out of their pockets 
though only to pay the interest and principal of debts duly
contracted  they seem to mistake the point  money justly due from the
people is their creditor   money  and no longer the money of the
people  who if they withhold it should be compelled to pay by some
law  all property indeed  except the savage   temporary cabin  his
bow  his matchuat  and other little acquisitions absolutely necessary
for his subsistence  seems to me to be the creature of public
convention  hence the public has the right of regulating descents  and
all other conveyances of property  and even of limiting the quantity
and uses of it  all the property that is necessary to a man for the
conservation of the individual  and the propagation of the species  is
his natural right  which none can justly deprive him of  but all
property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public 
who by their laws have created it  and who may therefore by other laws
dispose of it whenever the welfare of the public shall desire such
disposition  he that does not like civil society on these terms  let
him retire and live among the savages  he can have no right to the
benefits of society  who will not pay his club towards the support of
it 

the marquis de lafayette  who loves to be employed in our affairs  and
is often very useful  has lately had several conversations with the
ministers and persons concerned in forming new regulations  respecting
the commerce between our two countries  which are not yet concluded  i
thought it therefore well to communicate to him a copy of your letter 
which contains so many sensible and just observations on that subject 
he will make a proper use of them  and perhaps they may have more
weight  as appearing to come from a frenchman  than they would have if
it were known  that they were the observations of an american  i
perfectly agree with you in all the sentiments you have expressed on
this occasion 

i am sorry for the public   sake  that you are about to quit your
office  but on personal considerations  i shall congratulate you  for
i cannot conceive of a more happy man  than he who having been long
loaded with public cares finds himself relieved from them  and
enjoying private repose in the bosom of his friends and family 

with sincere regard and attachment  i am ever  dear sir  yours

  sir 

if the congress should think it fit to have a consul for the united
states in london  and do not appoint one of our own countrymen to that
office  i beg leave to mention the merits of mr william hodgson  a
merchant of that city  who has always been a zealous friend of
america  was a principal promoter of the subscription for the relief
of american prisoners  and chairman of the committee for dispensing
the money raised by that subscription  he also took the trouble of
applying the monies i furnished him with  when the subscription was
exhausted  and constantly assisted me in all the negotiations i had
with the british ministers  in their favor  wherein he generally
succeeded  being a man of weight and credit  very active  and much
esteemed for his probity and integrity  these his services  continued
steadily during the whole war  seem to entitle him to the favorable
notice of congress  when any occasion offers of doing him service or
pleasure 

with great respect  i have the honor to be

  my dear friend 

will you be so good as to transmit the enclosed to mr jay  i am sorry
that we are going to lose him from this side of the atlantic  if your
american ratification should arrive speedily  i might hope to have the
pleasure of seeing him again before his departure  as soon as i hear
from you of the arrival of your ratification i will immediately apply
for the despatch of the british ratification  i wish very much to have
the pleasure of conversing with you again  in hopes that that time may
come soon  i have nothing further to say at present  believe me always
to be  what you have always known me to have been  a friend of general
philanthropy  and particularly your ever  most affectionate

                                                              hartley

  sir 

i received a few days since a letter from annapolis  dated june the
5th  in your hand writing  but not signed  acquainting the
commissioners with the causes of delay in sending the ratification of
the definitive treaty  the term was expired before that letter came to
hand  but i hope no difficulty will arise from a failure in a point
not essential  and which was occasioned by accidents  i have just
received from mr hartley a letter on the subject  of which i enclose a
copy 

we have had a terrible winter  too  here  such as the oldest men do
not remember  and indeed it has been very severe all over europe 

i have exchanged ratifications with the ambassador of sweden  and
enclose a copy of that i received from him 

mr jay is lately returned from england  mr laurens is still there  but
proposes departing for america next month  as does also mr jay  with
his family  mr adams is in holland  where he has been detained by
business and bad weather  these absences have occasioned some delays
in our business  but not of much importance 

the war long expected between the turks and russians is prevented by a
treaty  and it is thought an accommodation will likewise take place
between them and the emperor  everything here continues friendly and
favorable to the united states  i am pestered continually with numbers
of letters from people in different parts of europe  who would go to
settle in america  but who manifest very extravagant expectations 
such as i can by no means encourage  and who appear otherwise to be
very improper persons  to save myself trouble  i have just printed
some copies of the enclosed little piece  which i purpose to send
hereafter in answer to such letters 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  and believe me
to be  with sincere esteem  dear sir

  sir 

in my last i acquainted your excellency  that mr hartley was soon
expected here to exchange ratifications of the definitive treaty  he
is now arrived  and proposes to make the exchange this afternoon  i
shall then be enabled to send a copy  enclosed is the new british
proclamation respecting our trade with their colonies  it is said to
be a temporary provision  till parliament can assemble and make some
proper regulating law  or till a commercial treaty shall be framed and
agreed to  mr hartley expects instructions for planning with us such a
treaty  the ministry are supposed to have been too busy with the new
elections  when he left london  to think of those matters 

this court has not completed its intended new system for the trade of
their colonies  so that i cannot yet give a certain account of the
advantages that will in fine be allowed us  at present it is said we
are to have two free ports  tobago and the mole  and that we may carry
lumber and all sorts of provisions to the rest  except flour  which is
reserved in favor of bordeaux  and that we shall be permitted to
export coffee  rum  molasses  and some sugar  for our own
consumption 

we have had under consideration a commercial treaty proposed to us by
the king of prussia  and have sent it back with our remarks to mr
adams  who will i suppose transmit it immediately to congress  those
planned with denmark and portugal wait its determination 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the congress  and believe
me to be  with sincere and great esteem  sir

 may 13th   i now enclose a copy of the ratification of the definitive
treaty  on the part of his britannic majesty

  sir 

i have the honor to inform you  that i have transmitted to london the
ratification on the part of congress of the definitive treaty of
peace  between great britain and the united states of america  and i
am ordered to represent to you  that a want of form appears in the
first paragraph of that instrument  wherein the united states are
mentioned before his majesty  contrary to the established custom in
every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic are parties  it is
likewise to be observed  that the term definitive  articles  is used
instead of definitive  treaty   and the conclusion appears likewise
deficient  as it is neither signed by the president  nor is it dated 
and consequently  is wanting in some of the most essential points of
form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument 

i am ordered to propose to you  sir  that these defects in the
ratification should be corrected  which might very easily be done 
either by signing a declaration in the name of congress for preventing
the particular mode of expression  so far as it relates to precedency
in the first paragraph  being considered as a precedent to be adopted
on any future occasion  or else by having a new copy made out in
america  in which these mistakes should be corrected  and which might
be done without any prejudice arising to either of the parties from
the delay 

i am  sir  with great respect and consideration     

                                                        david hartley

                                                 passy  june 2   1784 

  sir 

i have considered the observations you did me the honor of
communicating to me  concerning certain inaccuracies of expression 
and supposed defects of formality  in the instrument of ratification 
some of which are said to be of such a nature as to affect the
validity of the instrument 

the first is   that the united states are named before his majesty 
contrary to the established custom observed in every treaty in which a
crowned head and a republic are the contracting parties   with respect
to this  it seems to me we should distinguish between that act in
which both join  to wit  the treaty  and that which is the act of each
separately  the ratification  it is necessary  that all the modes of
expression in the joint act should be agreed to by both parties 
though in their separate acts each party is master of  and alone
unaccountable for its own mode  and  on inspecting the treaty  it will
be found that his majesty is always regularly named before the united
states  thus   the established custom  in treaties  between crowned
heads and republics   contended for on your part  is strictly
observed  and the ratification following the treaty contains these
words   now know ye  that we  the united states in congress assembled 
having seen and considered the definitive articles aforesaid  have
 approved    ratified   and  confirmed   and by these presents do
 approve    ratify   and  confirm  the said articles  and every part
and clause thereof       hereby all those articles  parts  and
clauses  wherein the king is named before the united states  are
 approved    ratified   and  confirmed   and this solemnly under the
signature of the president of congress  with the public seal affixed
by their order  and countersigned by their secretary 

no declaration on the subject more determinate or more authentic can
possibly be made or given  which  when considered  may probably induce
his majesty   ministers to waive the proposition of our signing a
similar declaration  or of sending back the ratification to be
corrected in this point  neither appearing to be really necessary  i
will  however  if it be still desired  transmit to congress the
observation  and the difficulty occasioned by it  and request their
orders upon it  in the meantime i may venture to say  that i am
confident there was no intention of affronting his majesty by their
order of nomination  but that it resulted merely from that sort of
complaisance  which every nation seems to have for itself  and of that
respect for its own government  customarily so expressed in its own
acts  of which the english among the rest afford an instance  when in
the title of the king they always name great britain before france 

the second objection is   that the term definitive  articles  is used
instead of definitive  treaty   if the words  definitive treaty  had
been used in the ratification instead of  definitive articles   it
might have been more correct  though the difference seems not great
nor of much importance  as in the treaty itself it is called the
present  definitive treaty  

the other objections are   that the conclusion likewise appears
deficient  as if is neither signed by the president  nor is it dated 
and consequently is wanting in some of the most essential points of
form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument  
the situation of seals and signatures  in public instruments  differs
in different countries  though all equally valid  for when all the
parts of an instrument are connected by a ribband  whose ends are
secured under the impression of the seal  the signature and seal
wherever placed are understood as relating to and authenticating the
whole  our usage is  to place them both together in the broad margin
near the beginning of the piece  and so they stand in the present
ratification  the concluding words of which declare the intention of
such signing and sealing to be giving authenticity to the whole
instrument  viz    in testimony  whereof  we have  caused  the seal of
the united states to be hereunto affixed  witness his excellency
thomas mifflin  esquire  president   and the date supposed to be
omitted  perhaps from its not appearing in figures  is nevertheless to
be found written in words at length  viz   this fourteenth day of
january  in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred
eightyfour   which made the figures unnecessary 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be

  sir 

my letter by mr jay acquainted your excellency  that the ratifications
of the definitive treaty were exchanged  a copy of the british part
was also sent by him 

mr hartley remained here expecting instructions to treat with us on
the subject of commerce  the bustle attending a new election and
meeting of parliament  he imagined might occasion the long delay of
those instructions  he now thinks that the affair of the american
trade  being under the consideration of parliament  it is probable no
treaty will be proposed till the result is known  mr jay  who sailed
for america the first instant from dover  and who saw there several of
our friends from london before his departure  and mr laurens who left
london the 6th to go on in the falmouth packet  will be able to give
you more perfect informations than i can  of what may be expected as
the determination of the british government respecting our intercourse
with their islands  and  therefore  i omit my conjectures  only
mentioning  that from various circumstances there seems to be some
lurking remains of ill humor there  and of resentment against us 
which only wants a favorable opportunity to manifest itself 

this makes it more necessary for us to be upon our guard  and prepared
for events  that a change in the affairs of europe may produce  its
tranquillity depending  perhaps  on the life of one man  and it being
impossible to foresee in what situation a new arrangement of its
various interests may place us  ours will be respected in proportion
to the apparent solidity of our government  the support of our credit 
the maintenance of a good understanding with our friends  and our
readiness for defence  all which i persuade myself will be taken care
of 

enclosed i send a copy of a letter from mr hartley to me  respecting
some supposed defects in the ratification  together with my answer 
which he has transmitted to london  the objections appeared to me
trivial and absurd  but i thought it prudent to treat them with as
much decency as i could  lest the ill temper should be augmented 
which might be particularly inconvenient  while the commerce was under
consideration  there has not yet been time for mr hartley to hear
whether my answer has been satisfactory  or whether the ministers will
still insist on my sending for an amended copy from america  as they
proposed 

i do not perceive the least diminution in the good disposition of this
court towards us  and i hope care will be taken to preserve it 

the marquis de lafayette  who will have the honor of delivering this
to you  has  ever since his arrival in europe  been very industrious
in his endeavors to serve us and promote our interests  and has been
of great use on several occasions  i should wish the congress might
think fit to express in some proper manner their sense of his merit 

my malady prevents my going to versailles  as i cannot bear a carriage
upon pavement  but my grandson goes regularly on court days to supply
my place  and is well received there  the last letters i have had the
honor of receiving from you  are of the 14th of january 

  with great respect  i am  sir

instructions of congress to their late commissioners for treating of
peace  expressing their desire to cultivate the friendship of his
imperial majesty  and to enter into a treaty of commerce for the
mutual advantage of his subjects and the citizens of the united
states  which i request you will be pleased to lay before his majesty 
the appointing and instructing commissioners for treaties of commerce

been long delayed  but is now done  and i have just received advice

adams  our minister in holland  and myself  for that service  is on
his way hither  and may be expected by the end of august  when we

  sir 

i have received the letter you did me the honor to write to me this
morning  and i shall lose no time to transmit the contents to my
court 

the sentiments of the emperor towards the united states of america
make me foresee the satisfaction  which his majesty will have to enter
into reciprocal  suitable  and advantageous connexions with them  i
have not the least doubt but that measures will be instantly taken on
this subject to concert with you  sir  and with the appointed
ministers plenipotentiary  and as soon as the answer from my court

  sir 

you have communicated to me an extract from the instructions  which
congress addressed to you on the 11th of may last  which imports that
the united states will in no case treat any other nation with respect
to commerce more advantageously than the french  this disposition is
much the wisest  as it will prevent those misunderstandings  which
might arise from the equivocal terms in which the 2  article of the
treaty of amity and commerce  signed february 6th  1778  is conceived 
but that the resolution of congress on this subject may be clearly
stated  it would be best  sir  that you furnish me with it in the form
of a declaration  or at least in an official note  signed by yourself 
i have no doubt that you will adopt one of these two forms 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i have the honor to transmit to your excellency  by order of congress 
a resolution of theirs  dated the 11th of may last  which is in the
words following  viz 

  resolved   that doctor franklin be instructed to express to the
court of france  the constant desire of congress to meet their wishes 
that these states are about to form a general system of commerce  by
treaties with other nations  that  at this time  they cannot foresee
what claim might be given to those nations by the explanatory
propositions from the count de vergennes  on the 2  and 3  articles of
our treaty of amity and commerce with his most christian majesty  but
that he may be assured it will be our constant care to place no people
on more advantageous ground than the subjects of his majesty  

  with great respect  i am

  dear sir 

it was intended by the commissioners to write a joint letter to
congress  but i am afraid the opportunity may be missed  this may
serve to inform you  that propositions of treating have been made by
us to all the powers of europe according to our instructions  and we
are waiting for their answers  there are apprehensions here of a war
between the emperor and holland  but  as the season is not proper for
opening a campaign  i hope the winter will give time for mediators to
accommodate matters  we have not yet heard that mr jay has accepted
the secretaryship of foreign affairs 

i am ever  my dear friend  yours most affectionately

given to    marbois  the commissioners have written a joint letter to
congress  this serves to cover a few papers relative to matters with
which i was particularly charged in the instructions  i shall write to
you fully by the next opportunity  having now only time to add  that i
am  as ever 

  yours most affectionately

        i executed the instructions of october 29th  1783  as soon as
i knew the commissions for treating with the emperor      were issued 
which was not till july  1784  the three letters between the emperor  
minister and me are what passed on that occasion

  sir 

i received by the marquis de lafayette the two letters you did me the
honor of writing to me the 11th and 14th of december  the one
enclosing a letter from congress to the king  the other a resolve of
congress respecting the convention for establishing consuls  the
letter was immediately delivered and well received  the resolve came
too late to suspend signing the convention  it having been done july
last  and a copy sent so long since  that we now expected the
ratification  as that copy seems to have miscarried i now send
another 

i am not informed what objection has arisen in congress to the plan
sent me  mr jefferson thinks it may have been to the part  which
restrained the consuls from all concern in commerce  that article was
omitted  being thought unnecessary to be stipulated  since either
party would always have the power of imposing such restraints on its
own officers  whenever it should think fit  i am  however  of opinion
that this or any other reasonable article or alteration may be
obtained at the desire of congress  and established by a supplement 

permit me  sir  to congratulate you on your being called to the high
honor of presiding in our national councils  and to wish you every
felicity  being with the most perfect esteem

  sir 

   de chaumont  who will have the honor of presenting this line to
your excellency  is a young gentleman of excellent character  whose
father was one of our most early friends in this country  which he
manifested by crediting us with a thousand barrels of gunpowder and
other military stores in 1776  before we had provided any apparent
means of payment  he has  as i understand  some demands to make on
congress  the nature of which i am unacquainted with  but my regard
for the family makes me wish  that they may obtain a speedy
consideration  and such favorable issue as they may appear to merit 

to this end  i beg leave to recommend him to your countenance and
protection  and am  with great respect

express respectfully for me to his majesty  the deep sense i have of

  dear sir 

an old gentleman in switzerland  long of the magistracy there  having
written a book entitled  du gouvernement des moeurs   which is thought
to contain many matters  that may be useful in america  desired to
know of me how he could convey a number of the printed copies  to be
distributed gratis among the members of congress  i advised his
addressing the package to you by way of amsterdam  whence a friend of
mine would forward it  it is accordingly shipped there on board the
van berckel  captain    campbell  there are good things in the work 
but his chapter on the liberty of the press appears to me to contain
more rhetoric than reason 

  with great esteem i am  ever

  sir 

i have learnt with much concern of your retiring  and of your
approaching departure for america  you cannot doubt but that the
regrets  which you will leave  will be proportionate to the
consideration you so justly enjoy 

i can assure you  sir  that the esteem the king entertains for you 
does not leave you anything to wish  and that his majesty will learn
with real satisfaction  that your fellow citizens have rewarded  in a
manner worthy of you  the important services that you have rendered
them 

i beg  sir  that you will preserve for me a share in your remembrance 
and never doubt the sincerity of the interest i take in your
happiness  it is founded on the sentiments of attachment of which i
have assured you  and with which i have the honor to be

  sir 

with respect to my continuing to charge £2500 sterling per annum as my
salary  of which you desire some explanation  i send you  in support
of that charge  the resolution of congress  which is in these words 

 in congress  october 5th  1779  resolved  that each of the ministers
plenipotentiary be allowed at the rate of two thousand five hundred
pounds sterling per annum  and each of their secretaries at the rate
of one thousand pounds sterling per annum  in full for their services
and expenses respectively  that the salary of each of the said
officers be computed from the time of his leaving his place of abode 
to enter on the duties of his office  and be continued three months
after the notice of his recall  

the several bills i afterwards received  drawn on the congress banker 
mr grand  for my salary  were all calculated on that sum  as my
salary  and neither the banker nor myself has received notice of any
change respecting me  he has accordingly  since the drawing ceased 
continued to pay me at the same rate  i have  indeed  heard that a
resolution was passed last year  that the salaries of plenipotentiaries
should be no more than £2000 sterling per annum  but the resolution  i
suppose  can relate only to such plenipotentiaries as should be
afterwards appointed  for i cannot conceive that the congress  after
promising a minister £2500 a year  and when he has thereby been
encouraged to engage in a way of living for their honor  which only
that salary can support  would think it just to diminish it a fifth 
and leave him under the difficulty of reducing his expenses
proportionably  a thing scarce practicable  the necessity of which he
might have avoided  if he had not confided in their original promise 

but the article of salary  with all the rest of my accounts  will be
submitted to the judgment of congress  together with some other
considerable articles i have not charged  but on which i shall expect 
from their equity  some consideration  if  for want of knowing
precisely the intention of congress  what expenses should be deemed
public  and what private  i have charged any article to the public 
which should be defrayed by me  their banker has my order  as soon as
the pleasure of congress shall be made known to him  to rectify the
error  by transferring the amount to my private account  and
discharging by so much that of the public 

  i have the honor to be

i was not apprized  until within a few hours  of the arrangements
which you have made for your departure  had i been informed of it
sooner  i should have proposed to the king to order a frigate to
convey you to your own country  in a manner suitable to the known
importance of the services you have been engaged in  to the esteem you
have acquired in france  and the particular esteem which his majesty
entertains for you 

i pray you  sir  to accept my regrets  and a renewed assurance of the
most entire consideration  with which i have the honor to be  sir 
your very humble and very obedient servant

  sir 

i have the honor to acquaint you  that i left paris the 12th of july 
and  agreeable to the permission of congress  am returned to my own
country  mr jefferson had recovered his health  and was much esteemed
and respected there  our joint letters have already informed you of
our late proceedings  to which i have nothing to add  except that the
last act i did  as minister plenipotentiary for making treaties  was
to sign with him  two days before i came away  the treaty of
friendship and commerce that had been agreed on with prussia  31  and
which was to be carried to the hague  by mr short  there to be signed
by baron thulemeyer on the part of the king  who  without the least
hesitation  had approved and conceded to the new humane articles
proposed by congress  mr short was also to call at london for the
signature of mr adams  who i learnt  when at southampton  was well
received at the british court 

the captain lamb  who  in a letter of yours to mr adams  was said to
be coming to us with instructions respecting morocco  had not
appeared  nor had we heard anything of him  so nothing had been done
by us in that treaty 

i left the court of france in the same friendly disposition towards
the united states  that we have all along experienced  though
concerned to find that our credit is not better supported in the
payment of the interest money due on our loans  which  in case of
another war  must be  they think  extremely prejudicial to us  and
indeed may contribute to draw on a war the sooner  by affording our
enemies the encouraging confidence  that those who take so little care
to pay  will not again find it easy to borrow  i received from the
king  at my departure  the present of his picture set round with
diamonds  usually given to ministers plenipotentiary  who have signed
any treaties with that court  and it is at the disposition of
congress  to whom be pleased to present my dutiful respects 

  i am  with great esteem and regard     

                                                            franklin 

        not caring to trust them to a common conveyance  i send by my
late secretary  who will have the honor of delivering them to you  all
the original treaties i have been concerned in negotiating  that were
completed  those with portugal and denmark continue in suspense

  sir 

i send you enclosed some letters  that have passed between the
secretary of congress and me  respecting three millions of livres 
acknowledged to have been received  before the treaty of february 
1778  as  don gratuit  from the king  of which only two millions are
found in your accounts  unless the million from the farmers general be
one of the three  i have been assured  that all the money received
from the king  whether as loan or gift  went through your hands  and
as i always looked on the million we had of the farmers general to be
distinct from what we had of the crown  i wonder how i came to sign
the contract  acknowledging three millions of gift  when  in reality 
there was only two  exclusive of that from the farmers  and  as both
you and i examined the project of the contract before i signed it  i
am surprised  that neither of us took notice of the error 

it is possible  that the million furnished ostensibly by the farmers 
was in fact a gift of the crown  in which case  as mr thompson
observes  they owe us for the two ship loads of tobacco  which they
received on account of it  i must earnestly request of you to get this
matter explained  that it may stand clear before i die  lest some
enemy should afterwards accuse me of having received a million not
accounted for 

  i am

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write on the
28th of this month  touching the advance of a million  which you say
was made by the farmers general to the united states of america  the
3  of june  1777  i have no knowledge of that advance  what i have
verified is  that the king  by the contract of the 25th of february 
1783  has confirmed the gratuitous gift  which his majesty had
previously made  of the three millions hereafter mentioned  viz  one
million delivered by the royal treasury  the 10th of june  1776  and
two other millions advanced also by the royal treasury  in 1777  on
four receipts of the deputies of congress  of the 17th of january  3 
of april  10th of june  and 15th of october  of the same year  this
explanation will  sir  i hope  resolve your doubt  touching the
advance of the 3  of june  1777  i further recommend to you  sir  to
confer on this subject with    gojard  who ought to be better informed
than we  who had no knowledge of any advances  but those made by the
royal treasury

  sir 

i laid before the count de vergennes the two letters  which you did me
the honor to write  touching the three millions  the free gift of
which the king has confirmed in favor of the united states of america 
the minister  sir  observed that this gift has nothing to do with the
million  which the congress may have received from the farmers general
in 1777  consequently he thinks  that the receipt  which you desire
may be communicated to you  cannot satisfy the object of your view 
and that it would be useless to give you the copy which you desire

  my dear sir 

the letter you honored me with  covered the copies of three letters 
which mr thompson wrote you to obtain an explanation of a million 
which is not to be found in my accounts  i should have been very much
embarrassed in satisfying and proving to him  that i had not put that
million in my pocket  had i not applied to    durival  who  as you
will see by the answer enclosed  informs me  that there was a million
paid by the royal treasury  on the 10th of june  1776  this is the
very million about which mr thompson inquires  as i have kept an
account of the other two millions  which were also furnished by the
royal treasury  viz  the one million in january and april  1777  the
other in july and october of the same year  as well as that furnished
by the farmers general in june  1777 

here then are the three millions exactly  which were given by the king
before the treaty of 1778  and that furnished by the farmers general 
nothing then remains to be known  but who received the first million
in june  1776  it could not be myself  as i was not charged with the
business of congress until january  1777  i therefore requested of   
durival a copy of the receipt for the one million  you have the
answer  which he returned to me  i wrote to him again  renewing my
request  but as the courier is just setting off  i cannot wait to give
you his answer  but you will receive it in my next  if i obtain one 

in the meanwhile  i beg you will receive the assurances of the
sentiments of respect  with which i have the honor to be  my dear sir

  sir 

i have laid before the count de vergennes  as you seemed to desire 
the letter which you did me the honor to write yesterday  the minister
persists in the opinion  that the receipt  the copy of which you
request  has no relation to the business with which you were intrusted
on behalf of congress  and that this piece would be useless in the new
point of view in which you have placed it  indeed  sir  it is easy
for you to prove  that the money in question was not delivered by the
royal treasury into your hands  as you did not begin to be charged
with the business of congress until january  1777  and the receipt for
that money is of the 10th of june  1776 

i have the honor to be  with perfect attachment  sir

  sir 

i hazard a letter in hopes it may be able to join that of the 9th at
  orient  in order to forward to you the answer i have just received
from    durival  you will there see  that notwithstanding my entreaty 
the minister himself refuses to give me a copy of the receipt which i
asked for  i cannot conceive the reason for this reserve  more
especially since  if there has been a million paid  he who has
received it has kept the account  and it must in time be known  i
shall hear with pleasure  that you have been more fortunate in this
respect in america than i have been in france  and i repeat to you the
assurance of the sentiments of regard  with which i have the honor to
be     

                                                                grand 

                                                   

                        to charles thompson 

                                     philadelphia  january 27th  1787 

  dear friend 

you may remember  that in the correspondence between us in june last 
on the subject of a million  free gift  of the king of france 
acknowledged in our contract to have been received  but which did not
appear to be accounted for in our banker   accounts  unless it should
be the same with the million said to be received from the
farmers general  i mentioned  that an explanation might doubtless be
easily obtained by writing to mr grand  or mr jefferson  i know not
whether you have accordingly written to either of them  but being
desirous that the matter should speedily be cleared up  i wrote myself
to mr grand a letter upon it  of which i now enclose a copy  with his
answers  and several letters from    durival  32  who is  chef du
bureau des fonds   and has under his care the finance   des affaires
etrangeres  

you will see by these letters  that the million in question was
delivered to somebody  on the 10th of june  1776  but it does not
appear to whom  it is clear  however  that it could not be to mr
grand  nor to the commissioners from congress  for we did not meet in
france till the end of december  1776  or beginning of january  1777 
and that banker was not charged before with our affairs 

by the minister   reserve in refusing him a copy of the receipt  i
conjecture it must be money advanced for our use  to    de
beaumarchais  and that it is a  mystère du cabinet   which perhaps
should not be further inquired into  unless necessary to guard against
more demands than may be just from that agent  for it may well be
supposed  that if the court furnished him with the means of supplying
us  they may not be willing to furnish authentic proofs of such a
transaction  so early in our dispute with britain  pray tell me  has
he dropped his demands  or does he still continue to worry you with
them 

i should like to have these original letters returned to me  but you
may if you please keep copies of them  it is true the million in
question makes no difference in your accounts with the king of france 
it not being mentioned or charged  as so much lent and to be repaid 
but stated as freely given  yet  if it was put into the hands of any
of your agents  or ministers  they ought certainly to account for it 
i do not recollect whether mr deane had arrived in france before the
10th of june  1776  33  but from his great want of money  when i
joined him a few months after  i hardly think it could have been paid
to him  possibly mr jefferson may obtain the information  though mr
grand could not  and i wish he may be directed to make the inquiry  as
i know he would do it directly  i mean if  by hortalez and co  
further demands  or for any other reason  such an inquiry should be
thought necessary  34 

  i am

   33  deane did not arrive in paris till the first week in july 

   34  this matter was not cleared up till 1794  when gouverneur morris
  was american minister in paris  by application to the government he
  procured a copy of the receipt of the person  who received the million
  of francs on the tenth of june  1776  it proved to be beaumarchais  as
  dr franklin had conjectured  see  pitkin   history of the united
  states   vol  i     422 

                                                   

                     to the president of congress 

                                    philadelphia  november 29th  1788 

  sir 

when i had the honor of being the minister of the united states at the
court of france  mr barclay arriving there  brought me the following
resolution of congress 

 resolved  that a commissioner be appointed by congress  with full
power and authority to liquidate  and  finally to settle   the
accounts of all the servants of the united states  who have been
intrusted with the expenditure of public money in europe  and to
commence and prosecute such suits  causes  and actions  as may be
necessary for that purpose  or for the recovery of any property of the
said united states in the hands of any person  or persons  whatsoever 

 that the said commissioner be authorised to appoint one or more
clerks  with such allowance as he may think reasonable 

 that the said commissioner and clerks  respectively  take an oath
before some person duly authorised to administer an oath  faithfully
to execute the trust reposed in them respectively 

 congress proceeded to the election of a commissioner  and ballots
being taken  mr    barclay was elected  

in pursuance of this resolution  and as soon as mr barclay was at
leisure from more pressing business  i rendered to him all my
accounts  which he examined  and stated methodically  by his statement
he found a balance due me on the 4th of may  1785  of 7 533 livres  19
sols  3 den  which i accordingly received of the congress banker  the
difference between my statement and his being only seven sols  which
by mistake i had overcharged  about three pence halfpenny sterling 

at my request  however  the accounts were left open for the
consideration of congress  and not finally settled  there being some
articles on which i desired their judgment  and having some equitable
demands  as i thought them  for extra services  which he had not
conceived himself empowered to allow  and therefore i did not put them
in my account  he transmitted the accounts to congress  and had advice
of their being received  on my arrival at philadelphia  one of the
first things i did was to despatch my grandson  william    franklin 
to new york  to obtain a final settlement of those accounts  he having
long acted as my secretary  and being well acquainted with the
transactions  was able to give an explanation of the articles  that
might seem to require explaining  if any such there were  he returned
without effecting the settlement  being told that it could not be made
till the arrival of some documents expected from france  what those
documents were  i have not been informed  nor can i readily conceive 
as all the vouchers existing there had been examined by mr barclay 
and i  having been immediately after my arrival engaged in the public
business of this state  waited in expectation of hearing from
congress  in case any part of my accounts had been objected to 

it is now more than three years that those accounts have been before
that honorable body  and  to this day  no notice of any such objection
has been communicated to me  but reports have  for some time past 
been circulated here  and propagated in the newspapers  that i am
greatly indebted to the united states for large sums  that had been
put into my hands  and that i avoid a settlement  this  together with
the little time one of my age may expect to live  makes it necessary
for me to request earnestly  which i hereby do  that the congress
would be pleased  without further delay  to examine those accounts 
and if they find therein any article or articles  which they do not
understand or approve  that they would cause me to be acquainted with
the same  that i may have an opportunity of offering such explanations
or reasons in support of them as may be in my power  and then that the
accounts may be finally closed 

i hope the congress will soon be able to attend to this business for
the satisfaction of the public  as well as in condescension to my
request  in the meantime  if there be no impropriety in it  i would
desire that this letter  together with another 35  relating to the
same subject  the copy of which is hereto annexed  may be put upon
their minutes 

with every sentiment of respect and duty to congress  i am  sir     

                                                             franklin

  the

  correspondence

  of

  john adams 


  one of the commissioners to france  minister
  plenipotentiary to holland  and one of the
  commissioners for negotiating the
  treaty of peace 




john adams was a delegate in the first continental congress  and one
of the most active  zealous  and efficient members of that body  for
three years his labors in congress were incessant  and of the most
valuable kind  it is said of him  that he belonged to more committees
than any other individual  and he discharged the duties of each with
remarkable promptness and energy 

the foreign affairs of the united states having assumed an important
aspect  mr adams was appointed a commissioner to france in the place
of silas deane  who had been recalled  this appointment took place on
the 28th of november  1777  and in the following february he embarked
from boston  after a long and disagreeable passage of fortyfive days
he arrived in france  here he devoted himself to the duties of his
mission  in conjunction with his colleagues  till dr franklin was
appointed minister plenipotentiary to the court of france  and the
commission was dissolved  having no longer any charge to execute in
europe  mr adams left paris on the 8th of march  1779  for nantes 
where he proposed to embark for his own country  various accidents and
unexpected causes of delay kept him there till the 14th of june  when
he sailed in the french frigate  the sensible  in company with    de
la luzerne  who was coming to the united states in the character of
minister plenipotentiary  as successor to    gerard  the french
government had voluntarily proffered to mr adams a passage in this
vessel  after his disappointment in not sailing in the american
frigate alliance  as he at first expected  the sensible arrived in
boston on the 3  of august 

but he was not long allowed to remain a spectator only of public
events  on the 27th of september he was again chosen by congress to
represent his country abroad  as minister plenipotentiary for
negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with great
britain  when that nation should be found in a humor to recognise the
independence of the united states  and enter into bonds of friendship 
a task more honorable  momentous  and difficult could not have awaited
him  nor one bearing more emphatical testimony of the confidence of
his countrymen in his wisdom  abilities  integrity  and patriotism  on
this second mission he sailed in the same frigate  which had brought
him from france  accommodations for this purpose having been offered
to congress by the french minister in philadelphia  the vessel sprang
a leak on the passage  and the captain was obliged to put into ferrol 
in spain  where he arrived on the 8th of december  from this place 
that he might avoid further hazards and uncertainty of a sea voyage in
the depth of winter  mr adams resolved to proceed by land to the point
of his destination  he reached paris on the 9th of february  1780  the
extreme badness of the travelling at this season had detained him
nearly two months on the road 

by the terms of his commission  the place of his residence was not
prescribed  but for the present he chose to fix himself in paris  as
amicable relations already subsisted between the french court and
congress  and he was instructed to consult the french ministry in
regard to any movements  that might be made in effecting a treaty with
england  he held a correspondence with count de vergennes  respecting
the time and manner of carrying his instructions into execution  and
on other topics  in all of which  however  his opinions and those of
the french minister were somewhat at variance  there seeming no
prospect that great britain would soon be inclined to peace  and mr
adams having no special reasons for remaining at the french court  he
made a tour to holland in the beginning of august  leaving his
secretary  mr dana  in paris 

meantime congress had assigned to him another duty  mr henry laurens
had been appointed  as early as november  1779  to negotiate a loan of
ten millions abroad  but having been prevented by various causes from
departing on this service  congress  on the 20th of june following 
authorised mr adams to engage in the undertaking  and prosecute it
till mr laurens  or some other person in his stead  should arrive in
europe  this commission reached paris four weeks after he had left
that city  and mr dana proceeded with it to holland  efforts were
immediately made to procure a loan in that country  which were for a
long time ineffectual  but which at last succeeded 

mr laurens sailed for holland in august  1780  but was captured a few
days afterwards by a british frigate  which conveyed him to
newfoundland  whence he was sent to england and imprisoned in the
tower  when this intelligence reached congress  it was resolved to
transfer his appointment to another person  and on the 29th of
december mr adams was commissioned to negotiate a treaty of amity and
commerce with the united provinces  and he was furnished with separate
letters of credence as minister plenipotentiary to the states general
and to the prince of orange  the state of parties in holland  and
particularly the influence of england there  rendered unavailing all
advances of the american minister towards a treaty 

it having been intimated to mr adams  by the duc de la vauguyon 
french ambassador in holland  that a treaty of peace was in prospect
through the mediation of russia and austria  and that count de
vergennes would be glad to see him on the subject at versailles  he
set off for paris on the 6th of july  1781  he had several interviews
with the count de vergennes  and a correspondence of some length 
after remaining three weeks at paris and versailles  without
perceiving any apparent indications  that this project for a
negotiation would come to maturity  he returned again to holland 

on the 14th of june congress appointed four other commissioners  in
conjunction with mr adams  to negotiate a treaty of peace  namely 
benjamin franklin  john jay  henry laurens  and thomas jefferson  and
the first commission of mr adams for this purpose was annulled 

a misunderstanding having grown up between england and the united
provinces  chiefly on account of the part taken by the latter in
joining the northern powers to carry into operation the plan of the
armed neutrality  the french court thought it a good opportunity for
the united states to seek a treaty of alliance with holland  this step
was accordingly recommended to congress through the french minister at
philadelphia  and  in consequence of this suggestion  new powers were
conferred on mr adams  dated august the 16th  by which he was
commissioned to negotiate a treaty of alliance with holland  limited
in duration to the continuance of the war with england  and
conformable to the treaties then subsisting with france 

the political relations between the several provinces of holland were
such  however  that the process of negotiation went on heavily and
slowly  the english interest still continued strong  even after the
war had begun  and embarrassments of various kinds were thrown in the
way  which required no common share of sagacity  firmness  and
perseverance to overcome  all these at length yielded  and on the 8th
of october  1782  a treaty of commerce between the united states and
holland  and a convention concerning recaptures  were signed at the
hague 

dr franklin and mr jay had now been for three or four months actively
engaged in the negotiation of peace at paris  having thus brought
affairs to a happy issue in holland  mr adams hastened to join the
commissioners  and arrived in paris before the end of october  from
that time till the preliminary articles were signed  november the
30th  he applied himself unremittingly with his colleagues to the
details of the negotiation  he also took part in the discussions
respecting the definitive treaty  which followed from time to time 
and was one of the signers of that instrument 

in the winter of 1784 he was in holland  in january  1785  he was
appointed the first american minister plenipotentiary to the court of
st james    while in england  he wrote his defence of the american
constitutions  in the year 1788 permission was granted him to return
home  where he arrived after an absence of almost nine years  during
the whole of which period he had been employed in services of the
highest responsibility and importance  he was shortly afterwards
elected vice president of the united states  under the first
presidency of washington

  dear sir 

with great pleasure to ourselves we discharge our duty  by enclosing
to you your commission for representing these united states at the
court of france  we are by no means willing to admit a thought of your
declining this important service  and therefore we send duplicates of
the commission  and the late resolves  in order that you may take one
set with you  and send the other by another vessel 

these are important papers  and therefore we wish they may be put into
the hands of a particular and careful person  with directions to
deliver them himself into the hands of the commissioners  mr hancock 
before he left this place  said that he intended to send a gentleman
to france on some particular business  cannot we prevail to get this
gentleman to undertake the delivery of our packet to the
commissioners  they paying the expense of travel to paris  and back
again to his place of business 

it is unnecessary to mention the propriety of directing these
despatches to be bagged with weight proper for sinking them  on any
immediate prospect of their otherwise falling into the enemy   hands 

we sincerely wish you a quick and pleasant voyage  being truly your
affectionate friends 

                                                                  lee

  sir 

having been absent on a journey  i had not the honor of receiving your
letters until yesterday  when one  of the 28th of november  enclosing
a resolution of congress of the same day  and another of the 3  of
december  enclosing a commission for dr franklin  dr lee  and myself 
to represent the united states at the court of france  were delivered
to me in boston 

as i am deeply penetrated with a sense of the high honor  which has
been done me in this appointment  i cannot but wish i were better
qualified for the important trust  but as congress are perfectly
acquainted with all my deficiencies  i conclude it is their
determination to make the necessary allowances  in the humble hope of
which  i shall submit my own judgment to theirs  and devote all the
faculties i have  and all that i can acquire  to their service 

you will be pleased to accept of my sincere thanks  for the polite
manner in which you have communicated to me the commands of congress 
and believe me to be  with the most perfect respect and esteem     

                                                           john adams

of december 3   until the 22   when it was delivered to me with its
enclosures  viz  a letter from the president to the navy board at
boston  and a private letter of december 8th  from mr lovell  at the
same time  i received a packet directed to benjamin franklin  arthur

  dear sir 

i have never yet paid my respects to you since my arrival in europe 
for which seeming neglect of duty  the total novelty of the scenes
about me  and the incessant avocations of business  and ceremony  and
pleasure   for this last  i find in europe  makes an essential part of
both the other two   must plead my excuse 

the situation of the general affairs of europe is still critical and
of dubious tendency  it is still uncertain whether there will be war
between the turks and the russians  between the emperor and the king
of prussia  and indeed between england and france  in the opinion of
many people  my own conjecture  however  is that a war will commence 
and that soon 

before this reaches you  you will be informed that a strong squadron
of thirteen capital ships and several frigates has sailed from toulon 
and that another squadron is ordered to sail from spithead  whatever i
may have heard of the destination of the first  i am not at liberty to
mention it  we have no intelligence that the latter has sailed 

chatham the great is no more  but there is so much of his wild spirit
in his last speech yet left in the nation  that i have no doubt but
the administration will put all to the hazard 

we are happy to hear by the frigate  la sensible  which has returned
to brest  that the treaty arrived safe at casco bay  we hope to have
the earliest intelligence of the ratification of it  the commissioners
from england  of the 22  of april  will meet  as we suppose  with
nothing but ridicule  the king of prussia is yet upon the reserve
concerning america  or rather forgetting his promise  has determined
not to acknowledge our independence at present  his reason is obvious 
he wants the aid of those very german princes  who are most
subservient to great britain  who have furnished her with troops to
carry on the war against us  and  therefore  he does not choose to
offend them by an alliance with us at present  spain is on the reserve
too  but there is not the least doubt entertained here of her
intention to support america  in holland there is more friendship for
us than i was aware of before i came here  at least  they will take no
part against us 

our affairs in this kingdom i find in a state of confusion and
darkness  that surprises me  prodigious sums of money have been
expended  and large sums are yet due  but there are no books of
account  nor any documents from whence i have been able to learn what
the united states have received as an equivalent 

there is one subject which lies heavily on my mind  and that is the
expense of the commissioners  you have three commissioners at this
court  each of whom lives at an expense of at least three thousand
pounds sterling a year  i fear at a greater expense  few men in the
world are capable of living at a less expense than i am  but i find
the other gentlemen have expended from three to four thousand a year
each  and one of them from five to six  and by all the inquiries i
have been able to make  i cannot find any article of expense which can
be retrenched  36 

the truth is  in my humble opinion  our system is wrong in many
particulars 

1  in having three commissioners at this court  one in the character
of envoy is enough  at present  each of the three is considered in the
character of a public minister plenipotentiary  which lays him under
an absolute necessity of living up to this character  whereas  one
alone would be obliged to incur no greater expense  and would be quite
sufficient for all the business of a public minister 

2  in leaving the salaries of these ministers at an uncertainty  you
will never be able to obtain a satisfactory account of the public
monies while this system continues  it is a temptation to live at too
great an expense  and gentlemen will feel an aversion to demanding a
vigorous account 

3  in blending the business of a public minister with that of a
commercial agent  the business of various departments is by this means
so blended  and the public and private expenses so confounded with
each other  that i am sure no satisfaction can ever be given to the
public of the disposition of their interests  and i am very confident 
that jealousies and suspicions will hereafter arise against the
characters of gentlemen  who may  perhaps  have acted with perfect
integrity and the fairest intentions for the public good 

my idea is this  separate the offices of public ministers from those
of commercial agents  37  recall  or send to some other court  all
the public ministers but one at this court  determine with precision
the sum that shall be allowed to the remaining one for his expenses 
for his salary  and for his time  risk  trouble       and when this is
done  see that he receives no more than his allowance  the
inconveniences arising from the multiplicity of ministers and the
complication of business are infinite 

remember me with the most tender affection to my worthy colleagues 
and to all others to whom you know they are due 

  i am your friend and servant 

                                                           john adams 

footnotes 

   36  in another letter  which mr adams afterwards wrote to mr samuel
  adams  he says the account of the commissioners  expenses here given
  is  exaggerated   and  put much too high   owing to his having been
  but a short time in paris  and not being accurately informed on the
  subject  see this letter hereafter  dated february 14th  1779  in the
  present volume 

  by a letter from mr arthur lee  dated may 9th  1778  containing a
  transcript from the banker   books  it appears  that from december 
  1776  to march  1778  a period of fifteen months  silas deane received
  on his private account   20 926  arthur lee   12 749  and dr franklin 
   12 214   see arthur lee   correspondence   vol  ii     159  where the
  above sums are stated in livres  and they are here reduced to dollars
  by the rule practised at that time  of allowing five livres and eight
  sols to the dollar  the fractions are omitted in the reduction  it
  must be observed  that the above payments are not a specification of
  the amounts actually received for the period in question  because the
  commissioners may have had other expenses for which they afterwards
  drew on the banker  but these sums may serve as a tolerably correct
  indication of their expenses  and were probably intended as such by mr
  lee  at this time no fixed salary was allowed  but congress resolved
  that all expenses should be paid  and that such an additional
  compensation should be granted  as might afterwards be deemed
  expedient by congress 

  on the 1st of june  1778  mr lee wrote to congress   i am of opinion 
  with our colleague  mr adams  that it would be better for the public 
  that the appointment of your public ministers were fixed  instead of
  being left at large  and their expenses indefinite  from experience  i
  find the expense of living in that character cannot well be less than
  three thousand pounds sterling a year    13 333  which i believe is as
  little as is allowed to any public minister beyond the rank of
  consul    arthur lee   correspondence   vol  ii     165 

  the original mode of paying ministers abroad continued  however  till
  october 4th  1779  when congress 

   resolved   that each of the ministers plenipotentiary  be allowed at
  the rate of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling   11 111  per
  annum  and each of their secretaries at the rate of one thousand
  pounds sterling   4 444  per annum  in full for their services and
  expenses respectively 

   that the salary of each of the said officers be computed from the
  time of leaving his place of abode to enter on the duties of his
  office  and be continued three months after notice of his recall  
   secret journals   vol  ii     272 

  the salaries continued fixed at the above sums during the remainder of
  the revolution  and till may 7th  1784  when the salary of ministers
  was reduced to  9000  and that of secretaries to  3000 per annum 

   37  dr franklin expresses this opinion very strongly on several
  occasions  and after he was appointed minister plenipotentiary  with
  the duties of commercial agent attached to his office  he repeatedly
  solicited congress to separate these duties  and to leave him in
  charge only of those branches of business  which pertained to him in
  the character of minister  see  franklin   correspondence   vol  iii

  gentlemen 

i find that the american affairs on this side of the atlantic are in a
state of disorder  very much resembling that which is so much to be
regretted on the other  and arising  as i suppose  from the same
general causes  the novelty of the scenes  the inexperience of the
actors  and the rapidity with which great events have succeeded each
other  our resources are very inadequate to the demands made upon us 
which are perhaps unnecessarily increased by several irregularities of
proceeding 

we have in some places two or three persons  who claim the character
of american agents  agent for commercial affairs  and continental
agent  for they are called by all these different appellations  in one
quarter  one gentleman claims the character from the appointment of
mr william lee  another claims it from the appointment of the
commissioners at passy  and a third from the appointment of the
commercial committee of congress  this introduces a triple expense 
and much confusion and delay  these evils have been accidental  i
believe  and unavoidable  but they are evils still  and ought to be
removed 

one person at bordeaux  another at nantes  and a third perhaps at
havre de grace  or dunkirk  would be amply sufficient for all public
purposes  and to these persons all orders from congress  or the
commercial committee  or the commissioners at paris  ought to be
addressed  to the same persons all public ships of war  and all other
ships belonging to the united states  and their prizes  ought to be
addressed  and all orders for the supplies of provisions  clothing 
repairs of vessels      as well as all orders for shipping of
merchandises  or warlike stores for the united states  ought to go
through their hands  we have such abuses and irregularities every day
occurring  as are very alarming  agents of various sorts are drawing
bills upon us  and the commanders of vessels of war are drawing upon
us for expenses and supplies  which we never ordered  so that our
resources will soon fail  if a speedy stop is not put to this career 

and we find it so difficult to obtain accounts from agents of the
expenditure of monies  and of the goods and merchandises shipped by
them  that we can never know the true state of our finances  or when
and in what degree we have executed the orders of congress for sending
them arms  clothes  medicines  or other things 

in order to correct some of the abuses  and to bring our affairs into
a little better order  i have constantly given my voice against
paying for things we never ordered  against paying persons who have
never been authorised  and against throwing our affairs into a
multiplicity of hands in the same place  but the consequence has been
so many refusals of demands and requests  that i expect much
discontent will arise from it  and many clamors  whether the
appointment by congress of one or more consuls for this kingdom would
remedy these inconveniences  i must submit to their wisdom 

  i have the honor to be

  my dear friend 

i had yesterday the honor of receiving the despatches from congress 
which were sent by the saratoga from baltimore  arrived at nantes 
convoyed in by the boston  captain tucker   who was returning from a
short cruise  and who has sent in four prizes   and those by the spy 
from new london  arrived at brest  and the inexpressible pleasure of
your private letters by the same vessels  you acquaint me  that you
had written to me eight or nine times  which has given me some
anxiety  as these letters are the first i have received from you or
from any member of congress  since my arrival in france 

the ratification of the treaty gives universal joy to this court and
nation  who seem to be sincerely and deeply rejoiced at this connexion
between the two countries 

there is no declaration of war as yet at london or versailles  but the
ships of the two nations are often fighting at sea  and there is not
the smallest doubt but war will be declared  unless britain should
miraculously have wisdom given her to make a treaty with the congress
like that which france has made  spain has not made a treaty  but be
not deceived nor intimidated  all is safe in that quarter 

the unforeseen dispute in bavaria has made the empress queen and king
of prussia cautious of quarrelling with great britain  because her
connexion with a number of the german princes  whose aid each of those
potentates is soliciting  makes her friendship  or at least her
neutrality in the german war  of importance to each  but this will do
no hurt to america 

you have drawn so many bills of exchange upon us  and sent us so many
frigates  every one of which costs us a large sum of money  so many
merchandises and munitions of war have been sent  whether arrived or
not  and we expect so many more drafts upon us  that i assure you i am
very uneasy concerning our finances here  we are laboring to hire
money  and have some prospect of success  but i am afraid not for such
sums as will be wanted 

let me entreat you to omit no opportunity of writing me  send me all
the newspapers  journals      and believe me your friend and servant

  my dear friend 

your favors of may 16th and 25th  by captain barnes reached me
yesterday  these  with those by niles from connecticut  and those by
the saratoga from baltimore  are all that i have received from you  or
from anybody at congress  which gives me pain  because your other
letters must have miscarried  and i hold your letters in so high
esteem  that i cannot be willing to lose one 

the robbery of folger   packet  by all that i can learn  must have
been committed by a traitor  who made his escape to england  but dr
franklin and mr lee  who were acquainted with this transaction  will 
i suppose  develope the mystery as far as they are able  one of these
gentlemen has some other suspicions  but i believe the fugitive to
england was the only thief 

mr deane  whom you mention  is no doubt with you before now  but if
the count   estaing has not been able to strike a decisive blow before
the arrival of byron  i should fear that some misfortune has befallen
him since the junction of byron and howe  we are  however  anxious to
know the naval manoeuvres in america  as well as those of the armies 
mr deane complains of ill treatment  and claims great merit for his
services  i shall not add to the ill treatment  nor depreciate the
merit  but it will never do for congress to dread the resentment of
their servants  i have heard a great deal in this country concerning
his conduct  great panegyrics and harsh censures  but i believe he has
neither the extravagant merit that some persons ascribe to him  nor
the gross faults to answer for  which some others impute or suspect  i
believe he was a diligent servant of the public  and rendered it
useful service  his living was expensive  but whether he made the vast
profit to himself that some persons suspect  i know not  or whether
any profit at all  one thing i know  that my family will feel that i
shall not imitate him in this faculty  if it really was his  for which
reason i wish congress would determine  what allowance we shall have
for our time  that i might know whether my family can live upon it or
not 

extravagant claims to merit are always to be suspected  general gates
was the ablest negotiator you ever had in europe  38  and next to him 
general washington   attack upon the enemy at germantown  i do not
know  indeed  whether this last affair had not more influence upon the
european mind than that of saratoga  although the attempt was
unsuccessful  the military gentlemen in europe considered it as the
most decisive proof that america would finally succeed 

and you may depend upon it  although your agents in europe were to
plead with the tongues of men and angels  although they had the
talents and the experience of mazarin  or the integrity of   asset 
your army in america will have more success than they 

i foresee there will be diversities of sentiment concerning this
gentleman   deane   and perhaps warm debates  perhaps there will be as
much as there has been about a general in the northern department  all
that i request is  that i may not be drawn into the dispute  europe
has not charms enough for me to wish to stay here to the exclusion of
abler negotiators  much less at the expense of heat and divisions in
congress  how well united you were in the choice of me i never was
informed  and how soon attempts may be made to displace me i know not 
but one thing i beg of my friends  and one only  that if any attempt
of that kind should be made  they would give me up  rather than
continue my residence at the expense of debates in congress  and by
the favor of small majorities 

if i were capable of speculating in english funds  or of conducting
private trade  i might find opportunities here to make a private
profit  and might have inducements from private considerations to
continue here  but this will never be my case  and i am very well
persuaded that congress will never grant me so much for my services
here  as i could earn by my profession in boston  to which i will
return with submission to old ocean  old boreas  and british men of
war  the moment i am released from this station  i wish however that
congress would determine what allowance they will grant  that honest
men may not be made or suspected otherwise  as to the public  i am
fully persuaded that its interests are not at all concerned in my
residence here  as there is a great plenty of persons quite as well
qualified 

  i am

  sir 

i thank you for your kind congratulations on the favorable appearances
in our american concerns  and for so politely particularizing one of
the most inconsiderable of them  my safe arrival in france  which was
after a very inconvenient passage of fortyfive days 

your letter to mr izard i had the pleasure to send to him immediately
in paris  where he resides  the court of tuscany being so connected
with that of vienna  as to discourage hitherto his departure for
italy  he did me the honor of a visit yesterday  when we had much
conversation upon american affairs 

your other letter to your daughter in law  i have forwarded by a safe
opportunity  you may depend upon my conveying your letters to any of
your friends by the best opportunities  and with despatch  the more of
your commands you send me  the more pleasure you will give me 

war is not declared  that is  no manifesto has been published  but
each nation is daily manufacturing materials for the other  
manifesto  by open hostilities  in short  sir  the two nations have
been at war ever since the recall of the ambassadors  the king of
france has given orders to all his ships to attack the english  and
has given vast encouragement to privateers 

the king of great britain and his council have determined to send
instructions to their commissioners in america to offer us
independency  provided we will make peace with them  separate from
france  this appears to me to be the last effort to seduce  deceive 
and divide  they know that every man of honor in america must receive
this proposition with indignation  but they think they can get the men
of no honor to join them by such a proposal  and they think the men of
honor are not a majority  what has america done to give occasion to
that king and council to think so unworthily of her 

the proposition is in other words this   america  you have fought me
until i despair of beating you  you have made an alliance with the
first power of europe  which is a great honor to your country and a
great stability to your cause  so great that it has excited my highest
resentment  and has determined me to go to war with france  do you
break your faith with that power and forfeit her confidence  as well
as that of all the rest of mankind forever  and join me to beat her 
or stand by neuter and see me do it  and for all this i will
acknowledge your independency  because i think in that case you cannot
maintain it  but will be an easy prey to me afterwards  who am
determined to break my faith with you  as i wish you to do yours with
france  

my dear countrymen  i hope you will not be allured upon the rocks  by
the syren song of peace  they are now playing a sure game  they have
run all hazards  but now they hazard nothing 

i know your application is incessant and your moments precious  and 
therefore  that i ask a great favor in requesting your correspondence 
but the interests of the public  as well as private friendship  induce
me to do it 

  i am

  my dear sir 

the sovereign of britain and his council have determined to instruct
their commissioners to offer you independence  provided you will
disconnect yourselves from france 

the question arises  how came the king and council by authority to
offer this  it is certain that they have it not 

in the next place  is the treaty of alliance between us and france now
binding upon us  i think there is not room to doubt it  for
declarations and manifestos do not make the state of war  they are
only publications of the reasons of war  yet the message of the king
of great britain to both houses of parliament  and their answers to
that message were as full a declaration of war as ever was made  and
accordingly hostilities have been frequent ever since  this proposal 
then  is a modest invitation to a gross act of infidelity and breach
of faith  it is an observation that i have often heard you make  that
 france is the natural ally of the united states   this observation
is  in my opinion  both just and important  the reasons are plain  as
long as great britain shall have canada  nova scotia  and the
floridas  or any of them  so long will great britain be the enemy of
the united states  let her disguise it as much as she will 

it is not much to the honor of human nature  but the fact is certain 
that neighboring nations are never friends in reality  in the times of
the most perfect peace between them  their hearts and their passions
are hostile  and this will certainly be the case forever between the
thirteen united states and the english colonies  france and england 
as neighbors and rivals  never have been and never will be friends 
the hatred and jealousy between the nations are eternal and
irradicable  as we  therefore  on the one hand  have the surest ground
to expect the jealousy and hatred of great britain  so on the other we
have the strongest reasons to depend upon the friendship and alliance
of france  and no one reason in the world to expect her enmity or her
jealousy  as she has given up every pretension to any spot of ground
on the continent  the united states  therefore  will be for ages the
natural bulwark of france against the hostile designs of england
against her  and france is the natural defence of the united states
against the rapacious spirit of great britain against them  france is
a nation so vastly eminent  having been for so many centuries what
they call the dominant power of europe  being incomparably the most
powerful at land  that united in a close alliance with our states  and
enjoying the benefit of our trade  there is not the smallest reason to
doubt  but both will be a sufficient curb upon the naval power of
great britain 

this connexion  therefore  will forever secure a respect for our
states in spain  portugal  and holland too  who will always choose to
be upon friendly terms with powers  who have numerous cruisers at sea 
and indeed in all the rest  of europe  i presume  therefore  that
sound policy as well as good faith will induce us never to renounce
our alliance with france  even although it should continue us for some
time in war  the french are as sensible of the benefits of this
alliance to them as we are  and they are determined as much as we to
cultivate it 

in order to continue the war  or at least that we may do any good in
the common cause  the credit of our currency must be supported  but
how  taxes  my dear sir  taxes  pray let our countrymen consider and
be wise  every farthing they pay in taxes is a farthing   worth of
wealth and good policy  if it were possible to hire money in europe to
discharge the bills  it would be a dreadful drain to the country to
pay the interest of it  but i fear it will not be  the house of
austria has sent orders to amsterdam to hire a very great sum  england
is borrowing great sums  and france is borrowing largely  amidst such
demands for money  and by powers who offer better terms  i fear we
shall not be able to succeed 

pray write me as often as you can  and believe me your friend and
servant

  my dear sir 

your kind favor of july the 1st was brought here yesterday from
bordeaux  where captain ayres has arrived  but was not delivered to me
till this day  this is the second only received from you  i have
infinite satisfaction in learning from all parts of america the
prosperous train of our affairs  and the unanimity and spirit of the
people  every vessel brings us fresh accessions of ardor to the
french  and of depression to the english  in the war that is now begun
in earnest 

the resolutions of congress upon the conciliatory bills  the address
to the people  the ratification of the treaty  the answer to the
commissioners  the president   letter  the message of    livingston 
and the letter of mr drayton  are read here with an avidity that would
surprise you  it is not one of the least misfortunes of great britain 
that she has to contend with so much eloquence  that there are such
painters to exhibit her atrocious actions to the world  and transmit
them to posterity  every publication of this kind seems to excite the
ardor of the french nation  and of their fleets and armies  as much as
if they were americans 

while american orators are thus employed in perpetuating the
remembrance of the injustice and cruelty of great britain towards us 
the french fleet has been giving such a check to her naval pride  as
she has not experienced before for many ages  the vessel  which is to
carry this  will carry information of a general engagement between
  orvilliers and keppel  which terminated in a disgraceful flight of
the english fleet  we hope soon to hear of   estaing   success  which
would demonstrate to the universe  that britain is no longer mistress
of the ocean  but the events of war are always uncertain  and a
misfortune may have happened to the french fleet in america  but even
if this should be the case  which i do not believe  still britain is
not mistress of the sea  and every day will bring fresh proofs that
she is not  the springs of her naval power are dried away 

i have hitherto had the happiness to find that my pulse beat in exact
unison with those of my countrymen  i have ventured with some freedom
to give my opinion  as to what congress would do with the conciliatory
bills  with the commissioners  with the treaty          and every
packet brings us proceedings of congress  according in substance  but
executed in a manner infinitely exceeding my abilities  nothing has
given me more joy  than the universal disdain that is expressed both
in public and private letters  at the idea of departing from the
treaty and violating the public faith  this faith is our american
glory  and it is our bulwark  it is the only foundation on which our
union can rest securely  it is the only support of our credit both in
finance and commerce  it is our sole security for the assistance of
foreign powers  if the british court with their arts could shake it 
or the confidence in it  we should be undone forever  they would
triumph over us  after all our toil and danger  they would subjugate
us more entirely than they ever intended  the idea of infidelity
cannot be treated with too much resentment or too much horror  the man
who can think of it with patience is a traitor in his heart  and ought
be execrated as one  who adds the deepest hypocrisy to the blackest
treason 

is there a sensible hypocrite in america  who can start a jealousy 
that religion may be in danger  from whence can this danger arise  not
from france  she claims no inch of ground upon your continent  she
claims no legislative authority over you  no negative upon your laws 
no right of appointing you bishops  nor of sending you missionaries 
besides  the spirit of crusading for religion is not in france  the
rage for making proselytes  which has existed in former centuries  is
no more  there is a spirit more liberal here in this respect  than i
expected to find  where has been the danger to the religion of the
protestant cantons of switzerland  from an alliance with france  which
has subsisted with entire harmony for one hundred and fifty years  or
thereabouts  but this subject is fitter for ridicule than serious
argument  as nothing can be clearer than that in this enlightened
tolerant age  at this vast distance  without a claim or color of
authority  with an express acknowledgment and warranty of sovereignty 
this  i had almost said tolerant nation  can never endanger our
religion 

the longer i live in europe  and the more i consider our affairs  the
more important our alliance with france appears to me  it is a rock
upon which we may safely build  narrow and illiberal prejudices 
peculiar to john bull  with which i might perhaps have been in some
degree infected when i was john bull  have now no influence over me  i
never was  however  much of john bull  i was john yankee  and such i
shall live and die  is great britain to be annihilated  no such thing 
a revolution in her government may possibly take place  but whether in
favor of despotism or republicanism  is the question  the scarcity of
virtue  and even the semblance of it  seems an invincible obstacle to
the latter  but the annihilation of a nation never takes place  it
depends wholly on herself to determine whether she shall sink down
into the rank of the middling powers of europe  or whether she shall
maintain the second place in the scale  if she continues this war  the
first will be her fate  if she stops short in her mad career and makes
peace  she may still be in the second predicament  america will grow
with astonishing rapidity  and england  france  and every other nation
in europe will be the better for her prosperity  peace  which is her
dear delight  will be her wealth and her glory  for i cannot see the
seed of a war with any part of the world in future  but with great
britain  and such states as may be weak enough  if any such there
should be  to become her allies  that such a peace may be speedily
concluded  and that you and i may return to our farms to enjoy the
fruits of it  spending our old age in recounting to our children the
toils and dangers we have encountered for their benefit  is the wish
of your friend

  my dear sir 

your letter of the 20th of june  by captain ayres  from boston  had a
quick passage  he sailed on the 4th of july  and your letters were
brought to passy from bordeaux  where she arrived the 3  of august 

i thank you  sir  for the kind expressions of your obliging anxiety
for me  the uncertainty in which you remain so long  concerning the
fate of the boston  must have been occasioned by the capture of many
vessels by which the news was sent  together with many bundles of
english newspapers and pamphlets  the prompt ratification of the
treaties  as well as the dignity with which you have received the
letters from the british commissioners  has given great satisfaction
here  the two articles  the count de vergennes agreed  when we
presented your instructions to him on that head  should be given up 

the confederation is an important object  and nothing is more wished
for in europe than its completion  and the finishing of the separate
governments  the eagerness to complete the american code  and the
strains of panegyric in which they speak and write of those parts of
it  which have been published in europe  are very remarkable  and seem
to indicate a general revolution in the sentiments of mankind upon the
subject of government  our currency cannot engage our attention too
much  and the more we think of it  the more we shall be convinced 
that taxation  deep and broad taxation  is the only sure and lasting
remedy  loans in europe will be very difficult to obtain  the powers
at war  or at the eve of war  have such vast demands  and offer terms
so much better than ours  that nothing but sheer benevolence to our
cause can induce any person to lend us  besides a large foreign debt
would be a greater evil  for what i know  than a paper currency 
moreover  your large drafts upon the commissioners here  from various
quarters  are like to consume more money than we can borrow  we shall
do however all we can 

i have hitherto had the good fortune to preserve a good understanding
with the gentleman you mention  and shall endeavor to continue it  i
have long known him to be employed very ably and usefully for our
country  and his merits and services  his integrity and abilities 
will induce me to cultivate his friendship  as far as i can 
consistently with the public service  i wish i could converse with you
freely upon this subject  but it would lead me into too long a detail 
it has given me much grief  since my arrival here  to find so little
harmony among many respectable characters  so many mutual jealousies 
and so much distrust of one another  as soon as i perceived it  i
determined neither to quarrel with any man here  because he had
quarrelled with another  or because another had quarrelled with him 
nor to make any man my bosom friend  because he was the bosom friend
of any other  but to attend solely to the public service  and give my
voice upon all occasions  as i should think that justice and policy
required  whether it agreed with the opinion of one man or another  i
cannot be more particular  if i were to take every man   word  i
should think there was not one disinterested american here  because it
is very certain  that there is nobody here  that everybody speaks well
of  there is no doubt to be made  that private interest has some
influence here upon some minds  and that our mercantile affairs and
competitions have occasioned some altercation  but there is  i think 
rather more of mutual reproaches of interested views and designs 
rather more of animosity among the americans here  than i remember to
have seen anywhere else  i will have nothing to do with any of these
things  i will have nothing to do with designs and endeavors to run
down characters  to paint in odious colors indifferent actions  to
excite or propagate suspicions without evidence  or to foment or
entertain prejudices of any kind  if i can possibly avoid it  i am
really ashamed to write to you in this enigmatical manner  which is
not natural to me  but i know not how to write clearer at present  i
sometimes differ in sentiment from each of my colleagues  and
sometimes agree with each  yet i do not trim  or at least i think i do
not  it has been and shall be my endeavor to heal and reconcile  to
the utmost of my power  yet i fear  that some gentlemen are gone over
to america  heated with altercation and inflamed with prejudice 
others still remain here  it is to be feared  in the same temper of
mind  and probably many letters are gone over loaded  these things
will probably make you uncomfortable  as they have and will make us  i
really wish  however  that you would remove the cause of this  and
appoint consuls to do the mercantile business  if you do not  however 
i am determined to go on  giving my voice clearly and without
equivocation  and at the same time without wrangling or ill will 

we expect on sunday  the 9th  the english accounts of the sea fight
between   orvilliers and keppel  which happened on the 27th ult  in
which the former obtained the laurels  whatever representation the
latter may make of it  there are so many facts  attested by so many
respectable witnesses  that there is no room to doubt  but that the
britons lost the day  a terrible loss indeed to a nation  who have the
empire of the sea to maintain  in order almost to preserve their
existence  it is not being equal to france at sea  they must support a
clear and decided superiority  not only to france  but to france and
spain in conjunction  not to mention our states  in order to preserve
their rank among the powers of europe  my tenderest respects to all
good men

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the last gazettes  by which congress will
see the dearth of news in europe at present  we expect an abundance of
it at once soon  as we have nothing from america since the 4th of
july 

the french fleet went out again from brest the 17th  but we have not
yet heard that the english fleet is out  while the two fleets were in
the harbor  the british east india fleet  and another small west india
fleet  got in  a misfortune of no small moment  as the british
finances will receive by means of it a fresh supply of money for the
present  and their fleet a considerable reinforcement of seamen 

i have the honor to be  with the highest respect

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress all the newspapers i have by
me  enough to show that we have nothing very important here at
present  the french and british fleets are again at sea  and we hourly
expect intelligence of a second battle  but our expectations from
america are still more interesting and anxious  having nothing from
them since the 3  of july  except what is contained in the english
gazettes 

events have probably already passed in america  although not known in
europe  which will determine the great question  whether we shall
have a long war or a short one  the eyes of all europe are fixed upon
spain  whose armaments by sea and land are vastly expensive and
extremely formidable  but whose designs are a profound  impenetrable
secret  time  however  will discover them  in the meantime  we have
the satisfaction to be sure  that they are not inimical to america 
for this  we have the word of a king  signified by his ministers  a
king  who they say never breaks his word  but  on the contrary  has
given many striking proofs of his sacred regard to it 

i have the honor to be  with the greatest esteem

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the latest gazettes  we have
no other intelligence  than is contained in them 

since the 11th of july  the date of lord howe   announcing the arrival
of the count   estaing off sandy hook  we have not a syllable from
america  by the way of england  in france  we have nothing from
america since july 3   this long interval leaves a vast scope for
imagination to play  and  accordingly  there is no end to the
speculations prompted by the hopes and fears of the nations of europe 
we are weary of conjectures  and must patiently wait for time to end
them

  sir 

as our finances are  at present  in a situation seriously critical 
and as i hold myself accountable to congress for every part of my
conduct  even to the smallest article of my expenses  i must beg the
favor of you to consider what rent we ought to pay you for this house
and furniture  both for the time past and to come  every part of your
conduct towards me  and towards our americans in general  and in all
our affairs  has been polite and obliging  as far as i have had an
opportunity of observing  and i have no doubt it will continue so  yet
it is not reasonable  that the united states should be under so great
an obligation to a private gentleman  as that two of their
representatives should occupy  for so long a time  so elegant a seat 
with so much furniture and so fine accommodations without any
compensation  and in order to avoid the danger of the disapprobation
of our constituents on the one hand  for living here at too great or
at too uncertain an expense  and on the other  the censure of the
world for not making sufficient compensation to a gentleman  who has
done so much for our convenience  it seems to me necessary that we
should come to an eclaircissement upon this head 

as you have an account against the commissioners  or against the
united states  for several other matters  i should also be obliged to
you  if you would send it in as soon as possible  as every day renders
it more and more necessary for us to look into our affairs with the
utmost precision 

i am  sir  with much esteem and respect  your most obedient  humble
servant

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write to me
on the 15th inst  making inquiry as to the rent of my house  in which
you live  for the past and the future  when i consecrated my house to
dr franklin  and his associates  who might live with him  i made it
fully understood that i should expect no compensation  because i
perceived that you had need of all your means to send to the succor of
your country  or to relieve the distresses of your countrymen escaping
from the chains of their enemies  i pray you  sir  to permit this
arrangement to remain  which i made when the fate of your country was
doubtful  when she shall enjoy all her splendor  such sacrifices on my
part will be superfluous  or unworthy of her  but  at present  they
may be useful  and i am most happy in offering them to you 

there is no occasion for strangers to be informed of my proceeding in
this respect  it is so much the worse for those  who would not do the
same if they had the opportunity  and so much the better for me  to
have immortalized my house by receiving into it dr franklin and his
associates 

i have the honor to be  sir  with the most perfect respect

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the latest gazettes  which contain all the
news of europe  the news from america by the way of london  which are
contained in the  courier de   europe  of the 15th instant  have
raised our expectations and increased our anxiety  we are not without
apprehensions  that the count   estaing may fall in with the combined
fleets of howe and byron 

the english are beginning to elevate their heads a little  and to
renew their old insolent language  both in coffee houses and in daily
papers  the refugees from america  unable to bear the thought of being
excluded forever from that country  and still less that of soliciting
for pardon from their injured countrymen  and returning to see
established principles  which they detest  and forms of government 
against which they have ever combated  are said to be indefatigable in
instilling hopes into the king and ministers  that by persevering
another campaign  and sending twenty thousand more men to america  the
people will be worn out  and glad to petition for dependence upon
them 

they flatter themselves and others with hopes  that spain will remain
neuter  and that by intriguing in france  they can get the french
ministry changed  and then that they shall have little trouble from
this quarter  nothing can be more whimsical  more groundless or
ridiculous  than all this  yet it is said to amuse and please the
credulous multitude in that devoted island  those  who pretend to know
the bosoms of the persons highest in power in that kingdom  say  that
they delight themselves with the thought  that if it is not in their
power to reduce america once more to their yoke  yet they are able to
harass  to distress  and to render miserable those whom they cannot
subdue  that they have some little compunction at the thought  that
they shall be ranked in history with the philips and alvas  the
alberts and gislers of this world  but this  instead of producing
repentance and reformation as it ought  engenders nothing but rage 
envy  and revenge  this revenge  however  is impotent  their marine
and their finances are in so bad a condition  that it is with infinite
difficulty they can cope with france alone  even at sea  and it seems
to be the intention of providence  that they shall be permitted to go
on with their cruelties  just long enough to wean the affection of
every american heart  and make room for connexions between us and
other nations  who have not the ties of language  of acquaintance  and
of custom to bind us 

i am  with the most perfect respect  sir  your most obedient  humble
servant

  sir 

i have received with much pleasure your favor of yesterday   date  no
apology was necessary for the delay of so few days to answer a letter 
the contents of which did not  from any public consideration  require
haste  my most fervent wishes mingle themselves with yours  that the
happy time may soon arrive when we may enjoy the blessings of peace 
uninterrupted by disputes with any power whatever  but alas  my
apprehensions are very strong  that we are yet at a distance from so
great a felicity 

you will readily acknowledge the impropriety of my entering into the
question concerning the duty of the commissioners here  to have made
the communications of the treaty  which you mention  but of this you
may be assured  that i shall at all times hold myself obliged to you
for the communication of your sentiments upon any public affair  i am
therefore sorry  that in your letter you have confined yourself to
that part of the treaty  upon which i particularly requested your
sentiments  and i now take the liberty to request your sentiments upon
every part of the treaty  which you conceive liable to doubtful
construction  or capable of producing discontent or dispute  for i
have the honor to be fully of your opinion  that it is of very great
importance to be upon our guard  and avoid every cause of controversy
with france as much as possible  she is  and will be  in spite of the
obstacles of language  of customs  religion  and government  our
natural ally against great britain as long as she shall continue our
enemy  and that will be at least as long as she shall hold a foot of
ground in america  however she may disguise it  and whatever peace or
truce she may make 

your sentiments of the fishery  as a source of wealth  of commerce and
naval power  are perfectly just  and therefore this object will and
ought to be attended to with precision  and cherished with care 
nevertheless  agriculture is the most essential interest of america 
and even of the massachusetts bay  and it is very possible to injure
both  by diverting too much of the thoughts and labor of the people
from the cultivation of the earth to adventures upon the sea  and
this  in the opinion of some persons  has been a fault in the
massachusetts bay  experience has taught us in the course of this war 
that the fishery was not so essential to our welfare as it was once
thought  necessity has taught us to dig in the ground instead of
fishing in the sea for our bread  and we have found that the resource
did not fail us 

the fishery was a source of luxury and vanity  that did us much
injury  yet this was the fault of the management  not of the fishery 
one part of our fish went to the west india islands for rum  and
molasses to be distilled into rum  which injured our health and our
morals  the other part went to spain and portugal for gold and silver 
almost the whole of which went to london  sometimes for valuable
articles of clothing  but too often for lace and ribands  if 
therefore  the cessation of the fishery for twenty years to come was
to introduce the culture of flax and wool  which it certainly would do
as far as would be necessary for the purposes of decency and comfort 
if a loss of wealth should be the consequence of it  the acquisition
of morals and of wisdom would perhaps make us gainers in the end 

these are vain speculations i know  the taste for rum and ribands will
continue  and there are no means for the new england people to obtain
them so convenient as the fishery  and therefore the first opportunity
will be eagerly embraced to revive it  as a nursery of seamen  and a
source of naval power  it has been  and is an object of serious
importance  and perhaps indispensably necessary to the accomplishment
and the preservation of our independence  i shall therefore always
think it my duty to defend and secure our rights to it with all
industry and zeal  and shall ever be obliged to you for your advice
and co operation 

pardon the length of this letter  and believe me  with much esteem 
your friend and servant

  sir 

i have the pleasure of yours of the 28th  and agree with you in
sentiment  that if the money  which has heretofore been squandered
upon articles of luxury  could for the future be applied to discharge
our national debt  it would be a great felicity  but is it certain
that it will  will not the national debt itself be the means  at least
a temptation to continue  if not increase the luxury  it is with great
pleasure that i see you mention sumptuary laws  but is there room to
hope that our legislatures will pass such laws  or that the people
have  or can be persuaded to acquire those qualities  that are
necessary to execute such laws  i wish your answer may be in the
affirmative  and that it may be found true in fact and experience  but
much prudence and delicacy will be necessary  i think  to bring all
our countrymen to this just way of thinking upon this head  there is
such a charm to the human heart in elegance  it is so flattering to
our self love to be distinguished from the world in general by
extraordinary degrees of splendor  in dress  in furniture  equipage 
buildings      and our countrymen  by their connexion with europe  are
so much infected with the habit of this taste and these passions  that
i fear it will be a work of time and difficulty  if not quite
impracticable  to introduce an alteration  to which the late condition
of our trade and currency  besides the great inequality of fortune 
and the late enterprises introduced by privateers  are dangerous
enemies 

you ask my opinion  whether the reasons in your last letter are well
founded  it is observable  that the french court were not content
with the treaty proposed by congress  which contained all  in my
opinion  which is contained in the article as it now stands in the
treaty of the 6th of february  what motive they had for inserting the
words   indefinite and exclusive   is left to conjecture  39  the
suspicion  that they meant more than the treaty proposed by congress
expressed  arises from a fact  which you remember  viz  that the
french at the time of the last peace claimed more  i wish to know if
there is any letter or memorial extant  in which such a claim is
contained  or whether it was only a verbal claim made by their
ambassadors  whether any of the magazines of that time mention and
discuss any such claim  if the fact is incontestible  that they made
such a claim  it is possible that it may be revived under the words
 indefinite and exclusive   but i hope it will not  and i hope it was
not intended when these words were inserted  yet i confess i cannot
think of any other reason for inserting them  the word indefinite is
not amiss  for it is a right of catching fish and drying them on land 
which is a right indefinite enough  but the word exclusive is more
mysterious  it cannot mean that americans and all other nations shall
be  excluded  from the same right of fishing and drying on land 
between the same limits of bonavista and riche  it would be much
easier to suppose  that the following words   in that part only  and
in no other besides that   gave rise to the word  exclusive   that is 
that right of fishing and drying within those limits  for which we
have excluded ourselves from all others  i will undertake to show
better reasons  or at least as good  for this sense of the word
exclusive  as the most subtle interpreter of treaties can offer for
the other  although i think them both untenable 

my opinion further is this  that as contemporaneous exposition is
allowed by all writers on the law of nations to be the best
interpreter of treaties  as well as of all other writings  and as
neither the treaty of utrecht  or the treaty of paris in 1763  ever
received such an interpretation as you are apprehensive may hereafter
be contended for  and as the uninterrupted practice has been against
such a construction  so i think that the treaty of paris of the 6th of
february  1778  is not justly liable to such a construction  and that
it cannot be attempted with any prospect of success  i agree with you 
however  that as we are young states  and not practised in the art of
negotiation  it becomes us to look into all these things with as much
caution and exactness as possible  and furnish ourselves with the best
historical light  and every other honest means of securing our rights 
for which reason i requested your sentiments upon this subject in
writing  and continue to desire in the same way your observations on
other parts of the treaty  reduced to writing  such things remain in
letters and letter books  as well as more distinctly in the memory 
and the same men or other men may recur to them at future
opportunities  whereas transient conversations  especially among men
who have many things to do and to think of  slip away and are
forgotten  i shall make use of all the prudence i can  that these
letters may not come to the knowledge of improper persons  or be used
to the disadvantage of our country  or to you or me in our present
capacity 

  i am

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the latest gazettes  by which congress
will perceive  that we have no intelligence from america since the
departure of the count   estaing from sandy hook  our anxiety is very
great  but we hope that a few hours will relieve it  in the midst of a
war in germany  and between france and england  there was scarcely
ever a greater dearth of news in a profound peace 

captain mc neil  the bearer of this  makes the most conversation 
having taken and destroyed  i think  thirteen vessels in the course of
his last cruise  six of which have safely arrived in france  the
others  not destroyed  he sent to america  his cruise will prove a
great disappointment to the enemy  having deprived them of a great
quantity of naval stores  upon which they depended 

i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect

  sir 

while we officially communicate to you the enclosed resolve  the
foundation of which you cannot remain a stranger to  we must entreat
you to be assiduous in sending to those commissioners who have left
france  and gone to the courts for which  they were respectively
appointed  all the american intelligence  which you have greater
opportunity than they of receiving from hence  particularly to mr
izard and mr william lee  we do not often send more than one set of
gazettes by one opportunity  and we hear of several vessels which have
miscarried 

congress must and will speedily determine upon the general arrangement
of their foreign affairs  this is become  so far as regards you 
peculiarly necessary  upon a new commission being sent to dr franklin 
in the meantime we hope you will exercise your whole extensive
abilities on the subject of our finances  the doctor will communicate
to you our situation in that regard 

to the gazettes  and to conversation with the marquis de lafayette  we
must refer you for what relates to our enemies  and close with our
most cordial wishes for your happiness 

  your affectionate friends

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the latest newspapers  as they
contain the speech at the opening of parliament  and some of the
debates in both houses  upon the addresses in answer to it  they are
of very great importance  i learn by some newspapers and private
letters  that an opinion has been prevalent in america  that the enemy
intended to withdraw from the united states  and considering the cruel
devastations of the war  and the unfortunate situation of our
finances  nothing would give me so much joy  as to see reasons to
concur in that opinion  and to furnish congress with intelligence in
support of it  but i am sorry to say the reverse is too apparent  we
may call it obstinacy or blindness  if we will  but such is the state
of parties in england  so deep would be the disgrace  and perhaps so
great the personal danger to those who have commenced and prosecuted
this war  that they cannot but persevere in it at every hazard  and
nothing is clearer in my mind  than that they never will quit the
united states until they are either driven or starved out of them  i
hope  therefore  congress will excuse me for suggesting  that there is
but one course for us to take  which is to concert every measure  and
exert every nerve  for the total destruction of the british power
within the united states

  dear sir 

it is necessary that you should be minutely informed of the minutest
and most secret springs of action here  if it is possible  yet the
danger is so great of our letters being taken  and getting into
english newspapers  that it is very discouraging to a free
correspondence  i will  however  take all the precaution in my power
to have the letters sunk  but if all these fail  and my letters become
public  the world must take them as they find them  and i hope they
will do more good upon the whole than harm 

this court and nation appear to me  to be well convinced of the
utility to their interests of the american alliance  but
notwithstanding this  they appear to me to have too much diffidence of
us  too much diffidence of the people of america  and too much
reserve towards the commissioners here  i am not satisfied in the
cause of this  whether they think  that the obstacles of language 
religion  laws  customs and manners  are obstacles in the way of a
perfect friendship  which cannot be removed  and therefore that they
shall lose our connexion as soon as britain comes to her senses  or
whether they are embarrassed by the conduct of spain  and are acting
in this reserved manner  and with an appearance of irresolution in
hopes of her coming in  or whether they have any prejudices against
the personal characters of the commissioners  and are loth to be
unreserved with them  for fear they shall communicate either
indiscreetly or by design anything to the english  or to anybody here 
who might convey it to england  or whether all these motives together
have a share in it  i know not  thus much is certain  that ever since
i have been here  i have never seen any disposition in any minister of
state to talk with any of the commissioners  either upon intelligence
from spain or england  upon the designs or negotiations of either  or
any other court in europe  or upon the conduct of the war by sea or
land  or upon their own plans or designs of policy or war  if this
reserve was ever thrown off to any one  i should think  that putting
it on to others had some personal motive  but it is exactly equal and
alike to all three 

each commissioner here  before i came  had his own set of friends 
admirers  and dependents  both among the french and americans  two
households united in some degree against one  very unjustly  i fear 
and very impolitically  but this set the friends of the two to
injuring the third in conversation  and they cannot forbear to do it 
to this day  this dissension  i suspect  has made the ministry
cautious  lest in the course of altercations  improper use should be
made of free communications  for my own part  however odd you may
think it in me to say it  i have no friends  much less dependents 
here  and am determined to have none  for i am convinced  that
competitions among these have done the evil  but i am determined  if i
am continued here  to have free communication with the ministry upon
these subjects and to search them to the bottom  the ministry are
candid men and sensible  and i am sure  that some eclaircissements
would do good 

however  i am reckoning without my host  for by the bruits  which mr
deane   letters have scattered  i may expect  that the first vessel
will bring my recall or removal to some other court  but wherever i
am  my heart will ever be anxious for the good of our country  and
warm with friendship for her friends  among whom you will ever be
reckoned in the foremost rank  by your most obedient

  sir 

i have had the honor to enclose to congress the speech at the opening
of the british parliament by several opportunities  but as it opens
the intention of the enemy  and warns us to be prepared for all the
evils  which are in their power to inflict  and not in our power to
prevent  i enclose it again in another form 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect

  dear sir 

from the long series of arduous services in which we have acted
together  i have had experience enough of your accurate judgment  in
cases of difficulty  to wish very often that i could have the benefit
of it here  to me it appears  that there will be no more cordial
friendship  nor for many years to come any long peace between great
britain and america  and therefore the french alliance is and will be
an important barrier to us  and ought to be cultivated with perfect
faith and much tenderness  but still it is a delicate and dangerous
connexion  there is danger to the simplicity of our manners  and to
the principles of our constitution  and there may be danger that too
much will be demanded of us  there is danger  that the people and
their representatives may have too much timidity in their conduct
towards this power  and that your ministers here may have too much
diffidence of themselves  and too much complaisance for the court 
there is danger  that french councils  and emissaries  and
correspondents may have too much influence in our deliberations 

i hope that this court will not interfere  by attaching themselves to
persons  parties  or measures in america  it would be ill policy  but
no court is always directed by sound policy  and we cannot be too much
upon our guard  some americans will naturally endeavor to avail
themselves of the aid of the french influence  to raise their
reputation  to extend their influence  to strengthen their parties 
and in short to promote the purposes of private ambition and
interest  but these things must be guarded against 

i wish for a letter from you as often as you can  and that you would
believe me your friend 

                                                           john adams

                                            passy  december 8th  1778 

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress one other copy of the speech
at the opening of parliament  together with the debates in consequence
of it 

the hints in those debates  especially those given out by lord
suffolk  are confirmed by the general strain of intelligence from
london  letters from persons  who are supposed to know  announce the
determination of the cabinet to be  that clinton and byron  with their
fleet and army  shall ravage the coast  and bombard and pillage the
towns  that their army in canada shall be reinforced  and that parties
of regulars  with such tories and indians as they can persuade to join
them  shall ravage  burn  and massacre on the frontiers of
massachusetts bay  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  virginia and
the carolinas 

their magnificent menaces we know it is not in their power to execute
entirely  yet we may depend they will do as much as they can  they
will neither acknowledge our independence  nor withdraw their fleets
and armies  nor shall we get rid of them  but by destroying them  or
making them prisoners  until the nation is so exhausted  and their
credit so sunk  that the minister can raise no more money 

it has been usual to consider this as a ministerial war  but i have
ever thought  they would some time or other discover it to be a
national war  the few men of the nation  who think seriously of the
business  see clearly in the long train of consequences of american
independence the loss of their west india islands  a great part of
their east india trade  the total loss of canada  nova scotia  the
floridas  all the american fisheries  a diminution of their naval
power  as well as national bankruptcy  and a revolution in their
government in favor of arbitrary power  and the nation in general has
a confused dread of all these things upon its spirits 

the inference they draw from all this is to go on with the war  and
make it more cruel  which is the way in the opinion of impartial
persons to make all their gloomy visions realities  whereas the only
way to prevent them is to make peace now  before a total alteration
takes place on both sides  however  all we can do is to be prepared
for the worst they can do 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect

  sir 

your favors of may 9th and 16th from brest  we duly received  we
congratulate you on your success  and safe arrival at brest  as well
as on the honor you have acquired by your conduct and bravery in
taking one of the king   ships 

as we have some expectation of obtaining an exchange of prisoners from
england  we would advise you to keep those you have made securely
confined  though in a manner most consistent with humanity  till we
have an answer from thence  for if we can get an equal number of our
own seamen to man the drake  she will be an additional strength to you
in a future expedition  whereas sending her with the prisoners to
america  will not only weaken you by the hands you must spare to
navigate her  and to keep the prisoners in subjection  but will also
hazard their being retaken  we should have been happy to have been
early informed of the particulars of your cruise  and of the prizes
you have made  of which we have no authentic advice to this hour 

your bill of exchange in favor of    bussolle for twentyfour thousand
livres  which you inform us you mean to distribute among the brave
officers and men to whom you owe your late success has been presented
to us by    chaumont  we are sorry to inform you  that we have been
under the disagreeable necessity of refusing payment  and that for
several reasons  first  because your application should have been made
to    schweighauser  who is the person regularly authorised to act as
continental agent at brest  and we are determined that all american
concerns  within our department  shall go through his hands  as long
as he shall continue in the character of american agent  or at least
until we shall find it necessary to order otherwise  secondly  because
the bill is drawn for an expense  which we have no right or authority
to defray  we have no authority to make presents of the public money
to officers or men  however gallant and deserving  for the purpose of
providing their families with clothing  or for any other purpose  nor
to advance them money upon the credit of their share of prizes  nor
have we authority to advance them any part of their pay or bounties 
all these things belong to congress alone  and must be done by the
proper boards in america  our authority extends no further than to
order the necessary repairs to be made to your ship  to order her to
be furnished with necessary victuals  which we are ready to order   
schweighauser to do as soon as we shall be informed by you what
repairs and victuals are wanted  with an estimate of the amount of the
expenses 

there is one thing further  which we should venture to do for the
benefit of your men  upon a representation from you of the quantity of
slops necessary for them  we should order    schweighauser to furnish
your ship with them  not more however than one suit of clothes for
each man  that you may take them on board of your ship  and deliver
them out to the men as they shall be wanted  charging each man upon
the ship   books with what he shall receive  that it may be deducted
out of his pay 

lieutenant simpson has stated to us your having put him under arrest
for disobeying orders  as a court martial must  by order of congress 
consist of three captains  three lieutenants  and three captains of
marines  and these cannot be had here  it is our desire that he may
have a passage procured for him by the first opportunity to america 
allowing him whatever may be necessary for his defence  as the
consequences of an arrest in foreign countries are thus extremely
troublesome  they should be well considered before they are made  if
you are in possession of any resolution of congress  giving the whole
of ships of war when made prizes to the captors  we should be obliged
to you for a copy of it  we should also be obliged to you for a
particular account in whose hands the prizes made by you are  and in
what forwardness is the sale of them  we have the honor to be

  sir 

we have received sundry letters from lieutenant simpson  and sundry
certificates from officers and others  concerning his behavior in
general  and particularly upon that occasion in which he is charged
with disobedience of orders  without giving or forming any decided
opinion concerning his guilt or innocence of the crime laid to his
charge  we may venture to say  that the certificates we have received
are very favorable to his character  and at least afford reason to
hope  that he did not mean to disobey his orders  be this however as
it may  we are constrained to say  that his confinement on board of
any other ship than the ranger  and much more his confinement in a
prison on shore  appears to us to carry in it a degree of severity 
which cannot be justified by reason or law  we therefore desire you
would release mr simpson from his imprisonment  and permit him to go
at large upon his parole to go to nantes  there to take his passage to
america by the first favorable opportunity  in order to take his trial
by a court martial 

we request you to transmit to us as soon as possible  an account of
what is due to lieutenant simpson  according to the ship   books  for
wages 

an application has been made to us in behalf of mr andrew fallen  one
of the prisoners lately made by you  and his case represented with
such circumstances as have induced us to request you to let mr fallen
go where he will  after taking his parole in writing  that he will not
communicate any intelligence  which may be prejudicial to the united
states  that he will not take arms against them during the war  and
that he will surrender himself prisoner of war  whenever called upon
by congress  or their ministers at paris  we are  sir

  sir 

we have received several letters from you  and several certificates
from officers and others  respecting your behavior in general  as well
as particularly relative to the charge of disobedience of orders  for
which you have been confined  it would be improper for us to give any
opinion concerning this charge  which is to be determined only by a
court martial  but we have requested captain jones to set you at
liberty upon your parole to go to nantes  there to take your passage
to america by the first favorable opportunity  in order to take your
trial by a court martial  40 

  we are  sir  your humble servants

  gentlemen 

i had yesterday the honor of your favor of the 28th of october 
enclosing a resolution of congress  of the 22  of the same month  to
which i shall give all the attention in my power  41  i have much
satisfaction in the reflection  that i have hitherto endeavored with
much sincerity to conform to the spirit of it  what you recommend to
me  viz  to communicate to the ministers of other courts such
intelligence as i may receive  will not in future be so much in my
power  but as far as i can  while i stay in europe  i shall endeavor
to comply  indeed  it is a long time that we have had no intelligence
to communicate  three vessels we know have been taken  each of which
had many letters  and two of them public despatches  one that sailed
from philadelphia the 4th of november  another that sailed from the
same port the 24th  and another that sailed from boston on the 20th 
these letters and despatches were all sunk  and we fear that others
are lost 

it would be agreeable to me  indeed  if i were able to throw any light
on the subject of finances  as to a loan in europe  all has been done
that was in our power to this end  but without the desired effect 
taxation and economy comprehend all the resources that i can think of 

we expect the honor of a visit from the marquis de lafayette this
morning  whom we shall receive with gratitude for his gallant and
glorious exertions in one of the best causes in which a hero ever
fought 

be pleased to accept my thanks for your kind wishes for my happiness 
and believe me to be your affectionate friend

  my dear sir 

the marquis de lafayette did me the honor of a visit yesterday  and
delivered me your favor of the 25th of october  i am not sorry  as
things have been ordered  that mine of may 24th did not reach you till
the 24th of october  because  as the new arrangement 42  was
previously made  it cannot be said that i had any hand in
accomplishing it  yet i am glad the letter has arrived  because it
will show that the new system is quite agreeable to me  that is  the
appointment of a single minister here  believe me  sir  it was become
very necessary 

footnote 

   42  dissolving the commission in paris  and appointing dr franklin
  minister plenipotentiary 

how congress will dispose of me  i do not know  if it is intended that
i shall return  this will be very agreeable to me  and i think that
this is the most probable opinion  because mr deane    address  was on
the 5th of december  congress soon after resolved to enter on foreign
affairs and go through them  the alliance sailed on the 14th of
january  and there is no resolution arrived here respecting me  i
think  therefore  that it is my duty to return  and that is my present
determination  but whether i shall go to amsterdam  and from thence to
st eustatia  or to spain  and thence home  or in a french man of war
to martinique  or an american frigate to america  i have not decided 
some hint that i am to go to holland  others to spain  this last
implies the removal of mr lee  which would give me much pain on many
accounts  i think him a faithful man and able  yet what the
determination will be upon the complaint of mr deane  i cannot say 
this is a subject which i cannot write or talk about  i would not feel
such another sensation to be made a prince  i confess i expected the
most dismal consequences from it  because i thought it would render
business and confidence between us three totally impracticable  that
it would destroy all confidence between this court and us  and that it
would startle spain  that it would alienate many in holland from us 
and that it would encourage the ministry in england and disconcert
opposition so much  that they would even make another vigorous
campaign  besides all the evils it would produce among you  but the
arrival of dr franklin   commission has relieved me from many of these
fears  this court have confidence in him alone  but i think they were
cautious  even of him  when he had two colleagues  to whom he was
obliged to communicate everything  one of whom was upon as bad terms
with him as with mr deane  i have had a kind of a task here  as mr
lovell expresses himself  determined to be the partizan of neither 
yet to be the friend of both  as far as the service would admit  i am
fixed in these two opinions  that leaving the doctor here alone is
right  and that mr lee is a very honest and faithful man 

you say that france should be our polar star in case war should take
place  i was  i confess  surprised at this expression  was not war
sufficiently declared in the king of england   speech  and in the
answers of both houses  and in the recall of his ambassador  has it
not been sufficiently declared by actual hostilities in most parts of
the world  i suspect there will never be any other declaration of war 
yet  there is in fact as complete a war as ever existed  and it will
continue  for you may depend upon it  the king of france is immovably
fixed in your support  and so are his ministers  every suspicion of a
wavering disposition in this court concerning the support of american
independence is groundless  is ridiculous  is impossible  you may
remember  that several years ago  several gentlemen were obliged to
reason  to show that american independence was the interest of france 
since my arrival in this kingdom  i never yet found one man  nor heard
of more than one  who doubted it  if the voice of popularity is
anything  i assure you that this voice was never so unanimous in
america in favor of our independence as it is here  it is so much so 
that if the court were to depart from its present system in this
respect  it is my clear opinion it would make this nation very
unhappy  and the court too  but i again repeat  that the court is as
fixed as the nation  and this union of sentiment arises out of such
principles in nature  as  without a miracle  cannot alter  common
sense in america supported independence  common sense in france
supports the alliance  and will support it to the last  nay  the
common sense of europe supports the common sense of france 

by the way  my regards to mr paine  and tell him  that i do not agree
with him in his ideas about natural enemies  it is because england is
the natural enemy of france  that america in her present situation is
her natural friend  at least  this is one cause  although there are
many others  some of them are more glorious  for human nature 

france scarcely ever made a war before  that was popular in europe 
there is not a state  that i can hear of  but applauds her  and wishes
her success  and in point of finance and naval strength  and in skill
and bravery of officers  she seems to be superior to england  you may
be surprised to hear me say naval strength  yet if you consider the
wretched state of the british navy  as to masts  yards  rigging  and
men  you will not wonder  although their number of ships may be
superior  i therefore think  that all is safe  we may have further
trouble  and trials of our faith and patience  but trouble is to you
and me familiar  and i begin to think it necessary for my health 

there is one thing in my letter to you exaggerated  the expenses of
the commissioners  i had been here but a short time  and wrote
according to the best guess i could make  from what i had heard  but i
now think i put it much too high  yet i cannot say exactly  43 

 february 20th   there is not the least appearance of the embarkation
of troops for america  nor any intelligence of transports taken up 
the national discontent is great  and tumults have arisen in edinburgh
and london  according to present appearances  they will have occasion
for so many of their troops to keep their populace in order  as to be
able to spare few for america  their proclamations are all alike from
burgoyne   to those of the commissioners  the weaker they are  the
more they puff 

  i am

  sir 

last evening i had the honor of your letter of the 13th of this month 
in answer to mine of the 11th  44 

i thank your excellency for the politeness with which you have agreed
to my proposition  of a conference upon the subject of mr deane  
 address to the people of the united states  

at the time when my letter of the 11th was written and sent to your
excellency  there were three commissioners here  representatives of
congress  between whom it appeared to me mr deane   address had a
tendency to destroy all confidence  as well as between your excellency
and them  for which reason i thought it my duty to endeavor  by a
conference with your excellency  to lessen those evils as far as
should be in my power 

but within a few hours after my letter of the 11th was sent  the
aid de camp of the marquis de lafayette arrived  with despatches from
congress to dr franklin  and from their committee of foreign affairs
to me  informing me of the new arrangement by which dr franklin is
constituted minister plenipotentiary here  and i am restored to the
character of a private citizen  by which  so wholly changed are the
scene and the characters here  that i now think i have no right to do
what  if i had continued in the character of a commissioner  i should
have thought it my indispensable duty to do 

this masterly measure of congress  which has my most hearty
approbation  and of the necessity of which i was fully convinced
before i had been two months in europe  has taken away the
possibilities of those dissensions  which i so much apprehended  i
shall not  therefore  give your excellency any further trouble  than
to take an opportunity of paying my respects in order to take leave 
and to assure you  that i shall leave this kingdom with the most
entire confidence in his majesty   benevolence to the united states 
and inviolable adherence to the treaties between the two powers  with
a similar confidence in the good disposition of his majesty  
ministers of state and of this nation towards us  and with a heart
impressed with gratitude for the many civilities which i have
received  in the short space i have resided here  at brest  in the
city  and in the country  and particularly from your excellency 

  i have the honor to be

  my dear marquis 

the conversation with which you honored me last evening  has induced
me to give you the trouble of this letter upon the same subject 

it is certain that a loan of money is very much needed to redeem the
redundancy of our paper bills  and without it  it is impossible to
foresee what will be the consequence to their credit  and therefore
every service  that may be rendered in order to obtain it from this
kingdom  from spain  or holland  will be a most acceptable service 

but without some other exertions  even a loan perhaps would be but a
temporary relief  with them a smaller loan might suffice  you know
perfectly well  that the enemy in america are at present very weak 
and in great distress in every part  they are weak in canada  weak in
halifax  weak in rhode island  weak in new york  weak in the floridas 
and weak in every one of the west india islands  a strong armament of
ships of the line  with five thousand troops  directed against
halifax  rhode island  or new york  must infallibly succeed  so it
must against the floridas  so it must against canada  or any one of
the west india islands 

you are very sensible  that in this state of weakness  the british
possessions in america depend upon each other for reciprocal support 
the troops and ships derive such supplies of provisions from canada
and nova scotia  that if these places or either of them were lost  it
would be difficult  if not impossible  for the other to subsist  the
west india islands derive such supplies from the floridas  that if
they were lost the others could hardly subsist  their fleets and
armies in canada  halifax  rhode island  new york  and the floridas 
receive supplies of rum  sugar  molasses      from the west india
islands  without which they could scarcely subsist  every part of
their possessions in america  both on the continent and in the
islands  receives constant supplies from europe  from england 
scotland  and ireland  without which they must fall  you perceive 
therefore  that their dominions in america at present form such a
chain  that the links mutually support each other in such a manner 
that if one or two were taken away  the whole  or at least the greater
part  must fall  in this state of things then  the obvious policy is
to send a strong squadron of ships of the line to co operate with the
count   estaing and the american army  in some expedition directed
against new york  rhode island  halifax or perhaps all of them in
course  five or six thousand troops would be quite enough  above all 
it is indispensably necessary to keep a clear naval superiority  both
on the coast of the continent  and in the west islands  this together
with french and american privateers would make such havoc among the
enemy   transports  passing from one of their possessions to another 
as must ruin their affairs  the french have a great advantage in
carrying on this kind of war in america  at present  the british ships
are badly manned and in bad repair  they cannot send them into the
american seas  without the utmost terror for their own coasts  and
when they are in america  they have not such advantages for supplies
of provisions  naval stores      as the french 

the devastation  which was made among their ships of the line 
frigates  transports  and traders  in the american seas the last
summer  shows how much might be done  if a stronger force were sent
there  as long as the enemy have possession of new york and rhode
island  so long it will be necessary for us to keep up large armies 
to watch their motions  and defend the country against them  which
will oblige us to emit more paper  and still further to increase the
depreciation  now as long as they maintain the dominion of those seas 
their troops will be protected by the cannon of their ships  and we
could not dislodge them with an army  however large  at least we could
not keep possession of those places  but if their force was captivated
in those seas  as it might easily be by a sea force  co operating with
the land forces  we might reduce our army and innumerable other
articles of expense  we need not emit any more paper  and that already
out would depreciate no further  i should be happy to have further
conversation with you  sir  upon these subjects  or to explain
anything by letter  which may be in my power 

with the highest sentiments of esteem and respect  i have the honor to
be

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you have done me the honor to write
me on the 16th of this month  although you are to be henceforth
without a public character in france  be persuaded that the esteem and
consideration  which you have justly acquired  are by no means
diminished  and i flatter myself  sir  that you will not deprive me of
the pleasure of assuring you of it by word of mouth  and being at the
same time the interpreter of the favorable sentiments with which the
king honors you  they are the consequence of the particular
satisfaction  which his majesty has received from the wise conduct you
have held during the whole time of your commission  as well as the
zeal you have constantly displayed  both for the cause of your
country  and for the support of the alliance which attaches it to his
majesty 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect

  sir 

i have received the letter  which your excellency did me the honor to
write me on the 21st of this month  this testimony from your
excellency of those indulgent sentiments  with which his majesty is
pleased to honor my sincere intentions  cannot fail to be preserved by
me and my posterity as a most precious monument  and what is of
infinitely more importance  it cannot fail to give great satisfaction
to my country  to find that a servant of theirs  who has been honored
with no small share of their confidence in the most dangerous of
times  and most critical circumstances  has been so happy as not to
forfeit the confidence of their illustrious ally 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

by the new arrangement  which was brought by the marquis de lafayette 
i find myself restored to the character of a private citizen 

the appointment of a single minister at the court of versailles was
not unexpected to me  because i had not been two months in europe
before i was convinced of the policy  and indeed of the necessity  of
such a measure  but i ever entertained hopes  that when the news of
such an alteration should arrive  the path of my own duty would have
been made plain to me by the directions of congress  either to return
home or go elsewhere  but as no information that we have received from
congress has expressed their intentions concerning me  i am obliged to
collect them by implication  according to the best of my
understanding  and as the election of the new minister plenipotentiary
was on the fourteenth of september  and the alliance sailed from
boston the fourteenth of january  and in this space of four months no
notice appears to have been taken of me  i think the only inference
that can be made is  that congress have no further service for me on
this side the water  and that all my duties are on the other  i have
accordingly given notice to his excellency     de sartine  and to his
excellency the minister plenipotentiary here  of my intentions to
return  which i shall do by the first frigate that sails for any part
of the united states  unless i should receive counter orders in the
meantime  in a matter of so much uncertainty  i hope i shall not incur
the disapprobation of congress  even if i should not judge aright of
their intentions  which it is my desire as well as my duty to observe 
as far as i can know them 

by the papers enclosed with this  congress will perceive the
discontented and tumultuous state of the three kingdoms of england 
scotland  and ireland  which is so great and so rapidly increasing 
that the united states will have little to fear from reinforcements of
their enemies the ensuing campaign  all their forces will be necessary
to keep in order their own riotous populace  and to replace those
which are daily consuming in the west indies  there is  however  no
prospect of their evacuating either new york or rhode island  the
possession of those places is so indispensable for the preservation of
their west india and other trade  as well as of their other dominions
in america  that nothing but the last necessity will induce them to
give them up 

the greatest source of danger and unhappiness to the states then
probably will be a depreciating currency  the prospect of a loan in
europe  after every measure that has been or could be taken  i think
it my duty to say frankly to congress  is very unpromising  the causes
of this are very obvious  and cannot be removed  the state of our
country itself  and the course of exchange  would be sufficient to
discourage such a loan  if there were no other obstruction  but there
are many others  there are more borrowers in europe than lenders  and
the british loan itself will not be made this year at a less interest
than seven and a half per cent 

i see no hope of relief  but from economy and taxation  and those i
flatter myself will be found sufficient  if the people are once
convinced of the necessity of them  when a people are contending not
only for the greatest object  that any people ever had in view  but
for security from the greatest evil that any nation ever had to dread 
 for there is at this hour no medium between unlimited subjugation to
parliament and entire sovereignty  they must be destitute of sense as
well as of virtue  if they are not willing to pay sufficient sums
annually to defray the necessary expense of their defence in future 
supported as they are by so powerful an ally  and by the prospect of
others  against a kingdom already exhausted  without any ally at all 
or a possibility of obtaining one  as this is the first time i have
had the honor to address myself to congress  since we received the
news of your excellency   appointment to the chair  you will please
to accept of my congratulations on that event 

  i have the honor to be  with the highest esteem

  sir 

my last letter to congress was on the twentyseventh of last month 
since which an account of the new loan is received from london  and as
this may  perhaps  afford to congress the clearest proof of the
weakness of their enemies  it is of importance  that it should be
transmitted to them  some accounts say  that the loan is to be seven
millions  others eight  the conditions of the loan are  in general 
the established interest of three per cent  an annuity for three and
three quarters per cent for twentynine years  and seven lottery
tickets for every thousand pounds 

in one account the advantages are thus stated 

  100 3 per cent                                       £61 00 00
  £3 15   annuity for twentynine years  at
    twelve years  purchase                              45 00 00
  two fifths of a year   interest and annuity  gained
    by both beginning from the 5th of january 
    although the money is paid monthly  and
    not ended until december                             2 14 00
  £3 premium of seven lottery tickets for each
    £1000  gives for each hundred                        2  2 00
                                                                
  for each £100 paid  there is received               £110 16 00

this statement for the first year is pretty accurate  another account
makes it ten and one quarter per cent for the first year  the
subsequent years  however it will not be so much  yet for all the
subsequent years  during the term of the annuity  it will be six and
three quarters per cent  upon the whole  it is generally looked upon
as good as seven and a half per cent  in a country where the highest
interest  that is tolerated by the standing laws  is five per cent 
this is a terrible symptom 

while this system has any credit among the money lenders in holland 
switzerland  geneva      congress will perceive  that there is little
hope of procuring a private loan for the united states from any of
those places  whether any may be procured from any state  or prince 
time must discover 

  i have the honor to be

  dear sir 

i beg leave to apply to you  in an instance where i am much concerned 
the case i shall lay before you  and recommend to your care  there is
an officer in paris  whom i wish to send over to america on board the
alliance  and who i know would be of service in the american army  for
that reason  besides his recommendations  i have a great regard for
him  i wish the gentleman may find a passage in the frigate  dr
franklin cannot officially send an officer  but i beg you would take
him along with you  as i take upon myself the charge of presenting him
to congress  all the marks of kindness i ever met with from them  and
the knowledge which the strictest friendship has given me of general
washington   sentiments  make me as certain as possible  that my
officer will meet with the best reception in philadelphia and in the
army  who know i am acquainted with what may be convenient to them 

it is with a great concern  that i hear of discontents between captain
landais and his officers  and i flatter myself  that you will again
establish harmony and concord among them  i will take the opportunity
of this frigate to write over to my friends in america 

the articles alluded to in your letter from passy  i have been very
busy about  but i did not meet with great success till now  and what
is done is not equal to what i could wish  it is true  our
circumstances are rather narrow at this moment  and i believe  that
the ministers are willing to do what they think possible  or
advantageous  but we do not always agree in opinion  i hope  however 
america will have more and more occasions of knowing the true
attachment of this nation for her 

with great impatience i wait for your answer  that i may send the
officer to nantes  i hope you will not refuse your patronage on this
occasion  and i may answer congress will have no objection to take a
gentleman whom i send them  you will  my dear sir  in settling his
passage  much oblige your humble servant

  dear sir 

your favors of june the 2  and 5th are now before me  that of the 29th
of march i have answered  if i ever received it  for i have answered
every one i have received from you  but not having my papers at hand
cannot be particular  i thank you for the manuscript and the pamphlet 

i am happy to hear from you  and from all others  so agreeable a
character of the chevalier de la luzerne  and    marbois  the last of
whom i have had the pleasure to see 

i wish it was in my power to do more for mr ford  and to take him with
me  but the frigate will be so crowded  i fear it will be impossible 

the declarations of the northern powers against the right of england
to stop their merchant vessels  and arming to support their rights 
are important events  the displacing of mr paine is a disagreeable and
alarming one 

it is with no small astonishment  that i learn by your letter of the
5th  that by advices from america since your last to me  your enemies
are determined to impeach your attachment to our country and her
cause  your request that i would give my opinion on that subject  from
the knowledge i have had of your conduct  while we acted in commission
together  can meet with no objection from me  but i hope i need not
inform you  that my opinion upon this point is no secret at
versailles  paris  nantes  or elsewhere  enclosed is a copy of a
letter i did myself the honor to write to his excellency the count de
vergennes some time ago  which  for anything i know  is communicated
to all the court  but the answer shows that it was received  i had my
reasons then for keeping it to myself  which exist now no more  i
would transcribe the whole correspondence if it was in my power  but i
have not time  and it is sufficient to say  that it was conducted by
his excellency with the most obliging politeness  it is my duty now to
furnish you with a copy  lest any accident may befal me  which is by
no means improbable  i thought then  and am confirmed in that opinion
more and more  that it was my duty to communicate my sentiments at
court  upon that very extraordinary occasion  and from regard to my
own reputation  i am very glad you have given me an opportunity of
furnishing you with evidence  that i did this part of my duty so far
forth  the letter was written  sent to versailles  and received by his
excellency before the arrival of the marquis de lafayette  his
aid de camp  or dr winship  that is  before the news reached passy of
the new arrangement  45  but lest that letter should not be
sufficient  i shall enclose another certificate  not without a
heartfelt grief  that malice should have been so daring and so
barbarous  as to make either such a letter or such a certificate from
me either necessary or even pardonable  46  your hint  that i must
correct some things that are amiss  extorts from me an involuntary
sigh  i shall be in a situation critical and difficult without
example  my own character at stake from various quarters  and without
anything to support me but truth and innocence  and you need not be
informed  that these are not always sufficient  i have little
expectation of doing good  god grant i may do no harm  i shall not
designedly  but i suppose congress intend to examine me as a witness 
and i must tell the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth 
as far as i know it  if the task should end here  i should not be much
embarrassed  but if they should proceed to demand of me opinions and
judgments of men and things  as there is reason to expect they will 
although i hope they will not  what will be the consequences  upon the
whole  truth must be my shield  and if the shafts of interested malice
can pierce through this  they shall pierce me 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams

  sir 

on the 27th of february  i had the honor of writing to congress 
informing them of my intention of returning home  in consequence of
the commission which superseded mine  on the first of march  i had
again the honor of writing some information concerning the
unprecedented interest  which the british government are obliged to
give for the loan of money for the service of the present year  on the
8th of march  i took my leave of the american minister  and left paris
for nantes  in expectation of there meeting the alliance  and sailing
in her for america in a few weeks  upon my arrival at nantes  i
learned the alliance was yet at brest  and so embarrassed with nearly
forty prisoners  who were supposed to have been concerned in a
conspiracy to carry her to england  and with other difficulties  that
it was uncertain when she would be ready 

the agent at nantes at this time receiving a letter from his
excellency  dr franklin  desiring him to consult me about the
direction of the alliance  i thought it would expedite the public
service for me to make a journey to brest  about two hundred miles 
which i undertook accordingly  and arrived at that port without loss
of time  there  after an attendance of some weeks  and much
negotiation with the commandant  intendant  and agent  all things were
prepared for the frigate to sail for nantes  with about one hundred
british prisoners  to be exchanged for a like number of american
prisoners  arrived there from england in a cartel  i returned to
nantes  and the alliance in a few days arrived in the river  the
prisoners were exchanged  about sixty enlisted in the alliance  and
the rest in the poor richard  captain jones 

after accommodating all the difficulties with the british prisoners 
the american prisoners  the officers and crew of the alliance  and
supplying all their necessary wants  captain landais  having orders to
sail for america  and everything ready to proceed to sea in a few
days  received unexpected orders to proceed to   orient  and wait
there for further orders  i had the honor of a letter at the same time
from his excellency  enclosing one from the minister of marine  by
which i learned  that the king had been graciously pleased to grant me
a passage on board the frigate  which was to carry his majesty   new
minister plenipotentiary to the united states  that the frigate was at
  orient  and that the minister would be there in a few days  i went
in the alliance from nantes to   orient  where after some time the
frigate  the sensible  arrived  but his excellency  the chevalier de
la luzerne  did not arrive until the 10th of june  on the 14th of
june  and not before  i had the pleasure to be under sail  and on the
3  of august  arrived in nantasket roads 

i have entered into this detail of disappointments to justify myself
for not returning sooner  and to shew that it was not my fault  that i
was not at home in eight weeks from the first authentic information 
that i had nothing further to do in france  there is nothing remaining
for me to do but to settle my accounts with congress  but as part of
my accounts are in conjunction with my late colleagues  with whom i
lived in the same house during my residence in paris  i am not able to
judge whether congress will choose to receive my accounts  or to wait
until the other commissioners shall exhibit theirs  and have the whole
together  under one view  so as to do equal justice to all  i am
ready  however  to render all the account in my power  either jointly
or separately  whenever congress shall order it  and i shall wait
their directions accordingly 

it is not in my power  having been so long from paris  to give
congress any news of importance  except that the brest fleet  under
the count   orvilliers  was at sea the beginning of june  that admiral
arbuthnot was at plymouth the 31st of may  and that there was a
universal persuasion  arising from letters from paris and london  that
spain had decided against the english  the chevalier de la luzerne
will be able to give congress satisfactory information upon this head 

i ought not to conclude this letter  without expressing my obligations
to captain chavagne  and the other officers of the sensible  for their
civilities in the course of my passage home  and the pleasure i have
had in the conversation of his excellency  the new minister
plenipotentiary from our august ally  and the secretary to the
embassy  monsieur marbois 

the chevalier de la luzerne is a knight of the order of st john of
jerusalem  of an ancient and noble family  connected by blood with
many characters of principal name in the kingdom  a grandson of the
celebrated chancellor de la moignon  a nephew of monsieur malesherbes 
perhaps still more famous as first president of the court of aids and
as a minister of state  a brother to the count de la luzerne  and of
the bishop of sangres  one of the three dukes and peers who had the
honor to assist in the consecration of the king  a near relation of
the marcéhal de broglie and the count his brother  and of many other
important personages in that country  nor is his personal character
less respectable than his connexions  as he is possessed of much
useful information of all kinds  and particularly of the political
system of europe  obtained in his late embassy in bavaria  and of the
justest sentiments of the mutual interests of his country and ours 
and of the utility to both of that alliance  which so happily unites
them  and at the same time divested of all personal and party
attachments and aversions  congress and their constituents  i flatter
myself  will have much satisfaction in his negotiations  as well as in
those of the secretary to the embassy  who was recently secretary to
the embassy in bavaria  and who is a counsellor of the parliament of
metz  a gentleman whose abilities  application  and disposition cannot
fail to make him useful in the momentous office he sustains 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect

  sir 

at the close of the service on which congress have done me the honor
to send me  it may not be amiss to submit a few remarks to their
consideration on the general state of affairs in europe  as far as
they relate to the interests of the united states  as the time
approaches  when our relations with the most considerable states in
europe will multiply and assume a greater stability  they deserve the
attention of americans in general  but especially of those composing
their supreme council 

france deserves the first place among those powers  with which our
connexions will be the most intimate  and it is with pleasure i am
able to assure congress  that from the observations i have made during
my residence in that kingdom  i have the strongest reasons to believe 
that their august ally  his ministers  and nation  are possessed of
the fullest persuasion of the justice of our cause  of the great
importance of our independence to their interests  and the firmest
resolution to preserve the faith of treaties inviolate  and to
cultivate our friendship with sincerity and zeal  this is of the more
consequence to us  as this power enjoys in europe at this hour an
influence  which it has not before experienced for many years 

men are so sensible of a constant tendency in others to excesses  that
a signal superiority of power never appears  without exciting
jealousies and efforts to reduce it  thus  when spain  under charles
the fifth and his successor  made herself dangerous  a great part of
europe united against her  assisted in severing the united provinces
from her  and by degrees greatly diminished her power  thus  when
france  under lewis the fourteenth  indulged the spirit of conquest
too far  a great part of mankind united their forces against her  with
such success as to involve her in a train of misfortunes  out of which
she never emerged before the present reign  the english  in their
turn  by means of their commerce and extensive settlements abroad 
arose to a degree of opulence and naval power  which excited more
extravagant passions in her own breast  and more tyrannical exertions
of her influence  than appeared in either of the other cases  the
consequence has been similar  but more remarkable  europe seems to be
more universally and sincerely united in the desire of reducing her 
than they ever were in any former instance  this is the true cause why
the french court never made war with so universal a popularity among
their own subjects  so general an approbation of other courts  and
such unanimous wishes among all nations for her success  as at this
time 

the personal character of the king  his declared patronage of morals
and economy  and the great strokes of wisdom  which have marked the
commencement of his reign  the active spring which has been given to
commerce by the division of the british empire  and our new connexions
with his subjects  all these causes  together with the two treaties of
peace  which have been lately signed under his auspices and his
mediation  have given to this power a reputation  which the last reign
had lost 

the first of these treaties has determined those controversies  which
had for a long time divided russia and the porte  and the parties have
been equally satisfied with the conditions of their reconciliation  a
circumstance the more honorable for the french ministry  and the
chevalier de st priest  their ambassador at constantinople  as it is
uncommon  the ancient confidence of the porte in the court of
versailles has revived  and the coolness  or rather enmity  which
divided france and russia for near twenty years  gives place to a
friendship  which is at this time in all its fervor  and will probably
be durable  as these powers have no interest to annoy each other  but 
on the contrary  are able to assist each other in a manner the most
essential 

the peace of germany  signed at teschin  the 13th of last may  has not
equally satisfied the belligerent powers  who were on the one part the
emperor  and on the other  the king of prussia and the elector of
saxony his ally 

from the multitudes of writings  which have appeared before and during
this war  in which the causes  the motives  and the rights of it are
discussed  it appears  that in 1768  at the extinction of one of the
branches of the house of bavaria  which has been separated from its
trunk for near five centuries  the house of austria thought itself
able  and priests and lawyers among their own subjects were
complaisant enough to tell her  that she had a right to put herself in
possession of the best part of the patrimony of the extinguished line 

the king of prussia  to whose interest this augmentation of power
would have been dangerous  has crowned an illustrious reign  by
displaying all the resources of military genius and profound policy in
opposition to it  while he contended in the field  france negotiated 
and the work  begun by his arms  was completed by the cabinet of
versailles 

the palatine house of bavaria  the duke of deux ponts  and
particularly the elector of saxony  have obtained all they could
reasonably demand  and the empire has preserved its balance of power
in spite of its head  the king of prussia had covered himself with
glory  to which he put the finishing stroke  by not demanding any
compensation for the expenses of the war  all parties have been
satisfied except the emperor  who has disordered his finances  ruined
his kingdom of bohemia with immense fines  has not obtained any
advantage over his adversary  and consequently has destroyed among his
own troops the opinion they had of their superiority  and  in fine 
has sustained a loss the most sensible for a young prince just
beginning to reign  the reputation of justice and moderation  it is
the influence  the address  and ability of the french minister  joined
to the firmness of russia  which have completed this work  and lewis
the sixteenth has restored in germany to the nation over which he
reigns  that reputation which his grandfather had lost 

the merit of the chevalier de la luzerne  who was ambassador in
bavaria during the transaction of this business  and that of   
marbois  the secretary to that embassy  in accomplishing an affair of
such importance  which was rendered peculiarly delicate by the late
family connexion between the courts of vienna and versailles  was
probably a motive for sending them now to america  a mission of no
less importance and no less delicacy 

it is not probable  however  that they could have succeeded so soon 
if england could have afforded subsidies to the emperor  the
revolution in america  in which the french king has taken an earlier
and a greater part than any other sovereign in europe  has operated so
as to conciliate to him a consideration that is universal  the new
minister will give to congress information the most precise in this
respect  and touching the part which spain is taking at this time  for
which reason i shall refrain from entering into it  and content myself
with observing  that all these considerations ought to induce us to
cherish the alliance of france  and that every good citizen of the
united states ought to endeavor to destroy the remains of those
prejudices  which our ancient rulers have endeavored to inspire us
with  that we have nothing to fear and much to hope from france  while
we conduct ourselves with good sense and firmness  and that we cannot
take too much pains to multiply the commercial relations  and
strengthen the political connexions between the two nations  provided
always  that we preserve prudence and resolution enough to receive
implicitly no advice whatever  but to judge always for ourselves  and
to guard ourselves against those principles in government  and those
manners  which are so opposite to our own constitution and to our own
characters  as a young people  called by providence to the most
honorable and important of all duties  that of forming establishments
for a great nation and a new world 

in the opinion of some  the power with which we shall one day have a
relation the most immediate  next to that of france  is great britain 
but it ought to be considered  that this power loses every day her
consideration  and runs towards her ruin  her riches  in which her
power consisted  she has lost with us  and never can regain  with us
she has lost her mediterranean trade  her african trade  her german
and holland trade  her ally  portugal  her ally  russia  and her
natural ally  the house of austria  at least  as being unable to
protect these as she once did  she can obtain no succor from them  in
short  one branch of commerce has been lopped off after another  and
one political interest sacrificed after another  she resembles the
melancholy spectacle of a great wide spreading tree  that has been
girded at the root  her endeavors to regain these advantages  will
continually keep alive in her breast the most malevolent passions
towards us  her envy  her jealousy  and resentment  will never leave
us  while we are what we must unavoidably be  her rivals in the
fisheries  in various other branches of commerce  and even in naval
power  if peace should unhappily be made  leaving canada  nova scotia 
or the floridas  or any of them  in her hands  jealousies and
controversies will be perpetually arising  the degree  therefore  of
intercourse with this nation  which will ever again take place  may
justly be considered as problematical  or rather the probability is 
that it will never be so great as some persons imagine  moreover  i
think that every citizen in the present circumstances  who respects
his country  and the engagements she has taken  ought to abstain from
the foresight of a return of friendship between us and the english 
and act as if it never was to be 

but it is lawful to consider  that which will probably be formed
between the hollanders and us  the similitude of manners  of religion 
and in some respects of constitution  the analogy between the means by
which the two republics arrived at independency  but above all the
attractions of commercial interest  will infallibly draw them
together  this connexion will not probably show itself  before a peace
or a near prospect of peace  too many motives of fear or interest
place the hollanders in a dependance on england  to suffer her to
connect herself openly with us at present  nevertheless  if the king
of prussia  could be induced to take us by the hand  his great
influence in the united provinces might contribute greatly to
conciliate their friendship for us  loans of money  and the operations
of commercial agents or societies  will be the first threads of our
connexions with this power  from the essays and inquiries of your
commissioners at paris  it appears  that some money may be borrowed
there  and from the success of several enterprises by the way of st
eustatia  it seems that the trade between the two countries is likely
to increase  and possibly congress may think it expedient to send a
minister there  if they should  it will be proper to give him a
discretionary power to produce his commission or not  as he shall find
it likely to succeed  to give him full powers and clear instructions
concerning the borrowing of money  and the man himself above all
should have consummate prudence  and a caution and discretion  that
will be proof against every trial 

if congress could find any means of paying the interest annually in
europe  commercial and pecuniary connexions would strengthen
themselves from day to day  and if the fall of the credit of england
should terminate in bankruptcy  the seven united provinces  having
nothing to dissemble  would be zealous for a part of those rich
benefits  which our commerce offers to the maritime powers  and by an
early treaty with us secure those advantages  from which they have
already discovered strong symptoms of a fear of being excluded by
delays  it is scarcely necessary to observe to congress  that holland
has lost her influence in europe to such a degree  that there is
little other regard for her remaining but that of a prodigal heir for
a rich usurer  who lends him money at a high interest  the state
which is poor and in debt has no political stability  their army is
very small  and their navy is less  the immense riches of individuals
may possibly be in some future time the great misfortune of the
nation  because the means of defence are not proportioned to the
temptation which is held out for some necessitous  avaricious  and
formidable neighbor to invade her 

the active commerce of spain is very inconsiderable  of her passive
commerce  we shall not fail to have a part  the vicinity of this
power  her forces  her resources  ought to make us attentive to her
conduct  but if we may judge of the future by the past  i should hope
we had nothing to fear from it  the genius and interest of the nation
incline it to repose  she cannot determine upon war but in the last
extremity  and even then she sighs for peace  she is not possessed of
the spirit of conquest  and we have reason to congratulate ourselves 
that we have her for the nearest and principal neighbor  her conduct
towards us at this time will perhaps appear equivocal and indecisive 
her determinations appear to be solely the fruit of the negotiations
of the court of versailles  but it ought to be considered  she has not
had motives so pressing as those of france to take in hand our
defence  whether she has an eye upon the floridas  or what other terms
she may expect from congress  they are no doubt better informed than i
am  to their wisdom it must be submitted to give her satisfaction  if
her terms are moderate  and her offers in proportion  this conduct may
conciliate her affection and shorten delays  a point of great
importance  as the present moment appears to be decisive 

portugal  under the administration of the marquis de pombal  broke
some of the shackles by which she was held to england  but the
treaty  by which a permanent friendship is established between the
crowns of spain and portugal  was made in 1777  an event that the
english deplore as the greatest evil  next to the irrecoverable loss
of the colonies  arising from this war  because they will now no
longer be able to play off portugal against spain  in order to draw
away her attention as well as her forces  as in former times  but as
portugal has not known how to deliver herself entirely from the
influence of england  we shall have little to hope from her  on the
other hand  such is her internal weakness  that we have absolutely
nothing to fear  we shall necessarily have commerce with her  but
whether she will ever have the courage to sacrifice the friendship of
england for the sake of it is uncertain 

it would be useless to consider that infinite number of little
sovereignties into which germany is divided  and develope all their
political interests  this task is as much beyond my knowledge as it
would be useless to congress  they will have few relations friendly or
hostile with this country  excepting in two branches of commerce  that
of merchandise and that of soldiers  the latter  infamous and
detestable as it is  has been established between a nation  once
generous  humane  and brave  and certain princes  as avaricious of
money as they are prodigal of the blood of their subjects  and such is
the scarcity of cash  and the avidity for it in germany  and so little
are the rights of humanity understood and respected  that sellers will
probably be found as long as buyers  america will never be found in
either class  the state of germany  with which we may have commerce of
an honorable kind  is the house of austria  one of the most powerful
in europe  she possesses very few countries  however  near the sea 
ostend is the principal city  where she might have established a trade
of some consequence  if the jealousy of the maritime powers had not
constantly opposed it  france  spain  holland  and england  have been
all agreed in their opposition  and the treaty of utrecht  ratified
more than once by subsequent treaties  has so shackled this port  that
it will be impossible to open a direct trade to it  without some new
treaty  which possibly may not be very distant  england may possibly
make a new treaty with austria  and agree to privileges for this port 
in order to draw away the advantages of the american trade from france
and spain  and in such a treaty holland may possibly acquiesce  if not
accede to it  the port of trieste enjoys liberty without limits  and
the court of vienna is anxious to make its commerce flourish  situated
as it is at the bottom of the gulf of trieste  the remotest part of
the gulf of venice  tedious and difficult as the navigation of those
seas is  we could make little use of it at any time  and none at all
while this war continues 

this court would seize with eagerness the advantages  that are
presented to her by the independence of america  but an interest more
powerful restrains her  and although she is certainly attentive to
this revolution  there is reason to believe she will be one of the
last powers to acknowledge our independence  she is so far from being
rich  that she is destitute of the means of making war without
subsidies  as is proved by the peace which has lately been made  she
has occasion for the succors of france or of england to put in motion
her numerous armies  she conceives easily  that the loss of the
resources and credit of the english has disabled them to pay the
enormous subsidies  which  in former times  they have poured into the
austrian coffers  she sees therefore with a secret mortification  that
she shall be hereafter more at the mercy of france  who may choose her
ally  and prefer at her pleasure either austria or prussia  while
neither vienna nor berlin will be able  as in times past  to choose
between paris and london  since the latter has lost her past opulence
and pecuniary resources  it is our duty to remark these great changes
in the system of mankind  which have already happened in consequence
of the american war  the alienation of portugal from england  the
peace of germany  and that between petersburg and constantinople  by
all which events england has lost  and france gained  such a
superiority of influence and power  are owing entirely to the blind
division of that policy and wealth  which the english might have still
enjoyed  from the objects of their true interests and honor  to the
ruinous american war 

the court of berlin flatters itself  that the connexions which have
heretofore so long united france and prussia will renew themselves
sooner or later  this system is more rational than that which subsists
at this day  the king of prussia may then wait without anxiety the
consequences of the present revolution  because it tends to increase
the resources of his natural ally  the jealousy between the emperor
and the king of prussia  and that between the houses of bourbon and
austria  are a natural tie between france and prussia  the rivalry
between france and great britain is another motive  too natural and
too permanent for the former to suffer the king of prussia to be long
the ally of the latter  one of the favorite projects of prussia  that
of rendering the port of emden a place of flourishing trade  interests
him most powerfully in our independence  silesia  one of his best
provinces  has already felt the influence of it  and  sensible of the
force that empires derive from commerce  he is earnestly desirous to
see it introduced between america and his states  which gives ground
to believe  that as austria will be one of the last so prussia will be
one of the first to acknowledge our independence  an opinion which is
rendered more probable by the answer  which was given by the baron de
schulenburg to mr arthur lee  and the influence of the king of prussia
in the united provinces  which is greater than that of any other
power  arising from his great military force  and the vicinity of his
dominions  his near relation to the stadtholder and the prince of
brunswick  is an additional motive to cultivate his friendship  the
electorate of saxony  with a fruitful soil  contains a numerous and
industrious people  and most of the commerce between the east and the
west of europe passes through it  the fairs of leipsic have drawn
considerable advantages for these four years from our trade  this
power will see with pleasure the moment  which shall put the last hand
to our independence  the rest of germany  excepting hamburgh and
bremen  have no means of opening a direct commerce with us  with the
latter we have no connexion at present  in the former all the commerce
of lower germany is transacted  here we shall soon have occasion to
establish an agent or consul 

poland  depopulated by the war and a vicious government  reduced by a
shameful treaty to two thirds of her ancient dominion  destitute of
industry and manufactures  even of the first necessity  has no
occasion for the productions of america  dantzic sees her ancient
prosperity diminish every day  there is  therefore  little probability
of commerce  and less of any political connexion between that nation
and us 

russia  sweden  and denmark  comprehended under the denomination of
the northern powers  have been thought by some to be interested in our
return to the domination of great britain  whether they consider
themselves in this light or not  their late declarations against the
right of england to interrupt their navigation  and their arming for
the protection of their commerce on the ocean  and even in the english
channel  are unequivocal proofs of their opinion concerning the right
in our contest  and of their intentions not to interfere against us 
it is very true  that the articles of commerce which they produce  are
in many respects the same with those of america  yet if we consider
that we shall have occasion to purchase from them large quantities of
hemp and sailcloth  and that our productions of timber  pitch  tar 
and turpentine  are less profitable with us without bounties  than
some other branches of labor  it is not probable that we shall lower
the price of these articles in europe so much as some conjecture  and
consequently our increased demand upon those countries for several
articles will be more than a compensation to them for the small loss
they may sustain  by a trifling reduction in the price of those
articles  it is not probable that the courts of petersburg  stockholm 
and copenhagen have viewed with indifference the present revolution 
if they have been apprehensive of being hurt by it in some respects 
which however i think must have been a mistaken apprehension  yet the
motive of humbling the pride of the english  who have endeavored to
exercise their domination  even over the northern seas  and to render
the danish and swedish flag dependent on theirs  has prevailed over
all others  and they are considered in europe as having given their
testimony against the english in this war 

italy  a country which declines every day from its ancient prosperity 
offers few objects to our speculations  the privileges of the port of
leghorn  nevertheless  may render it useful to our ships  when our
independence shall be acknowledged by great britain  if  as we once
flattered ourselves  the court of vienna might receive an american
minister  we were equally in error respecting the court of the grand
duchy of tuscany  where an austrian prince reigns  who receives all
his directions from vienna  in such a manner that he will probably
never receive any person in a public character  until the chief of his
house has set him the example  the king of the two sicilies is in the
same dependence on the court of madrid  and we may depend upon it  he
will conform himself to all it shall suggest to him  this prince has
already ordered the ports of his dominions to be open to american
vessels  public and private  and has ordered his ambassador at paris
to apply to your commissioners for a description of the american flag 
that our vessels might be known  and receive no molestation upon their
appearance in his harbors 

the court of rome  attached to ancient customs  would be one of the
last to acknowledge our independence  if we were to solicit for it 
but congress will probably never send a minister to his holiness  who
can do them no service  upon condition of receiving a catholic legate
or nuncio in return  or in other words  an ecclesiastical tyrant 
which it is to be hoped the united states will be too wise ever to
admit into their territories 

the states of the king of sardinia are poor  and their commerce is
very small  the little port of villa franca will probably see few
american vessels  nor will there be any close relations  either
commercial or political  between this prince and us 

the republic of genoa is scarcely known at this day in europe  but by
those powers who borrow money  it is possible that some small sums
might be obtained there  if congress would fall upon means of insuring
a punctual payment of interest in europe 

venice  heretofore so powerful  is reduced to a very inconsiderable
commerce  and is in an entire state of decay 

switzerland is another lender of money  but neither her position nor
her commerce can occasion any near relation with us 

whether there is anything in these remarks worth the trouble of
reading  i shall submit to the wisdom of congress  and subscribe
myself  with the highest consideration  your most obedient and humble
servant

  my dear sir 

since i have had opportunity to converse a little in this country  and
to read a few gazettes  i find that questions have been agitated here
in the newspapers  and in private circles  as well as in congress 
concerning his excellency  the count de vergennes  and mr arthur lee 
which seem to make it necessary that i should send the enclosed
copies  47  you can judge better than i whether it will be of any
public utility to lay them before congress  my first letter  and his
excellency   answer  i can see no objection to laying before
congress  but as the rest 48  contain little else besides mutual
compliments  perhaps it will be as well to conceal them  i submit the
whole  however  to your discretion  and am  with much esteem     

                                                           john adams

  sir 

looking over the printed journals of the 15th of last april  i find in
the report of the committee appointed to take into consideration the
foreign affairs of the united states  and also the conduct of the late
and present commissioners of these states  the two following articles 

1   that it appears to them  that dr franklin is plenipotentiary for
these states at the court of france  dr arthur lee  commissioner for
the court of spain  mr william lee  commissioner for the courts of
vienna and berlin  mr ralph izard  commissioner for the court of
tuscany  that mr john adams was appointed one of the commissioners at
the court of france  in the place of mr deane  who had been appointed
a joint commissioner with dr franklin and dr arthur lee  but that the
said commission of mr adams is superseded by the plenipotentiary
commission to dr franklin 

2   that in the course of their examination and inquiry  they find
many complaints against the said commissioners  and the political and
commercial agency of mr deane  which complaints  with the evidence in
support thereof  are herewith delivered  and to which the committee
beg leave to refer  

the word  said  in the second article  refers to the commissioners
mentioned in the first  and as my name is among them  i learn from
hence  that there were some complaints against me  and that the
evidence in support of them was delivered to congress by the
committee 

i therefore pray  that i may be favored with copies of those
complaints  evidences  and the names of my accusers  and the witnesses
against me  that i may take such measures as may be in my power to
justify myself to congress 

i have the honor to be

  sir 

i had yesterday the honor of your letter of the 7th of this month  i
thank you  sir  for your obliging congratulations on my return to my
family and country 

the reason why my letters of the 27th of february  and the 1st of
march  arrived so late was  that they were delivered at the time of
their dates to gentlemen then bound to the seaports  who expected to
sail directly for america  but were disappointed of passages  until
the vessels sailed under the convoy of the sensible 

i have not my letter book here  but i do not remember that they
contained anything of much consequence  so that i suppose the
inconvenience of their late arrival was not much 

you will be pleased to make my most respectful compliments to the
members of congress  and believe me  with great esteem     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                           to james lovell 

                                        braintree  october 17th  1779 

  my dear sir 

what shall i say to your favors of the 27th and 28th of september 
which came by the last post  the unanimity of my election surprises
me  as much as the delicacy  importance  and danger of the trust
distress me  the appointment of mr dana to be secretary pleases me
more than my own to be minister  commissioner  negotiator  call it
what you will  i have communicated to him your letters in confidence 
and all other material intelligence i had  and hope he will not
decline  but you know the peculiarities of his situation  and if he
should refuse  i hope you will not force your name out of nomination
again  i did not suppose that such characters would be willing to go
as secretaries  because i did not know your plan  otherwise i should
not have mentioned mr jennings to mr gerry for one to dr franklin 
your mastery of the language  and your indefatigability  would make
you infinitely useful in any of these departments 

i rejoice that you produced my letter to the count de vergennes and
his answer before the choice  because it contained a testimony in
favor of mr lee  which was his due  49  i am very much affected at his
recall  because i know his merit  and  therefore  i am glad i was not
placed in his stead  for suspicions would have arisen  and
reflections would have been cast upon me  as having favored his
removal in order to make room  which i certainly did not  i am
infinitely obliged to you for those letters  and for that received the
post before last  but i really tremble for your health  let me entreat
you  for the sake of our country  to take care of it  if i was to
apply myself as you do  i should soon go to study politics in another
sphere  yet i am so selfish as to beg the continuance of your favors
to me  and i pledge myself to you  i will not be in debt any more than
may be made by the intrinsic difference in the value of the letters 
which will be unavoidable 

i thank you for the extract from mr izard   letter  i am not a little
surprised at its contents  it was written  i see  to his friend  and i
suppose intended in confidence  i am fully persuaded he did not
intend  that the whole should have been laid before congress  50  i
utterly deny that i ever used to him any such language  as the
indecent paragraph that closes what he says about me  indeed  that is
manifestly his own inference  and in his own words  from what he says
he had heard me say  and he draws the same from what dr franklin and
mr deane had said upon the same subject  i further deny that i ever
 threatened  him with the displeasure of congress  for writing his
opinion concerning these articles to congress  or for suggesting them
to the commissioners  but to enter into all the conversations that
have passed between mr izard and me respecting those articles  and
many other points in order to give a full and fair representation of
those conversations  would fill a small volume  yet there never was
any angry or rude conversation between him and me  that i can
recollect  i lived with him on good terms  visited him and he me 
dined with his family  and his family with me  and i ever told him 
and repeated it often  that i should be always obliged to him for his
advice  opinions  and sentiments upon any american subject  and that i
should always give it its due weight  although i did not think myself
bound to follow it any further than it seemed to me to be just  as
congress have declined giving me the charges against me by their
authority  and have  upon the whole  acquitted me with so much
splendor  it would look like a littleness of soul in me to make myself
anxious  or give them any further trouble about it  and as i have in
general so good an opinion of mr izard   attachment to his country 
and of his honor  i shall not think myself bound to take any further
notice of this fruit of his inexperience in public life  this peevish
ebullition of the rashness of his temper  i have written a few other
observations to mr gerry on the same subject  you and he will compare
these with them for your private satisfaction  but be sure that they
are not exposed where they will do harm to the public  to mr izard  or
me  unnecessarily 

if i should go abroad  cannot you lend me twenty or thirty complete
sets of the journals  they are much wanted in europe  a set of them is
a genteel present  and perhaps would do me and the public more service
than you are aware of  if congress  or some committee would order it 
i should be very glad 

  i am

  sir 

i had in paris an opportunity of procuring information concerning the
british whale fishery on the coast of brazil  which it is proper to
communicate to congress  that if any advantage can be made of it the
opportunity may not be lost 

the last year and the year before the english carried on this fishery
to very great advantage  off the river plate in south america  in the
latitude of 35° south  and from thence to 40°  just on the edge of
soundings  off and on  as the sailors express it  and about longitude
65° from london  they had about seventeen vessels in this fishery 
which all sailed from london in the months of september and october 
all the officers and men americans from nantucket and cape cod  two or
three from rhode island  and one from long island  four or five of
these vessels went to greenland  to which place they sail yearly  the
last of february or the beginning of march 

the year before last  there was published in the english newspapers  a
letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de bredt  in coleman
street  informing him  that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil
fleet  but this i had certain information was a forgery  calculated
merely to deceive american privateers  and no convoy actually went or
was appointed  either last year or the year before  although the
imposture was repeated both times  and will no doubt be renewed this 

for the capture or destruction of a fishery so wholly defenceless  not
one of the vessels having any arms  a single frigate  or indeed a
privateer of four and twenty guns  would be sufficient  the beginning
of december would be the best time to proceed from boston or
philadelphia  because the frigate would then find the whaling vessels
nearly loaded  the cargoes of bone and oil are very valuable  and at
least four hundred and fifty of the best kind of seamen would be taken
out of the hands of the english  and might be gained into the american
service  most of the officers and men wish well to this country  and
would gladly be in its service  if they could be delivered from that
they are engaged in  whenever the english men of war or privateers 
have taken an american vessel  they have given to all the whalemen
found among the crew  by order of government  their choice  either to
go on board a man of war and fight against their country  or into the
whale fishery  such numbers have chosen the latter  as have made up
the crews of seventeen vessels 

i thought it my duty to communicate this  that if so profitable a
branch of commerce  and so valuable a nursery of seamen  can be taken
from the english  it may be done  i prevailed with my colleagues last
year to represent these facts to his excellency     de sartine  but it
appears that his majesty   service would not admit of any enterprise
from france in consequence of it  since my return i have represented
them to the council of this state  but whether anything can be done by
them  after the disaster at penobscot  i doubt  if congress should not
deem it consistent with the public service to send a frigate upon this
service  nothing will be lost but the trouble of this letter 

i have the honor to congratulate your excellency on your advancement
to the chair  and to subscribe myself with great respect

  sir 

   schweighauser of nantes  who is a native of switzerland  observing
me as i was one day at his house looking with some attention upon a
stamp of the heroic deed of william tell  asked me to take a few of
them to america  as a present from him  which i agreed to do with
pleasure  he accordingly sent on board the frigate a box containing 
as he told me  one stamp for each state  neatly framed and glazed 
which he desired me to present to congress  as a small token of his
respect  the box has never been opened  but i hope the pictures are
safe  and with permission of congress i will deliver it to the navy
board in boston  to be by them transmitted to the delegates from the
several states  or to their order 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect

so many advantages might be derived to the united states in the
conduct of the war  in furnishing the army and navy  in augmenting the
value  or at least in preventing the further depreciation of their
currency  in lowering the prices of goods  in supplying the wants of
the people  and in preventing murmurs and discontents  that i have
ever thought it of very great importance  in some way or other  to
procure convoys to their trade  to and from the west india islands 
and europe 

france and spain have such advantages of england in carrying on the
war in the american seas  and would receive such assistance from our
commerce  privateers  and growing navy  that i have ever thought it a
main principle of their policy to maintain a constant and decided
superiority of naval power in the west indies  and upon the coasts of
this continent  i would  therefore  with due deference to the superior
wisdom of congress  beg leave to submit to their consideration 
whether it would not be expedient for them  either by a direct
representation from themselves to the french and spanish courts  or by
instructions to their plenipotentiary ministers  to convince those
courts  that their true interest lies in adopting this plan  it is
certainly their interest  reasoning upon french and spanish principles
simply  to conduct this war in such a manner as has a tendency in the
shortest time  and with the least expense  to diminish the power of
their enemies  and increase their own  now i would submit it to
congress whether it may not be easily demonstrated  that these ends
may be obtained the most easily in this way  a representation from
congress  either directly or by instructions to their ministers 
showing what assistance in provisions  artists  materials  vessels of
war  privateers  land armies  or in any other way  france and spain
might depend upon receiving from these states  either for money or as
the exertions of an ally  would have great weight 

much has been already said to the french ministry upon these subjects 
and not wholly without effect  yet much more may be said to greater
advantage  and perhaps to better purpose  for they are extremely well
disposed to do what can be made to appear to them for the advantage of
the common cause 

i have the honor to enclose some papers on this subject  one is a
letter from the commissioners to his excellency the count de
vergennes  which he received the beginning of january last  51  the
other is a letter from me to the marquis de lafayette 52  in february 
with his answer 

  i have the honor to be

  my dear sir 

your favor of the 4th of this month gave me great pleasure  but i am
afraid that you and some others of my friends felt more for me in the
awkward situation you mention than i did for myself  though i cannot
say that i was wholly insensible  i could compare it to nothing  but
shakspeare   idea of ariel  wedged in the middle of a rifted oak  for
i was sufficiently sensible  that it was owing to an unhappy division
in congress  and pains enough were taken to inform me  that one side
were for sending me to spain  and the other to holland  so that i was
flattered to find that neither side had any decisive objection against
trusting me  and that the apparent question was only  where  

that i was sent without the least solicitation of mine  directly or
indirectly  is certainly true  and i had such formidable ideas of the
sea and of british men of war  such diffidence in my own
qualifications to do service in that way  and such uncertainty of the
reception i should meet  that i had little inclination to adventure 
that i went against my interest is most undoubtedly so  for i never
yet served the public without losing by it  i was not  however  as you
suppose  kept unemployed  i had business enough to do  as i could
easily convince you  there is a great field of business there  and i
could easily show you that i did my share of it  there is so much to
do  and so much difficulty to do it well  that i am rejoiced to find a
gentleman of such abilities  principles  and activity as colonel
laurens undoubtedly is  without a compliment  appointed to assist in
it  53  i most sincerely hope for his friendship  and an entire
harmony with him  for which reason i should be very happy in his
company in the passage  or in an interview with him as soon as
possible in europe  he will be in a delicate situation  but not so
much so as i was  and plain sense  honest intentions  and common
civility will  i think  be sufficient to secure him  and do much good 

your kind compliments on my safe return and most honorable re election
are very obliging  i have received no commission  nor instructions 
nor any particular information of the plan  but from the advice and
information from you and several other of my friends at philadelphia
and here  i shall make no hesitation to say  that  notwithstanding the
delicacy and danger of this commission  i suppose i shall accept it
without delay and trust events to heaven  as i have been long used to
do 

the convulsions at philadelphia are very affecting and alarming  but
not entirely unexpected to me  the state of parties  and the nature of
their government  have a long time given me disagreeable
apprehensions  but i hope they will find some remedy  methods will be
found to feed the army  but i know of none to clothe it without
convoys to trade  which congress  i think  will do well to undertake 
and persuade france and spain to undertake as soon as possible  your
packets for your friends in europe will give me pleasure  and shall be
forwarded with care and despatch 

  with great truth and regard  i am

  sir 

i had yesterday the honor of receiving your letter of the 20th of
october  enclosed with two commissions  appointing me minister
plenipotentiary from the united states  to negotiate peace and
commerce with great britain  together with instructions for my
government in the execution of these commissions  copies of
instructions to the ministers plenipotentiary at versailles and
madrid  and two acts of congress of the 4th and 15th of october 

peace is an object of such vast importance  the interests to be
adjusted in the negotiations to obtain it are so complicated and so
delicate  and the difficulty of giving even general satisfaction is so
great  that i feel myself more distressed at the prospect of executing
the trust  than at the thought of leaving my country  and again
encountering the dangers of the seas and of enemies  yet  when i
reflect on the general voice in my favor  and the high honor that is
done me by this appointment  i feel the warmest sentiments of
gratitude to congress  and shall make no hesitation to accept it  and
devote myself without reserve or loss of time to the discharge of it 
my success  however  may depend  in a very great degree  on the
intelligence and advices that i may receive from time to time from
congress  and on the punctuality with which several articles in my
instructions may be kept secret  it shall be my most earnest endeavor
to transmit to congress the most constant and exact information in my
power of whatever may occur  and to conceal those instructions  which
depend in any measure on my judgment  and i hope i need not suggest to
congress the necessity of communicating to me  as early as possible 
their commands from time to time  and of keeping all the discretionary
articles an impenetrable secret  a suggestion  however  that the
constitution of that sovereignty  which i have the honor to represent 
might excuse 

as the frigate has been some time waiting  i shall embark in eight or
ten days at furthest  your excellency will please to present my most
dutiful respects to congress  and accept my thanks for the polite and
obliging manner in which you have communicated their commands 

  i have the honor to be

      instructions for a treaty of peace with great britain  54 

footnote 

   54  these instructions  and those for a treaty of commerce which
  follow were agreed to unanimously in congress on the 14th of august 
  nearly six weeks before the minister was chosen  they were drawn up by
  gouverneur morris 

sir 

you will herewith receive a commission  giving you full power to
negotiate a treaty of peace with great britain  in doing which you
will conform to the following information and instructions 

1  the united states are sincerely desirous of peace  and wish by
every means  consistent with their dignity and safety  to spare the
further effusion of blood  they have  therefore  by your commission
and these instructions  labored to remove the obstacles to that event 
before the enemy have evidenced their disposition for it  but as the
great object of the present defensive war  on the part of the allies 
is to establish the independence of the united states  and as any
treaty whereby this end cannot be obtained must be only ostensible and
illusory  you are  therefore  to make it a preliminary article to any
negotiation  that great britain shall agree to treat with the united
states  as sovereign  free  and independent 

2  you shall take especial care also  that the independence of the
said states be effectually assured and confirmed by the treaty or
treaties of peace  according to the form and effect of the treaty of
alliance with his most christian majesty  and you shall not agree to
such treaty or treaties  unless the same be thereby so assured and
confirmed 

3  the boundaries of these states are as follows  viz  these states
are bounded north  by a line to be drawn from the northwest angle of
nova scotia along the highlands  which divide those rivers which empty
themselves into the river st lawrence  from those which fall into the
atlantic ocean  to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river 
thence down along the middle of that river to the fortyfifth degree of
north latitude  thence due west in the latitude fortyfive degrees
north from the equator to the northwesternmost side of the river st
lawrence or cadaraqui  thence straight to the south end of nepissing 
and thence straight to the source of the river mississippi  west  by a
line to be drawn along the middle of the river mississippi from its
source to where the said line shall intersect the thirtyfirst degree
of north latitude  south  by a line to be drawn due east  from the
termination of the line last mentioned in the latitude of thirtyone
degrees north from the equator to the middle of the river
appalachicola  or catahouchi  thence along the middle thereof to its
junction with the flint river  thence straight to the head of st
mary   river  and thence down along the middle of st mary   river to
the atlantic ocean  and east  by a line to be drawn along the middle
of st john   river from its source to its mouth in the bay of fundy 
comprehending all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the
shores of the united states  and lying between lines to be drawn due
east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between nova
scotia on the one part  and east florida on the other part  shall
respectively touch the bay of fundy and the atlantic ocean  you are 
therefore  strongly to contend that the whole of the said countries
and islands lying within the boundaries aforesaid  and every citadel 
fort  post  place  harbor  and road to them belonging  be absolutely
evacuated by the land and sea forces of his britannic majesty  and
yielded to the powers of the states to which they respectively belong 
in such situation as they may be at the termination of the war  but 
notwithstanding the clear right of these states  and the importance of
the object  yet they are so much influenced by the dictates of
religion and humanity  and so desirous of complying with the earnest
request of their allies  that if the line to be drawn from the mouth
of the lake nepissing to the head of the mississippi cannot be
obtained without continuing the war for that purpose  you are hereby
empowered to agree to some other line between that point and the river
mississippi  provided the same shall in no part thereof be to the
southward of latitude fortyfive degrees north  and in like manner  if
the eastern boundary above described cannot be obtained  you are
hereby empowered to agree  that the same shall be afterwards adjusted 
by commissioners to be duly appointed for that purpose  according to
such line as shall be by them settled and agreed on  as the boundary
between that part of the state of massachusetts bay  formerly called
the province of maine  and the colony of nova scotia  agreeably to
their respective rights  and you may also consent  that the enemy
shall destroy such fortifications as they may have erected 

3  although it is of the utmost importance to the peace and commerce
of the united states that canada and nova scotia should be ceded  and
more particularly that their equal common right to the fisheries
should be guarantied to them  yet a desire of terminating the war has
induced us not to make the acquisition of these objects an ultimatum
on the present occasion 

5  you are empowered to agree to a cessation of hostilities during the
negotiation  provided our ally shall consent to the same  and provided
it shall be stipulated that all the forces of the enemy shall be
immediately withdrawn from the united states 

6  in all other matters not abovementioned  you are to govern yourself
by the alliance between his most christian majesty and these states 
by the advice of our allies  by your knowledge of our interests  and
by your own discretion  in which we repose the fullest confidence 

                                                   

        instructions for a treaty of commerce with great britain 

sir 

you will herewith receive a commission  giving you full power to
negotiate a treaty of commerce with great britain  in doing which  you
will consider yourself bound by the following information and
instructions 

1  you will govern yourself principally by the treaty of commerce with
his most christian majesty  and as  on the one hand  you shall grant
no privilege to great britain not granted by that treaty to france 
so  on the other  you shall not consent to any peculiar restrictions
or limitations whatever in favor of great britain 

2  in order that you may be the better able to act with propriety on
this occasion  it is necessary for you to know  that we have
determined  1st  that the common right of fishing shall in no case be
given up  2dly  that it is essential to the welfare of all these
united states that the inhabitants thereof  at the expiration of the
war  should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of
their common right to fish on the banks of newfoundland  and the
other fishing banks and seas of north america  preserving inviolate
the treaties between france and the said states  3dly  that
application shall be made to his most christian majesty to agree to
some article or articles for the better securing to these states a
share in the said fisheries  4thly  that if  after a treaty of peace
with great britain  she shall molest the citizens or inhabitants of
any of the united states  in taking fish on the banks and places
hereinafter described  such molestation  being in our opinion a direct
violation and breach of the peace  shall be a common cause of the said
states  and the force of the union be exerted to obtain redress for
the parties injured  and 5thly  that our faith be pledged to the
several states  that  without their unanimous consent  no treaty of
commerce shall be entered into  nor any trade or commerce carried on
with great britain  without the explicit stipulation hereinafter
mentioned  you are therefore not to consent to any treaty of commerce
with great britain without an explicit stipulation on her part  not to
molest or disturb the inhabitants of the united states of america in
taking fish on the banks of newfoundland and other fisheries in the
american seas anywhere  excepting within the distance of three leagues
of the shores of the territories remaining to great britain at the
close of the war  if a nearer distance cannot be obtained by
negotiation  and in the negotiation you are to exert your most
strenuous endeavors to obtain a nearer distance to the gulf of st
lawrence  and particularly along the shores of nova scotia  as to
which latter we are desirous that even the shores may be occasionally
used for the purpose of carrying on the fisheries by the inhabitants
of these states 

in all matters you are to govern yourself by your own discretion  as
shall be most for the interest of these states  taking care that the
said treaty be founded on principles of equality and reciprocity  so
as to conduce to the mutual advantage of both nations  but not to the
exclusion of others

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress a copy of the letter book of
the commissioners at the court of versailles  during the time i had
the honor to be one of them  as the letter book was kept by me  and
almost wholly in my hand writing  the minister plenipotentiary
consented  that i should bring it home with me  leaving him a copy 
which was done 

as there may be many things in it which congress may have occasion to
know  i have prevailed with mr thaxter to copy it  i shall submit to
the consideration of congress  whether he ought to have any allowance
for this service  and how much  as mr thaxter will accompany me to
europe  in the character of my private secretary  if congress think
proper to allow him anything for these copies  i can pay him in europe
if it is thought proper 

i chose to mention mr thaxter   going with me to congress  because
jealousies have arisen heretofore concerning private secretaries  mr
thaxter is known to congress  and i think i can safely confide in his
fidelity  diligence  and discretion  and from the experience i have
had in europe i am fully convinced  that it is my duty to take with me
some one of this character 

i have the honor to be  with great respect

  sir 

i have the honor to inform your excellency  that  congress having
judged it proper to appoint me to a new mission in europe  i embarked
on the 13th of november  at the instance of the chevalier de la
luzerne and    gerard  on board the same frigate  that carried me to
america  soon after we got to sea  a formidable leak in the ship
discovered itself  so as to oblige us to keep two pumps constantly
going by night and day  which induced the captain to think it
necessary to put into this place  where we have just now cast anchor 
whether i shall go to paris by land or wait for the frigate is
uncertain  i believe the former  as the latter might detain me four or
five weeks  i have despatches for your excellency from congress  which
i shall carry with me  and newspapers  these latter contain little
remarkable save the evacuation of rhode island by the enemy  and the
count   estaing   progress in georgia  in co operation with general
lincoln  which was in a fair course of success 

i hope the confederacy  which sailed from philadelphia three or four
weeks before us  with    gerard and mr jay  who is appointed minister
plenipotentiary for spain  has happily arrived  and made it
unnecessary for me to enlarge upon the general state of affairs in
america  which were upon the whole in a favorable train  i hope to
have the honor of saluting you at passy in a few weeks  and am  with
great respect  sir  your most obedient humble servant

                     to the president of congress 

                                          ferrol  december 11th  1779 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that on the 13th of november i
embarked on board the french frigate  la sensible  and on the 14th
came on board mr francis dana  the secretary to my commission  when we
fell down to king   roads  and on the 15th we sailed for france 

a leak was soon discovered in the ship  which obliged us to ply the
pumps  as it seemed a steady leak  it gave little alarm at first  but
continuing to increase to such a degree as to make two pumps
constantly necessary night and day  obliging the passengers to take
their turns in common with the ship   people  the captain judged it
necessary to make the first port he could find  accordingly  on the
7th of december  we happily discovered cape finisterre  and on the 8th
arrived in the magnificent spanish port of ferrol  where we found a
squadron of french ships of the line  the officers of which think we
were very happy in making this port  as the frigate  since she has
been in this harbor  is found to make seven or eight feet of water an
hour 

the advice of all the gentlemen here is to make the best of my way to
paris by land  as it is the opinion of many  that the frigate will be
condemned  but if not  she certainly will not be ready to sail again
from this port in less than four or five weeks 

this is unfortunate to me  because  by all the information i can
obtain  travelling in this kingdom is attended with many difficulties
and delays  as well as a very great expense  there being no regular
posts as in france  and no possibility of passing over the mountainous
part of this country in carriages 

i find there has been no engagement in the european seas between the
english and the combined fleets of france and spain  as was reported
in america  there has been an epidemic sickness on board the french
fleet  which caused it to return rather sooner than was intended 
there are twentyfive spanish ships of the line in brest harbor with
the french  it is reported that    du chaffault is appointed commander
in chief of the french fleet  and that the count   orvilliers has
retired 

captain jones has done another brilliant action  by taking a fortyfour
gun ship  after an obstinate engagement  which he carried into the
texel  but i cannot learn the particulars with much certainty or
exactness 

i have been treated with the utmost attention and politeness since my
arrival in this place  both by the spanish and french officers 
particularly by the spanish lieutenant general of marine  don joseph
st vincent  who is commander in chief of the marine  by    de sade 
the french  chef   escadré   and by the french consul and vice consul 
who have all obligingly offered me every assistance in their power 

i shall endeavor to inform congress of every step of my progress  as i
may find opportunity  i have heard nothing as yet  which makes it
probable to me  that i shall have anything to do openly and directly 
in pursuance of my commission very speedily  there is a confused rumor
here of a mediation of russia and holland  but i am persuaded without
foundation  it seems to be much more certain  that the english
continue in their old ill humor and insolent language  notwithstanding
their impotence grows every day more apparent 

i have the honor to be

                     to the president of congress 

                                         corunna  december 16th  1779 

  sir 

by the opportunity of a small vessel accidentally in this harbor 
bound to newburyport  i have the honor to inform congress that i have
been detained by violent rains  and several accidents  in ferrol until
yesterday  when i set out with my family for this place  and arrived
last evening without any accident  i awaited immediately on the
governor of the province  and on the governor of the town  and
received many civilities from both  and particularly from his
excellency the governor of the province of galicia  an assurance that
he was not only disposed personally to render me every hospitality and
assistance in his power  but that he had received express orders from
his court  to treat all americans who should arrive here like their
best friends  these personages were very inquisitive about american
affairs  particularly the progress of our arms  and the operations of
the count   estaing  and more particularly still about the appointment
of a minister plenipotentiary to the court of madrid  they requested
his name  character  nativity  age  whether he was a member of
congress  and whether he had been president  with many other
particulars 

to all these questions i made the best answers in my power  and with
regard to his excellency  the minister plenipotentiary at the court
of madrid  i gave them the most exact information  and such a
respectable character as the high offices he has sustained  and his
own personal merit require  it is the prevailing opinion here  that
the court of madrid is well disposed to enter into a treaty with the
united states  and that the minister from congress will be immediately
received  american independence acknowledged  and a treaty concluded 
the frigate la sensible is found to be in so bad a condition  that i
am advised by everybody to go to france by land  the season  the
roads  the accommodations for travelling are so unfavorable  that it
is not expected i can get to paris in less than thirty days  but if i
were to wait for the frigate  it would probably be much longer  i am
determined  therefore  to make the best of my way by land  and it is
possible that this journey may prove of some service to the public 
although it will be tedious and expensive to me  at least  i hope the
public will sustain no loss by it 

there are six battalions of irish troops in spain  in three regiments 
several of whose officers have visited me to assure me of their regard
to the united states  i have been this afternoon to the tower de fer
to see the island of cezarga  which was rendered famous in the course
of the last summer by being appointed the rendezvous of the french and
spanish fleets  the french fleet arrived at this island on the 9th of
june last  but were not joined by the spanish fleet from ferrol  till
some time in july  nor by the fleet from cadiz till much later  so
that the combined fleets were not able to sail for the english
channel  until the 30th of july  to prevent a similar inconvenience
another campaign  there are about twentyfive spanish ships of the line
now in brest  which are to winter there  and to be ready to sail with
the french fleets the approaching summer  at the first opening of the
season 

god grant them success and triumph  although no man wishes for peace
more sincerely than i  or would take more pleasure  or think himself
more highly honored in being instrumental in bringing it about  yet  i
confess  i see no prospect or hope of it  at least before the end of
another summer  america will be amused with rumors of peace  and
europe too  but the english are not yet in a temper for it 

the court of russia has lately changed its ambassador at the court of
london  and sometime in the month of october     simolin  the new
minister plenipotentiary from the court of petersburg to the court of
london  passed through france in his way to england  and resided three
weeks in paris  from this circumstance  a report has been spread in
europe  that the court of russia is about to undertake the office of
mediator between the belligerent powers  but from conversation with
several persons of distinction since my arrival in spain  particularly
with the count de sade  the chef   escadré  commanding the french men
of war now in ferrol  i am persuaded  that if russia has any thoughts
of a mediation  the independence of the united states will be insisted
upon by her as a preliminary  and great britain will feel much more
reluctance to agree to this  than to the cession of gibraltar  which
it is said spain absolutely insists upon 

i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the governor of corunna 

                                         corunna  december 18th  1779 

mr adams presents his compliments to the governor of corunna  and
informs him  according to his desire expressed last evening  that the
names of the persons for whom he requests a passport from his
excellency  the governor of this province  are as follows 

john adams  a minister plenipotentiary from the united states of
america 

francis dana  secretary to mr adams   commission  a member of
congress  and a member of the council of massachusetts bay 

john thaxter  private secretary to mr adams 

john quincy adams  a son of mr adams  about twelve years of age 

charles adams  another son of mr adams  nearly ten years of age 

jeremiah allen of boston  in massachusetts  a private gentleman
accidentally in company  he is a merchant travelling with the view of
establishing a private commerce in spain  as well as france 

samuel cooper johonnot  ten or eleven years of age  a grandson of a
particular friend of mr adams in boston  going to paris for an
education in the university there 

joseph stevens  a servant of mr adams 

john william christian frieke  a servant of mr dana 

andrew desmia  a servant of mr allen 

mr adams requests a passport for all these persons to go to madrid 
and from thence to bilboa  and from thence to bayonne  in their way to
paris  with liberty at the same time to go directly to bayonne by the
nearest road  without going to madrid  or to bilboa  as it is
uncertain whether mr adams will have the time to gratify his
inclination with the sight of those cities

                                      versailles  december 31st  1779 

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write to me
on the 6th of october last 

i was well persuaded  that    de chavagne 55  would endeavor to
procure for you everything in his power to render your passage
agreeable  this was conformable to the instructions i had given him
respecting the intentions of the king 

i learn with pleasure  that  being again charged with an important
mission by congress  you will be able to profit by the frigate
sensible a second time in your voyage to france 

i have the honor to be     

                                                           de sartine

   55  these instructions  and those for a treaty of commerce which
  follow were agreed to unanimously in congress on the 14th of august 
  nearly six weeks before the minister was chosen  they were drawn up by
  gouverneur morris 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                           bilboa  january 16th  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that last night  and not before 
i arrived at this place 

at ferrol and corunna i was advised by all the friends of america  to
undertake a journey by land  the consul of france and    lagoanere  a
gentleman who has acted for some time as the american agent at
corunna  obligingly offered me all the assistance in their power  and
accordingly used their utmost diligence to procure me the necessary
mules and carriages  for the transportation of the small number of
persons in company with me  and the small quantity of baggage we found
it indispensably necessary to take with us  having left more than two
thirds of what we had with us to take the chance of a passage by sea
to france  from the 8th of december  when we arrived at ferrol  to the
26th of the same month  when we set off from corunna  we were detained
by the violent rains  and the impossibility of getting accommodations
for travelling  all our beds and provisions we were obliged to carry
with us  we travelled through the ancient kingdoms of galicia  leon 
old castile  and biscay  and although we made the best of our way
without loss of time  we found it impossible to go more than eight
leagues a day  and sometimes not more than four  the roads and inns
are inconvenient to a degree that i should blush to describe  and the
pain we suffered in a cold season of the year for want of fire  in a
country where there are no chimnies  gave us all such violent colds 
that i was under great apprehensions of our being seized with fevers 

as we were so near madrid  within about forty leagues  i balanced some
time in my own mind  whether to go to that fine city  but considering
that this would lengthen our journey near a hundred leagues  the
severe season of the year  and above all the political situation that
i might be in  my country not being yet acknowledged as a sovereign
state by any formal act of that court  it being known  that another
gentleman had a commission for that court  and he being expected soon
to arrive  i thought it upon the whole the least hazardous to the
public interest to avoid that route 

it may be of some use to my countrymen to transmit a few observations
upon the country i have passed through  because it appears to me that
a commerce extremely advantageous to both countries may be opened
between us and spain  as soon as our independence shall be
acknowledged by that power  at least as soon as we shall obtain the
great object of all our wishes  peace 

the province of galicia is one of the largest in spain  and said to be
one of the best peopled  corunna is in effect the principal city 
although st jago  in respect to its patron saint  or more probably to
the archbishop who resides there  is in name the capital  this
province  one of those whereof the ancient crown of castile was
formed  is washed by the ocean for more than seventy leagues from
ribadeo  on the frontiers of asturias  to the mouth of the river
minks  which separates it from portugal  this coast  which is divided
by cape finisterre  is provided on both sides of the cape with ports
equally safe and convenient  which nature seems to have prepared
around this cape  an object oftentimes so necessary to be made by
navigators  both at their departure from europe  and at their return 
as so many asylums both from the apprehensions and the consequences of
storms  the most known of these ports are ribadeo  ferrol  corunna 
and camarinas  to the eastward of cape finisterre  corubios  muros 
pontevidia  and vigo to the westward  all proper to receive vessels of
the first rate  especially ferrol and vigo  the first  the most
considerable department of the marine of spain  is embellished with
everything that art and the treasures  profusely spent upon it for
thirty years past  could add to its happy situation  vigo  represented
to be one of the most beautiful ports in the world  is another
department of the marine  more extensive and proper  for such an
establishment than ferrol itself  besides these ports  there are a
multitude of harbors and bays round cape finisterre  which afford a
safe and convenient shelter to merchant vessels  with all these
advantages for foreign commerce  this province has very little but
what is passive  it receives from abroad some objects of daily
consumption  some of luxury  some of convenience  and some even of the
first necessity  at present it offers little for exportation to
foreign countries  the sardiné of its coast  the famous fish which it
furnishes to all spain  the cattle which it fattens for the provision
of madrid  and a few coarse linens which are its only manufacture  and
are well esteemed  are the objects of its active commerce  and form
its balance with the other provinces  the wine and the grain  the
chief productions of its lands  seldom suffice for its consumption 
and never go beyond it 

the liberty of commerce with the windward islands  granted by the
court within a few years  and the particular establishment of     
opened the ports of that part of the new world to this province  and
although without manufactures herself  or any of those productions
proper for america  she renders to foreign hands the product of those
which she receives from them and carries thither  in this circulation
of so many treasures  she enriches herself with parts that she
detaches from the whole 

the civil government of this province is formed by a superior tribunal
called the  audience   to which an appeal lies from all the subaltern
jurisdictions  public and private  this court hears and determines 
as sovereign and without appeal  all civil affairs of a less value
than a thousand ducats  or three thousand livres  appeals in those
which exceed that value are carried to the chancery of valladolid  or
to the council of castile  although justice is gratis on the part of
the judges  who are paid by the government  it is said to be not less
costly  tedious  and vexatious  it may not be useless to observe that
the criminal chambers  whose decrees extend to the punishment of
death  and are executed without any application to the king or any
other authority  is composed only of three judges  and these three are
the youngest of the whole tribunal  and this order is generally
followed in spain in the composition of the criminal tribunals 
although no one pretends to conjecture the motive of so singular a
reverse of the rational order of things  the administration of the
royal police belongs also to the audience  and forms the third chamber
into which this tribunal is divided 

all the military authority  and the government of the troops in this
department  are in the hands of the captain general of the province 
there is not any one under him who has even the title of commandant 
but in case of his death or absence  he is succeeded by the general
officer  the most ancient in the province  to this title of captain
general is added  commonly  that of president of the audience  a
prerogative which  by uniting in his hands the civil authority to all
that of his place  gives a power the most absolute and unlimited 

the inspection general  and all the economy of the affairs of the king
in the province  belong to the intendant  the different branches of
the public revenue are all administered by officers appointed by the
king  as in the rest of the kingdom  and there are no farmers general
as in france  their product is about twentysix millions of reals  or
six millions five hundred thousand livres  the expense of collection
being deducted  the expenses of the administration  including the
maintenance of three regiments of infantry scattered about in
different places  do not exceed two millions five hundred thousand
livres  the surplus goes into the dry docks  arsenals  and fund of
fortifications  to the support of which this sum is far from being
sufficient  such is in general the government  military  political 
and civil of this province  and nearly pf all the others  except
biscay  guipuscoa  and alaba 

there is not in this province any particular jurisdiction of commerce 
but there is a tribunal  under the name of the judge considerator of
commerce  which takes cognizance of all their causes  civil and
criminal  except the case of contraband  at this day  the judge
considerator of strangers is the governor of the province himself  and
the appeals from his judgment are carried directly to the council of
war  which is said to be a precious privilege  by the form and brevity
of procedure compared with the expensive and insupportable delays of
the ordinary jurisdiction 

i cannot but think that if some measures could be taken to convince
the court  that it is their interest to take off the vast duties with
which commerce is overloaded in this port  fifteen per cent being to
be paid upon all commodities exported and upon all imported  and if
the rigid prohibitions of tobacco could be relaxed or repealed 
several of the productions of america would find a good market here 
and a commerce be opened that would put a new face upon this province 
and be profitable to america too  the conveniency of such a number of
excellent ports would be a vast advantage  which bilboa cannot have 
as her harbor is neither safe nor convenient  besides its being so
much further down the stormy  turbulent gulf of biscay  yet biscay 
which is commonly used to comprehend biscay proper  the principal city
of which is bilboa  although orduna is the capital  guipuscoa  the
capital of which is st sebastian  and alaba  the capital of which is
vittoria  three free provinces  whose laws the kings of spain have
hitherto been sworn to observe inviolate  have attracted almost the
whole of the american trade  because the king has no custom house or
officers here  and there are no duties to be paid 

it may seem surprising to hear of free provinces in spain  but such is
the fact  that the high and independent spirit of the people  so
essentially different from the other provinces  that a traveller
perceives it even in their countenances  their dress  their air  and
their ordinary manner of speech  has induced the spanish nation and
her kings to respect the ancient liberties of these people so far 
that each monarch at his accession to the throne takes an oath to
observe the laws of biscay  the government here is therefore
diametrically opposite to that of galicia  and the other provinces 
the king of spain has never assumed any higher title than lord of
biscay  he has no troops of any sort in the lordship  nor is there any
standing array  instead of which every man is obliged to serve in the
militia  the king has no custom house officers  nor other revenue
officers  nor any other officers whatsoever in the lordship except a
corregidor  and lately a commissary of marine  this last is considered
as an encroachment and a grievance  and the authority of the
corregidor is very small  as there lies an appeal from his judgment
to another tribunal  that of the two deputy generals  who are
biennially elected by the people  few of the grandees of spain have
any considerable estates here  the duke of medina coeli  and the duke
of berwick  have some lands here of no great value  the lands 
generally  belong to the inhabitants and possessors  who hold them of
no lord but the king of spain  who is lord of biscay 

there is a board of trade here  which is annually instituted by the
merchants of the place  partly by lot and partly by election  which
decides all controversies arising in trade  and all the affairs of
strangers  they have never admitted any foreign consul to reside here 
although it has been solicited by holland  england  and france 

it is not at all surprising  that a constitution in its nature so
favorable to commerce  should have succeeded 

in travelling through the provinces of leon and castile  and observing
the numerous flocks of sheep  with the most beautiful fleeces of wool
in the world  i could not but wish that some communication might be
opened  by which the united states of america might be furnished with
this necessary article from this country  there are few of our
articles of exportation but might be sent to the spanish market to
advantage  rice  pitch  tar  turpentine  tobacco  wheat  flour  ship
timber  masts  yards  bowsprits  and salt fish might be supplied to
spain  and at an advantage  and in return  she might furnish us wine 
oil  fruits  some silks  some linens  perhaps  and with any quantity
of wool  which is now exported to foreign countries for manufacture 
and might as well be sent to us  but above all with silver and gold 

it must be the work of time and a free intercourse between the two
nations  and a future negotiation to ripen these hints into a plan
that may be beneficial to both  the system of revenue  which it is
dangerous and difficult to alter in spain  as well as in all other
countries of europe  will be the principal objection  i have collected
together with some difficulty a few gazettes  which i have the honor
to transmit to congress  from which all the news may be collected that
i have been able to learn  congress will easily perceive the eagerness
with which the belligerent powers are bent on war  without manifesting
the least disposition for peace  and most of all  great britain  whose
ostentatious display of trifling successes  and whose weak exultation
shows  that nothing can divert her from her furious course  but she is
exhausting and sinking her forces every day  without gaining any
lasting or solid advantage  and she has reason to fear  from the
combined fleets of france and spain  under such enterprising 
experienced  and approved officers  as   estaing and du chaffault  the
entire ruin of her commerce and navy in the course of a campaign or
two more 

  i have the honor to be

                                             paris  february 12  1780 

  sir 

having obtained permission from your excellency yesterday  when i did
myself the honor to wait on you at versailles  to write on the subject
of my mission  i have now the honor to acquaint you  that on the 29th
day of september last the congress of the united states of america did
me the honor to elect me their plenipotentiary to negotiate a peace
with great britain  and also to negotiate a treaty of commerce with
that kingdom  and mr francis dana  member of congress  and of the
council of massachusetts bay  secretary to both commissions 

as i was not at congress when this transaction took place  i am not
able to inform your excellency very particularly of the rise and
progress of it  but from conversation with gentlemen at boston  who
were members of congress  and from private letters  i learned in
general  that it was not the result of any sudden deliberation  or the
fruit of any particular event of the war  prosperous or adverse  but a
measure that has been more than a year under consideration  and
finally agreed to on this principle  that as it was uncertain at what
time the belligerent powers might be disposed to treat of peace  which
could not be concluded without a minister from the united states  it
would save a great deal of time for this power to have a minister in
europe fully authorised to treat  and in concert with ministers from
the other powers at war  conclude a peace with great britain  and a
treaty of commerce consistent with that already made with his most
christian majesty  and such others as might be made with other powers 
i am persuaded it is the intention of my constituents and of all
america  and i am sure it is my own determination  to take no steps of
consequence in pursuance of my commissions  without consulting his
majesty   ministers  and as various conjectures have been  and may be
made concerning the nature of my appointment and powers  and as it may
be expected by some  that i should take some measures for announcing
these to the public  or at least to the court of london  i beg the
favor of your excellency   opinion and advice upon these questions 

1  whether  in the present state of things  it is prudent in me to
acquaint the british ministry that i am arrived here  and that i shall
be ready to treat  whenever the belligerent powers shall be inclined
to treat 

2  whether it is prudent in me to publish in any manner  more than the
journals of congress may have already done  the nature of my mission 

3  or whether to remain on the reserve  as i have hitherto done since
my arrival in europe 

if any propositions should be made to me directly or indirectly from
the british ministry  i shall not fail to communicate them without
loss of time to your excellency  and i beg the favor of your
excellency  as i am the only person in europe who has authority to
treat of peace  that if any propositions on the part of great britain
should be made to his majesty   ministers  that they may be
communicated to me  at least as far as they may relate to the interest
of the united states 

although i am not confined by commissions  nor instructions  nor by
any intimations from congress to reside in any one place in europe
more than another  yet my own inclinations as well as those of the
public would be most gratified  and the public service most promoted 
by my residing here  i must  therefore  request his majesty  
protection and permission to reside in this kingdom for some time 
with or without assuming any public character  as your excellency may
think most advisable 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams

                                           paris  february 13th  1780 

  sir 

it was not until my arrival at passy  that i had the honor of your
excellency   letter of the 31st of december last 

when his majesty   intentions of granting me a passage to america were
communicated to me  i had little expectation of returning in the same
frigate  but the congress having honored me with a fresh mission to
europe  their excellencies  the late and present ministers from his
majesty to the united states  concurred in a proposal to congress  and
a requisition to the commander of the frigate  to afford me a passage
in her voyage home  which captain chavagne agreed to with particular
marks of politeness to me and mr dana  and the others who accompanied
me 

i have again to express to your excellency the obligations i am under
to the captain  and all the officers of the sensible  for their
goodness to me and mine  but it is more particularly my duty to
express again my thanks to his majesty  for this fresh favor  to   
gerard and the chevalier de la luzerne  who procured it for me  and to
your excellency  for your approbation of it 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams

                                      versailles  february 15th  1780 

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on
the 12th of this month  i think before i reply to the different
points on which you consult me  that it is proper to wait for the
arrival of    gerard  because he is probably the bearer of your
instructions  and will certainly be able to make me better acquainted
with the nature and extent of your commission  but in the mean time  i
am of opinion  that it will be prudent to conceal your eventual
character  and above all to take the necessary precautions  that the
object of your commission may remain unknown to the court of london 
besides  sir  you may be assured  that his majesty sees you with
pleasure in his dominions  that you will constantly enjoy his
protection  and the prerogatives of the law of nations  for my own
part  sir  i shall be eager to give you proofs of my confidence  as
well as of the sentiments with which i have the honor to be     

                                                         de vergennes 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 15th  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that on the 9th of this month 
and not before  i had the good fortune to arrive in this city  from
ferrol  where i arrived on the 8th of december  with mr dana  mr
thaxter  and the rest of the company in tolerable health  after a
journey of near five hundred leagues  in the dead of winter  through
bad roads  and worse accommodations of every kind  we lost no time
more than was indispensably necessary to restore our health  which was
several times affected  and in great danger  yet we were more than
twice as long in making the journey by land  as we had been in
crossing the atlantic ocean 

the next morning after our arrival at paris  mr dana and myself went
out to passy  and spent the day with his excellency dr franklin  who
did us the honor the next day to accompany us to versailles  where we
had the honor to wait on their excellencies the count de vergennes    
de sartine  and the count maurepas  with each of whom we had the honor
of a short conference  upon the state of public affairs  it is
sufficient for me to say in general  that i never heard the french
ministry so frank  so explicit  so decided  as each of these gentlemen
was in the course of this conversation  in his declarations to persue
the war with vigor  and to afford effectual aid to the united states 
i learned with great satisfaction  that they are sending  under
convoy  clothing and arms for fifteen thousand men to america  that
seventeen ships of the line were already gone to the west indies 
under    de guichen  and that five or six more at least are to follow 
in addition to ten or twelve they have already there  i asked
permission of the count de vergennes to write to him on the subject of
my mission  which he cheerfully and politely agreed to  i have
accordingly written to his excellency  and shall forward copies of my
letter and his answer  as soon as it may be safe to do it 

the english are to borrow twelve millions this year  and it is said 
that the loan is filled up  they have thrown a sop to ireland  but
have not appeased her rage  they give out exactly such threats as they
did last year  and every other year  of terrible preparations  but
congress knows perfectly well how these measures have been
accomplished  they will not be more fully executed the next year than
the last  and if france and spain should throw more of their force 
especially by sea  into america the next year  america will have no
essential injury to fear 

i have learned since my arrival at paris  with the highest pleasure 
the arrival of    gerard  mr jay  and mr carmichael  at cadiz  for
whose safety we had been under great apprehensions  i have now very
solid hopes  that a treaty will soon be concluded with spain  hopes
which everything that i saw and heard seemed to favor 

the alliance frigate  now under the command of captain jones  with
captain cunningham on board  is arrived at corunna  where she is to be
careened  after which she is to return to   orient  and from thence to
go to america  as i am informed by dr franklin 

mr auther lee  and mr izard  are still in paris  under many
difficulties in procuring a passage home  mr william lee is at
brussels  mr izard has been to holland  to obtain a passage from
thence  but unfortunately missed his opportunity and returned
disappointed 

  i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 17th  1780 

  sir 

it is necessary  that i should inform congress in what manner i have
been able to procure money to defray my expenses in my long journey 
through the greatest part of spain and france to this city 

on my arrival at ferrol  i was offered the loan of money by the french
consul     de tournelle  who  at the same time told me  there was a
gentleman at corunna     michael lagoanere  who had heretofore acted
as an american agent at that place  and who would be very happy to
supply me  on my arrival at corunna     lagoanere did me the honor of
a visit  and offered me every assistance in cash  otherwise telling me
at the same time  he had some money in his hands  which he supposed
belonged to the united states  being part of the proceeds of some
prizes heretofore made by captain cunningham  that this money 
however  had been attached in his hands by some spanish merchant  who
had commenced a lawsuit against captain cunningham  i accordingly
received three thousand dollars for myself and mr dana  and a letter
of credit on the house of cabarous at bayonne  for as much more as i
should have occasion for  on our arrival at bayonne  mr dana and i
received of that house fifty louis   ors  and a bill of exchange on
another house of the same name and family at bordeaux for the like
sums  our expenses having exceeded all our computations at corunna  as
our journey was necessarily much longer than we expected  on account
of the uncommon bad weather and bad roads  this bill was paid upon
sight  so that  upon the whole  we have received the amount of
seventeen thousand four hundred livres  all on account of    lagoanere
of corunna  of this sum  mr dana has received the amount of four
thousand nine hundred and seventyone livres and fifteen sols  and i
have received twelve thousand four hundred and twentyeight livres and
five sols  for which sums we desire to be respectively charged in the
treasury books of congress 

as this money is expended  if    lagoanere should draw upon us for it 
all the authority we have to draw upon his excellency the minister
here will not enable us to pay it  and if    lagoanere should be so
happy as to avoid the attachment and leave us to account with congress
for this money  the small sum we are empowered to receive from his
excellency will go a very little way in discharging our expenses  we
must therefore pray  that congress would forward us authority to draw
upon his excellency for the amount of our salaries annually  which 
without all doubt  will be paid 

i have the honor to be  with the highest respect     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                     to the marquis de lafayette 

                                           paris  february 18th  1780 

  my dear general 

you know extremely well the skill of our enemies in forging false
news  and their artifice in circulating it  not only through the
various parts of europe  but in the united states of america  to keep
up the spirits of their friends and depress those of their
adversaries  it is their annual custom in the winter to send abroad
large cargoes of these lies  and they meet with a success in making
them believed  that is really astonishing 

since my arrival here  i find they have been this winter at their old
game again  and have circulated reports here  in holland  and other
parts of europe  that they have made new contracts with other petty
princes in germany  by which  together with those made before  they
will be able to draw seven thousand fresh troops from that country to
serve in america  that by appeasing the troubles in ireland  they
shall be able to avail themselves even of the military associations
in that kingdom  by depending upon them for the defence of the
country  and to draw near ten thousand men from thence for the service
in america  that they have concluded a treaty with the court of
petersburg  by which russia is to furnish them with twelve ships of
the line and twenty thousand men  which they say is of the more
importance  on account of the intimate connexion between russia and
denmark  as the latter will be likely by this means to be drawn into
the war  with their numerous fleet of fortyfive ships of the line  the
greatest part of these tales are false  i know very well what is said
of russia is so contrary to all that i have seen and heard of the good
understanding between versailles and russia  that i have no doubt of
its falsehood  but as i am very lately arrived  and  consequently 
have not opportunity to examine these reports to the bottom  i beg the
favor of you to inform me  with all the exactness possible  how much
truth there is in them  if any at all 

you are very sensible that it is of the utmost importance  that
congress should have the exactest information of these things  and
that you and i cannot render a more useful service to our country at
present  than by collecting such intelligence with precision  and
transmitting it without delay  knowing the pleasure you take in
serving the united states in every way in your power  i thought i
could beg this favor of you with propriety  and that you would believe
me always your friend and servant 

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

 to    genet  first secretary for the department of foreign affairs 

                                           paris  february 18th  1780 

  dear sir 

whether it is  that the art of political lying is better understood in
england than in any other country  or whether it is more practised
there than elsewhere  or whether it is accidental that they have more
success in making their fictions gain credit in the world  i know not 
but it is certain  that every winter since the commencement of the
present war with america  and indeed for some years before  they sent
out large quantities of this manufacture over all europe  and
throughout all america  and what is astonishing is  that they should
still find numbers in every country ready to take them off their
hands 

since my arrival in this city  i find they have been this winter at
their old trade  and have spread reports here and in holland  and in
various other parts of europe  and no doubt they have found means to
propagate them in america too  tending to keep up the spirits of their
friends  and to sink those of their opponents  such as  that they have
made new contracts with several german princes  by which they are to
obtain seven thousand men to serve in america  that they have so
skilfully appeased the troubles in ireland  that they shall ever be
able to take advantage of the military associations there  by
depending upon them for the defence of the kingdom  while they draw
from thence ten thousand regular troops for the service in america 
that they have even concluded a treaty with russia  by which the
empress is to furnish them with twelve ships of the line and twenty
thousand men  as some say  and twenty ship of the line and twelve
thousand men as others relate  this they say is of the greater moment 
because of an intimate connexion  i know not of what nature it is 
between russia and denmark  by which the latter will be likely to be
drawn into the war against the house of bourbon and america  and
denmark  they say  has fortyfive ships of the line 

i know very well that the greatest part of these reports is false  and
particularly what is said of russia is so contrary to all those
reports  which i have heard for these twelve months past of the
harmony between versailles and petersburg  that i give no credit to it
at all  but i find that all these reports make impressions on some
minds  and among the rest some americans 

i therefore beg the favor of you to inform me of the exact truth in
all these matters  that i may take the earliest opportunity of
transmitting the intelligence to congress  where it is of importance
it should be known 

i was much mortified when i was at versailles the other day  that i
could not have the honor of paying my respects to you  but i was so
connected with other gentlemen  who were obliged to return to dinner 
that i could not  but i shall take the first opportunity i can get to
wait on you  and assure you that i am  with great respect     

                                                           john adams 

                                                  

                     de lafayette to john adams 

                                           paris  february 19th  1780 

  dear sir 

as i came but this morning from versailles  it was not in my power
sooner to answer the letter you have honored me with  and this duty i
now perform with the more pleasure  as it is of some importance to the
interests of america  since the first day  when i had the happiness of
making myself and of being considered in the world as an american  i
have always observed  that among the many ways of attacking our
liberties  and among the most ungenerous ones  misrepresentations have
ever been the first weapons on which the british nation has the most
depended 

i am glad it is in my power generally to assure you  that the many
reports propagated by them and alluded to in your letter are not
founded upon truth  new contracts with petty princes in germany have
not  i believe  taken place  and if any such merchandise were sent to
america  it would at most consist of a few recruits  the troubles in
ireland  if there is the least common sense among the first patriots
of that country  are not i hope at an end  and it seems they now begin
to raise our expectations  the russian troops  so much talked of in
their gazettes  i take to be mere recruits for those thirty thousand
russians  that mr rivington had three years ago ordered to embark for
america 

those intelligences  my dear sir  must be counteracted by letters to
our friends in america  but as the respect  which we owe to the free
citizens of the united states  makes it a point of duty never to
deceive them  and as the most candid frankness must ever distinguish
our side of the question from the course of tyranny and falsehood  i
intend paying tomorrow morning a visit to the minister of foreign
affairs  and from him get such minute intelligence as shall answer
your purpose 

with the most sincere regard  i have the honor to be     

                                                            lafayette 

        on my return from versailles  my dear sir  where i will settle
the affairs of arms that i have undertaken  i will impart to you a
project privately relating to me  that is not inconsistent with my
sentiments for our country  america 

                                                                      

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 19th  1780 

  sir 

enclosed are copies of former letters to congress  and i shall
continue to transmit copies  until i learn that some have arrived  for
which reason i must request the favor that his excellency the
president  or some committee  may be desired to acknowledge the
receipt of letters  so that i may know as soon as may be  what letters
have arrived  and which have been less fortunate 

the art of making and spreading false news to answer political
purposes is not peculiar to great britain  but yet she seems to
possess this art  and the talent of giving to her fictions the colors
of probability beyond other nations  at least  she seems to have more
success in making her impostures believed than any other  it is her
annual practice in the winter to fabricate and export large quantities
of this merchandise to all parts of europe and america  and she finds
more customers to take them off her hands than she ought  considering
how illicit the traffic is 

this winter her emissaries have been more assiduous than ever in
propagating reports  that they have entered into new engagements with
several other petty principalities in germany  by which they shall
hire seven thousand men  for the service of the next campaign in
america  that by compromising with ireland  they shall be able to take
advantage even of the military associations in that kingdom  and draw
from them a large number of regular troops for the service in america 
depending on the volunteer militia  or associators for the defence of
the country  that they have made a treaty with russia  whereby that
power has engaged to furnish them with twelve ships of the line and
twenty thousand troops  as some say  and twenty ships of the line and
twelve thousand troops  according to others  this alliance they say
too is of the more consequence  on account of some connexion between
russia and denmark  who  it is insinuated  will follow russia into the
war  and denmark they add has fortyfive ships of the line  not manned
it is true  but england they say can man them 

these tales one would think are so extravagant and absurd  that they
would not find a believer in the world  yet there are persons  who
believe them in all nations of europe  particularly in holland  and
there is no doubt the same song will be sung in america  and many will
listen to it  there is nothing further from the truth  they will find
the utmost difficulty to draw from germany troops enough to repair the
breaches in the german troops made in america the last year  the same
with regard to ireland  and as to what is said of russia  there is not
even a color of truth in it  but on the contrary  the same good
understanding continues between versailles and petersburg  which
subsisted last winter  spring  and summer  as to denmark  i have no
reason to think that she is disposed to assist great britain  but on
the contrary that she has armed to defend herself at sea against great
britain  but if it were otherwise  to what purpose would her ships of
the line be unmanned  when great britain cannot man the ships of the
line she already has 

france seems determined to pursue the naval war with vigor and
decision in the american seas     de guichen sailed the beginning of
january with seventeen or eighteen ships of the line  seven more are
now preparing at brest with all possible expedition  supposed to be
for america  those  if they all happily join the twelve ships left
there by the count   estaing  will make a fleet of six and thirty
ships of the line  and the court seems determined to maintain the
superiority in the american seas  this will give scope to our
privateers to weaken and distress the enemies of their country  while
they are enriching themselves 

there is no news of admiral rodney  from whence i conclude he is gone
to the west indies 

the english have derived such a flush of spirits from their late
successes  which are mostly however of the negative kind  that they
talk in a style very different from that of peace  there are two
reflections  which the english cannot bear  one is that of losing the
domination of the colonies as indispensable to the support of their
naval superiority over france and spain  or either of them  in
possession of a powerful fleet at the peace  their maxim is to make
themselves terrible at sea to all nations  and they are convinced that
if they make a peace leaving america independent  and france and spain
powerful at sea  they shall never again be terrible to any maritime
power  these reasons convince me  that great britain will hazard all
rather than make peace at present  thompson    britannia   which
expresses the feelings as well as the sentiments of every briton  is
so much to the present purpose  that i hope i shall be pardoned for
referring to it  even in a letter to congress 

i have the honor to be  with the highest esteem

                                           paris  february 19th  1780 

  sir 

i have received the letter  which your excellency did me the honor to
write me on the 15th of this month  and lest i should not have
explained sufficiently in my letter of the 12th the nature and extent
of my commissions  i have now the honor to enclose attested copies of
both  as well as of that to mr dana 

with regard to my instructions  i presume your excellency will not
judge it proper  that i should communicate them any further than to
assure you  as i do in the fullest manner  that they contain nothing
inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the treaty between his
majesty and the united states  or the most perfect friendship between
france and america  but  on the contrary  the clearest orders to
cultivate both  i have hitherto conducted according to your advice 
having never communicated to any person since my arrival in europe the
nature of my mission  excepting to your excellency and dr franklin  to
whom it was indeed communicated by a resolution of congress  and to
him in confidence  i shall continue to conceal  as far as may depend
upon me  my actual character  but i ought to observe to your
excellency  that my appointment was as notorious in america as that
of mr jay  or dr franklin  before my departure  so it is probably
already known to the court of london  although they have not regular
evidence of it  i mention this  lest some persons might charge me with
publishing what i certainly did not publish 

i thank your excellency for the assurances of his majesty   protection
and of your confidence  which it shall be my study and endeavor at all
times to deserve 

  i have the honor to be

                                      versailles  february 20th  1780 

  sir 

you have been afraid to trouble the count de vergennes  and you have
done me the honor of addressing yourself to me  in order to know what
you are to think of several rumors  which the english have endeavored
to spread  i am infinitely flattered by the mark of confidence  which
you have been pleased to give me  but i have thought myself obliged to
lay the letter before the minister  he has directed me to assure you 
that on every occasion he will be very happy that you should address
yourself directly to him  and that you will always find him ready to
satisfy your inquiries 

he has remarked  as well as yourself  the address which our enemies
use to circulate false reports  and to make europe believe that the
americans are making advances to them  in order to treat of an
arrangement with them  the count de vergennes is likewise persuaded
of the contrary  as he is assured that no new treaty has been
negotiated with the princes of germany  and that no levies are making
there  but for the sake of filling up the old ones  he does not think
that the news of the treaty with russia  nor that which relates to the
court of denmark  are better founded  he told me that i might do
myself the honor to write you  that all those rumors are false  and
that you run no risk in presenting them as such to the persons  on
whom you think they have made some impression  both in europe and
america 

i am extremely anxious to have the honor to see you  and congratulate
you on your happy return  as i but seldom go to paris  i wish your
business may permit you to do me the honor to call at my house and
accept of a family dinner 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                                genet 

                                                   

                     to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 20th  1780 

  sir 

since my arrival in europe  i have had the mortification to see in the
public papers a series of little successes  which our enemies have had
in the prosecution of the war  the first was a very exaggerated
account in the english court gazette  of their successes against the
spaniards in south america  the next was the history of the repulse of
general lincoln and the count   estaing at savannah  and the raising
of the siege at that post  these were soon followed by the capture of
the spanish fleet of transport ships by rodney   squadron  and the
advantage gained by that admiral over the spanish ships of war  after
a most gallant resistance  however  off gibraltar 

these small triumphs  although chiefly of the defensive and negative
kind  and a poor compensation for the blood and the millions they are
annually wasting  are  however  sufficient to cheer the spirits of the
british populace  and to banish from the minds of the ministry all
thoughts of peace upon reasonable terms  for the english in the
present war act upon a maxim diametrically opposite to that of the
romans  and never think of peace upon any event fortunate to them  but
are anxious for it under every great adversity 

a report of my appointment having also been carried to england by the
cartels from boston  and being spread in europe by various other ways 
by passengers in the committee  by french passengers in the sensible 
of whom there were a great number who had heard of it in all companies
in america  and by many private letters  and the english ministerial
writers having made use of this as evidence of a drooping spirit in
america in order to favor their loan of money  i thought it my best
policy to communicate my appointment and powers to the french court 
and ask their advice  as our good allies  how to proceed in the
present emergency  i accordingly wrote to his excellency  the count de
vergennes  the letter of the 12th of february  a copy of which is
enclosed  and received his answer of the 15th  a copy of which is
enclosed  to which i replied in a letter of the 19th  a copy of which
is also enclosed  when i shall receive his excellency   answer  i
shall do myself the honor to enclose that 

if there is anything in these letters of mine  which is not
conformable to the views and sentiments of congress  i wish to be
instructed in it  or if congress should not concur with his excellency
the count  i shall obey their orders with the utmost punctuality and
alacrity  i have ever understood  that congress were first advised to
the measure of appointing a minister to negotiate peace  by the french
minister then at philadelphia  in the name of the count de vergennes 
however this may have been  it cannot be improper to have some one in
europe empowered to think and treat of peace  which some time or other
must come 

since my last  which was of yesterday   date  i have had opportunity
to make more particular inquiries concerning the pretended treaty with
russia  and am informed  that the english ministry did  not long
since  make a formal application by their ambassador to the empress of
russia for a body of troops and a number of ships  but that the
application was opposed with great spirit and ability in the russian
council  particularly by the minister for foreign affairs  and
rejected in council with great unanimity  and that the harmony between
versailles and petersburg remains as perfect as when i left france 

i have the honor to be  with very great respect

  dear sir 

i most sincerely congratulate you on your happy arrival in europe 
which must be the more agreeable to you  for the terrible voyages you
have had  every good american in europe  i believe  suffered a great
anxiety from the length of time that passed between the day when it
was known  that the confederacy sailed  and the time when the news
arrived of your being in cadiz  i  too  have had my hairbreadth
escapes  and  after my arrival  a very tedious journey in the worst
season of the year by land  happy  however  shall we be  if all our
hazards and fatigues should contribute to lay the foundation of a free
and prosperous people 

i hope no accident or disagreeable circumstance has happened to your
family  to whom i shall be obliged to you to present my respects  from
what i saw and heard in spain  from the strong assurances i received
of the good will of the court and nation  and from the great attention
and respect  that were paid me by officers of government of the
highest rank in the provinces through which i passed  i am persuaded
you will meet with the most distinguished reception  and i hope will
soon have the honor and satisfaction of concluding a treaty with
spain  you will have the advantage of more frequent and speedy
intelligence from home  than we can have here  at least you will have
it in your power  there are vessels oftener arriving from america at
bilboa and cadiz  i think  than in france  many of these vessels come
from boston and newburyport  perhaps the most of them  so that by
directing your correspondents to send their letters that way  you will
have them much sooner than we can commonly obtain them  and by
transmitting yours to messrs gardoqui   co  at bilboa  and mr
montgomery  or some other  at cadiz  your despatches will go more
speedily  and more safely than ours  for we find it almost impossible
to get a letter across the bay of biscay from france in a merchant
vessel  there are so many privateers in the route  the danger of whom
is avoided chiefly by vessels from bilboa keeping near the coast  and
running into harbor in case of danger  and wholly by those from cadiz 
you will excuse my mentioning to you this channel of intelligence 
which might not possibly have occurred to you  and my wishing to make
some advantage of it to myself  by asking the favor of your
correspondence  and that you will impart to me the advices you may
receive through it 

we have nothing new here at present  but what you have had before 
pray what think you of peace  it seems to be the will of heaven  that
the english should have success enough to lead them on to final
destruction  they are quite intoxicated with their late advantages 
although a poor compensation for what they cost 

my respects to mr carmichael  and believe me to be  with respect and
esteem  sir  your most obedient humble servant

  sir 

having been informed this morning by the marquis de lafayette  of
another opportunity for america  i have the honor to enclose to
congress triplicates of former letters  and copies of some other
letters  which i have written and received lately  i have also packed
up all the newspapers and pamphlets i can obtain  the  mercure de
france  is a weekly publication of very ancient origin  and is become
lately very interesting to america  because those political
intelligences and speculations  which were formerly published in
another pamphlet  under the title of  affaires de   angleterre et de
  amérique  are now published in this  the other having been dropped 
the  courrier de   europe  has the most extensive circulation of any
gazette  although supposed to be rather too much under the influence
of the british ministry sometimes  the  gazette de france  is
published by authority here  and has a great reputation for integrity 
in the  gazette de la hague  the english find means to publish many
false reports  these papers and pamphlets  together with one or two
english papers  for which i shall subscribe as soon as possible  i
shall do myself the honor to transmit to congress constantly as they
come out  from these  congress will be able to collect from time to
time all the public news of europe 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect     

                                                           john adams

  dear sir 

you will see by the public papers  that your committee of
correspondence is making greater progress in the world  and doing
greater things in the political world  than the electrical rod ever
did in the physical  ireland and england have adopted it  but mean
plagiaries as they are  they do not acknowledge who was the inventor
of it  mr lee and mr izard will go with this letter in the alliance 
and probably go to boston  they will be able to inform you of
everything of a public nature much better than i can do  as i have
scarcely had opportunity to look about me as yet  they will give you
few hopes of peace  at least very speedily 

the associations of counties and committees of correspondence in
england  are very ominous to our old acquaintances the refugees  as
they attack unmerited pensions in the first place  but they must do
greater things than distressing these gentry  they must necessarily
produce great commotions in the nation  the speeches at these meetings
go great lengths  some of them openly justifying and applauding the
americans  and others even applauding france and spain for stepping in
to our assistance  the court here seems determined more than ever to
pursue the war with vigor  especially by sea  and above all in the
american seas  they have already sent seventeen ships of the line
under    de guichen  to reinforce    de la motte piquet  and seven
others are preparing at brest  they are sending out clothing and arms
for fifteen thousand men for our army  and seem confident  that the
next campaign will be better than the last  i hope the spirit of
privateering among us will increase  because i think this is the way
in which we can do the most service to the common cause  i hope you
will be so good as to inform me of what passes  particularly what
progress the convention makes in the constitution  56  i assure you it
is more comfortable making constitutions in the dead of winter at
cambridge or boston  than sailing in a leaky ship  or climbing on
foot  or upon mules  over the mountains of galicia  and the pyrenees 

  believe me your friend and servant 
                                                           john adams

  dear sir 

the french court seems to be now every day more and more convinced of
the good policy  and indeed the necessity of prosecuting the war with
vigor in the american seas  they have been  and are making great
preparations accordingly  and are determined to maintain a clear
superiority 

   de la motte piquet has with him the hannibal  the magnifique  the
diadème  the dauphin royal  the artisane  the réfléchi  and the
vengeur  and if    de grace has joined him from the chesapeake bay 
the robuste  the fendant  and the sphinx  in all ten ships of the
line     de guichen has gone to join him with the couronne  eighty
guns  the triumphant  eighty  the palmier  the victoire  the destin 
the conquérant  the citoyen  the intrépide  the hercule  and the
souverain  all of seventyfour  the jason  the actionnaire  the caton 
the julien  the solitaire  the st michael  and the triton  all of
sixtyfour  the frigates  the medea  courageuse  gentille  and the
charmante  all of thirtytwo  he had above a hundred sail of vessels
under his convoy  and the regiment of touraine and enghien  of more
than thirteen hundred men each  and the second battalions of royal
corntois  and of walsh  of seven hundred men each  making in the whole
more than four thousand troops  besides these  there are seven more
preparing at brest to sail 

   gerard  mr jay  and mr carmichael are arrived at cadiz in a french
frigate  the confederacy having been dismasted  and driven to
martinique  the alliance carries this with mr lee and mr izard  who
will no doubt be treated with all respect at boston 

notwithstanding the commotions in england and ireland  the success of
provost at savannah  and of rodney off gibraltar  and even the silly
story of omoa  in south america  is enough to embolden the ministry to
go on with a debt of two hundred millions  already contracted  to
borrow twelve or fourteen millions a year  in the beginning of a war
with france and spain  each having a greater navy than they ever had 
each discovering a greater fighting spirit than they ever did before 
and obliging the english to purchase every advantage at a dear rate 
the premiums and bounties  that they are obliged to give to raise men 
both for the service by sea and land  and the interest of money they
borrow  are greater than were ever given in any former wars  even in
the last year of the last war  this cannot always last  nor indeed
long  yet i do not expect to see peace very soon 

pray write me as often as possible  and send the newspapers to me 

  your friend and servant

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you have done me the honor to write
me the 19th of this month  your full powers  of which you have been
pleased to send me a copy  are perfectly conformable to what    gerard
has written to me about them  and they leave us nothing to wish for 
as to the form or matter  i think there will be no inconveniency in
informing the public of the principal object of your mission  i mean
the future pacification  it will be announced in the gazette of
france  when it will mention your presentation to the king and royal
family  and you will be at liberty to give your eventual character a
greater publicity  by having it published in the dutch papers  i could
only wish  that you would be so kind as to communicate the article to
me before you transmit it  with regard to the full powers  which
authorise you to negotiate a treaty of commerce with the court of
london  i think it will be prudent not to communicate them to any body
whatever  and to take every necessary precaution  that the british
ministry may not have a premature knowledge of them  you will no doubt
easily feel the motives  which induce me to advise you to take this
precaution  and it would be needless to explain them 

with regard to your instructions  sir  i am satisfied that they have
for their certain and invariable basis  the treaties subsisting
between the king and the united states     gerard has assured the king
of it  in the most positive manner  and his majesty does more justice
to the uprightness of congress  and to the stability of the sentiments
which they have hitherto manifested  than to have ever entertained  or
to entertain  the least doubt on this subject  this way of thinking
will convince you  sir  that we have no need of seeing your
instructions  to appreciate properly the principles and dispositions
of congress towards great britain 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i had last evening the honor of your excellency   letter of
yesterday   date  and shall conform myself to your advice 

i shall esteem myself highly honored by a presentation to the king and
royal family  and shall wait your excellency   directions concerning
the time of it  and shall not think myself at liberty to make any
publication of my powers to treat of peace  until it shall have been
announced in the gazette  after which  i shall transmit to your
excellency any paragraph  which may be thought proper to publish in
the gazettes of holland  and take your advice upon it  before it is
sent  my other powers shall be concealed  according to your advice 
and i shall have the honor to pay my respects to your excellency very
soon at versailles 

  i have the honor to be

                                           paris  february 25th  1780 

  sir 

since my letter of the 20th  i have received another letter from his
excellency the count de vergennes  dated the 24th of february  which i
answered this day  copies of both letters are enclosed 

i have also the honor to enclose a gazette  and an application from mr
comyn  of marseilles  to be a consul for the ports of provence and
languedoc  i know nothing of this gentleman but what he says of
himself 

by the enclosed gazette  as well as by many others  congress will see
of what wonderful efficacy in pulling down tyranny a committee of
correspondence is likely to be  ireland has done great things by means
of it  england is attempting great things with it  after the example
of the americans  who invented it  and first taught its use  yet all
does not seem to produce the proper gratitude on the minds of the
english towards their benefactors  however  the glory of the invention
is as certainly ours  as that of electrical rods  hadley   quadrant 
or inoculation for the smallpox 

  i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 27th  1780 

  sir 

there are so many gentlemen of rank going out to america  that there
can be no doubt congress will be fully informed of the state of public
affairs 

mr lee  mr izard  the marquis de lafayette  mr wharton  and many
others  are going by different vessels  besides these  monsieur de
  etombe  who is appointed consul general of france for the northern
district of america  as    holker for the middle   i have not yet
learned who for the southern   will go soon 

there is an armament preparing with the greatest expedition at brest 
which is to be commanded by    de ternay  and to consist of eight or
ten ships of the line and frigates  six of the line and several
frigates  as it is said   perhaps it is not yet certain nor determined
exactly how many of either   with several thousand men  all numbers
are mentioned from six to ten thousand men  under the general officers
de rochambeau and jaucourt  whether this force is destined to the
continent or the west indies  time will discover  at present  it ought
not to be known  on the other hand  i see by a paragraph in a london
paper of the 16th of this month  that the thunderer  torbay  ramilies 
royal oak  triumph  and egmont  are ordered for the west indies  under
captain walsingham  the southampton  st albans  and winchelsea  which
were talked of to go with him  are found unfit for service  and in so
bad a condition as to be ordered to be paid off  thus the french are
likely to be drawn into the american seas in sufficient force  where
they have great advantages in carrying on the war  it is much to be
wished  that the spaniards could be drawn into the same field of
battle  for gibraltar must be taken in america if ever 

there are some persons  however  who think that the english will
avenge the french  the spaniards  and above all the americans  upon
one another  and it is certain that parties in england are working up
to a crisis  the petitions of the counties  their numerous committees
of correspondence  their hints of associations  have most certainly
alarmed the king and his ministers to so great a degree  that for some
time their conduct was equivocal  giving hopes at times to the people 
that the crown would favor the desired reformation in the expenditure
of money  but upon the news of rodney   successes they grew bolder 
and determined to exert all the authority of the crown to suppress the
meetings of the people  accordingly the cry of faction  sedition  and
rebellion  was set up in parliament by the majority  and the king was
advised to dismiss those lieutenants of counties  who had favored the
meetings of the people  advice which he has certainly taken  this is
a decisive measure  it will either discourage and suppress those
meetings  petitions  correspondence  and associations altogether  or
it will give them greater force 

by a debate in the house of commons on the 14th of this month  one
would think that the nation was nearly on the brink of a civil war 
yet  i confess  i cannot think that there are any characters at
present in whom the nation have sufficient confidence  to venture
themselves any lengths under their guidance  and i believe that this
spirited conduct of the king will defeat the measures of the counties 
unless  indeed  in the course of the next campaign  his arms 
especially by sea  should meet with any signal defeat  which would
perhaps reanimate the people  but supposing the people go on and
succeed so far as to effect a change in the ministry  the question is 
whether this would be an advantage to us or our allies  i am myself
very far from being convinced that it would 

there are none of the principal leaders of the people  who avow any
fixed principle  that we can depend upon  none that avow a design of
acknowledging our independence  or even of making peace 

by letters  which i have received from brussels and holland  since my
arrival  i am told that the late desperate step of the english in
seizing the dutch ships has made a great change in the minds of the
people there  and the government too in our favor  even the prince
declares he has been deceived by the english  and that he will promote
unlimited convoys  that an american minister is much wished for  who 
although he might not yet be publicly received  would be able to do as
much good as if he was  that money might be borrowed there by such a
minister directly sent by congress  applying directly to solid dutch
houses  i hope every hour to hear of mr laurens  arrival 

i have subscribed for the english papers  but have not yet received
any  which i am sorry for  because i can get none to enclose  as fast
as they come to me i will send them  i have the honor to enclose
another  mercure de france  

  i have the honor to be

  dear sir 

this will be delivered to you by the marquis  your friend  your
grandson is well and very contented  he has seen the world  to be
sure  such a part of it  that none of the rest can ever be
superlatively disagreeable to him hereafter  57 

instead of wishing and hoping for peace  my dear countrymen must
qualify themselves for war  and learn the value of liberty by the
dearness of its purchase  the foundations of lasting prosperity are
laid in great military talents and virtues  every sigh for peace 
until it can be obtained with honor  is unmanly  if our enemies can be
obstinate and desperate in a wicked and disgraceful cause  surely we
can be determined and persevering in the most just  the most
honorable  and the most glorious cause  that was ever undertaken by
men 

  i am  with great affection     

                                                           john adams

  sir 

i have this moment received a letter from    genet  who is one of the
first secretaries in the office of foreign affairs  and who has the
care of publishing all things relative to america  and has already
translated the constitutions of new york  new jersey  pennsylvania 
maryland  virginia  and south carolina  requesting me to assist him in
procuring those of georgia  north carolina  connecticut  rhode island 
massachusetts bay  and new hampshire 

there is so great a curiosity through all europe to see our new
constitutions  and those already published in the languages of europe
have done us so much honor  that i thought i should be excusable in
making a direct request to congress for their assistance in procuring
those  which    genet still desires 

those of rhode island and connecticut  being according to their
ancient charters     genet has already  those of massachusetts and new
hampshire  whenever they shall be formed and established  will be
easily obtained  but those of north carolina and georgia  i could not
obtain when i was at boston  and these are therefore the ones which   
genet wants at present  and which i have ventured to beg the aid of
congress to procure 

i have the honor to enclose the gazette of the day  in which congress
will see the news from england and holland

  sir 

the news of the day is  that rodney has gone with his whole fleet to
the west indies  that du chaffault is to command the french fleet in
america  and the count   estaing in the channel  that a large force is
to go to america  either to the islands or to the continent  both of
ships and troops in two divisions  that the last letters from holland
breathe a spirit somewhat warlike  and indeed the english have treated
them with so much indignity and contempt as well as injustice  that
one would think it was not always to be borne 

it is not agreeable to my principles  nor to my feelings  to injure
the character even of an enemy at war  but it is often possible to
draw important inferences from the true known character of a commander
of the forces of an enemy  it is therefore my duty to mention  that
rodney is reported to be a man of dissipation and prodigality  a great
spendthrift  and virulent against us  that he has often declared  that
if he had a command in america  his mode to humiliate and subdue us
should be  to burn every town and every house  that he could come at
upon the seacoast 

that such a plan of military execution will be sooner or later adopted
by the court of london  i have not the least doubt  from their known
principles  tempers  characters  and past conduct  provided it should
ever be in their power to attempt it in the whole or in part  and if
this is the disposition and system of their admiral rodney  the
appointment of him raises a presumption  that they have given him
express orders to this purpose at this time  an uncommon coincidence
of favorable circumstances has thrown the whole caracas fleet into his
hands  and given a victory  although pretty dearly paid for  over a
much inferior fleet of spanish men of war  if he is therefore a man of
such levity as is represented  and so malicious against us  and has
such malignant orders from his court  and goes to america flushed and
giddy with success  we may expect he will do mischief if he can  and
we ought to be upon our guard 

my business is peace  but i think of nothing but war  while our
enemies think of nothing else  we ought not to think more of peace
than to be ready to treat of it  as soon as it shall be put into the
hearts of our foes to be willing for it  americans must be soldiers 
they must war by sea and land  they have no other security 

i have the honor to enclose the gazette of the day  and to be with
much respect

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the  mercure de france  of this day  which
contains among other interesting intelligence admiral rodney  
narration  after his good fortune on the 8th of january last in
meeting the spanish caracas fleet  which sailed from st sebastian the
1st of january  under convoy of seven armed vessels belonging to the
caracas company  the guipuscoa  of sixtyfour guns  and five hundred
and fifty men  the san carlos  of thirtytwo guns  and two hundred men 
the san raphael  of thirty guns  and one hundred and fiftyfive men 
the santa theresa  of twentyeight guns  and one hundred and fifty
men  the corbetta san firmin  of sixteen guns  and sixty men  these
armed vessels were all taken  and the guipuscoa was christened prince
william  in honor of his royal highness  in whose presence she was
taken and given to one of the english captains  as a better ship than
his former one  the bienfaisant 

the merchant vessels under this convoy are the nostra senora de
  ores  the san francisco  the conception  the san nicholas  the
jeronimo  the divina providentia  the san gibilan  the san pactora 
the san lauren  the bellona  and the esperanza  all loaded with flour
and corn  the cervidada de merica  loaded with provisions for the
navy  the amisted  the san michael  loaded with anchors and cables 
and the bilboa  loaded with tobacco  those with provisions for the
navy  and that with tobacco  were sent to england under convoy of the
america and the pearl  and those with corn and flour were carried into
gibraltar 

this fleet seems to have been met at sea by the admiral by perfect
accident  of which the english do not appear to have had the least
hope  nor the spaniards the smallest fear  it must therefore be
allowed to be one instance of the good fortune of the english ministry
and their admiral  or rather as it is reported  of the king and his
admiral 

their good fortune  however  did not end here  for eight days
afterwards  on the 16th of january  they fell in with don juan de
langura  with eleven vessels of the line  who being so much inferior 
could not hope for a victory  he fought the english  however  upon the
retreat with so much bravery  skill  and success  that they were able
to take only three of his ships  the phoenix  of eighty guns  and the
princessa  and diligent  of seventyfour  were taken  and the san
domingo blown up  the    genero  the    justo  and the monarcha 
having separated before the battle  and the    juliano  the   
eugenio  the    augustine  and    lorenzo  having since arrived in
cadiz  although in a bad condition 

thus the english have been permitted  against probabilities and
appearances  to throw succor into gibraltar  and perhaps mahon  to
give a little fresh confidence to the ministry  and make a few
bonfires for the populace  but have added very little to their riches
or their power  in the meantime  rodney must have been retarded by
these lucky accidents  in his course to the west indies  and given
opportunity to the count de guichen to arrive before him in the west
indies  and prevent the reconquest of the grenadas  and perhaps do
more  but of this congress will be informed sooner than i 

these successes have not suppressed the independent spirit of ireland 
which is going on in a regular train  deliberating upon bills for the
independence of the judges  the habeas corpus  the restriction  of
subsidies  and discipline of their troops  and they seem determined to
throw off all the authority of the british parliament  nor that of the
committees of correspondence and petitioners in the counties of
england  which threaten associations  and  as the ministry themselves
say  sedition  faction  tumults  and rebellion  nor provided a fleet
for the british channel for the ensuing summer  nor assuaged the
serious resentment of holland  for the piracies committed in violation
of the faith of treaties  as well as the laws of nature and nations 
upon their commerce  as it is most interesting to us to know the
forces to be employed in america  by which word i comprehend the west
india islands  as well as the coasts of the continent  all these being
connected together in such a manner as to make but one whole  i beg
leave to lay before congress in one view  the french force that is
intended to be in that service 

there are actually at cape françois  the touant of eightyfour guns 
the robuste  and the fendant  of seventyfour  the sphinx of sixtyfour 
and the amphion of fifty  in all five  at martinique  the admirable 
the magnifique  the dauphin royal  and the diadème  of seventyfour 
the réfléchi  the vengeur  the artisane  of sixtyfour  and the fiers
of fifty  in all eight  making in the whole thirteen ships of the
line  reckoning as such two fiftys  if the count de guichen should
happily arrive  he has seventeen  which will amount to the number of
thirty  besides frigates  six others are preparing at brest with all
possible expedition  under the command of    de ternay  the duc de
burgone of eighty guns  the neptune of seventyfour     destouches  the
magnanime of seventyfour     de vaudreuil  the eveille of sixtyfour 
   de trobuiand  the jason of sixtyfour     de marigny  with this
fleet the troops are to be embarked  and there are many conjectures 
that it is intended for north america  the languedoc  the cæsar  the
provence  and the fantasque  of the fleet of the count   estaing  are
careened and refitted  and the royal louis of one hundred and ten
guns  the northumberland  and the astrea are to be launched
immediately 

in the course of my peregrinations  at brest    orient  and ferrol  i
have had an opportunity to see most of these ships  and to be on board
many of them  and one would think there was force enough to protect
us  and quiet our fears  but the battle is not always to the strong 
and we must wait patiently for time to decide events 

  i have the honor to be

                                               paris  march 4th  1780 

  dear sir 

this will be delivered to you by mr izard  who goes out in the
alliance with mr lee  mr wharton  mr brown  and others  he will wait
on you of course  and will be able to give you good information
concerning the intentions of the english  and their military
preparations by sea and land  and those of the french and spaniards 
at the same time  he will also give his opinion very freely concerning
american and other characters here  as well as measures 

in many things his opinions may be just  but in some and those not a
few  i am sure they are wrong  the great principle  in which i have
differed from him  is this  in the mode of treating with this court 
he has been always of opinion  that it was good policy and necessary
to hold a high language to this court  to represent to them the danger
of our being subdued  if they did not do this and the other thing for
us  in order to obtain money and other aids from them  he is confident
they would not have dared to refuse anything 

although no man in america  or in the world  was earlier convinced
than i was  that it was the interest of france and spain to support
the independence of america  and that they would support it  and that
no man is more sensible than i am of the necessity they are under to
support us  yet i am not  nor ever was  of opinion  that we could
with truth or with good policy assume the style of menace  and
threaten them with returning again to great britain  and joining
against france and spain  even telling them that we should be subdued 
because i never believed this myself  and the court here would not
have believed it from us  the court have many difficulties to manage 
as well as we  and it is delicate and hazardous to push things in this
country  things are not to be negotiated here as they are with the
people of america  even with the tories in america  or as with the
people of england  there is a frankness  however  that ought to be
used with the ministry  and a candor with which the truth may be and
has been communicated  but there is a harshness  that would not fail
to ruin  in my opinion  the fairest negotiation in this country 

we are anxious to hear from you  having nothing since the beginning of
december  and very little since we left you 

  your friend and servant

  sir 

yesterday i went to court  in company with the american minister
plenipotentiary  and had the honor to be presented to the king  by the
secretary of state for foreign affairs  after which  i had the honor
to go round with all the foreign ambassadors  and make a visit to the
queen  the king   brothers  sister  aunts  and daughters  which are
all the branches of the royal family  and to be presented to each of
them in turn  and after them to the count de maurepas 

after these ceremonies were over  we were all invited to dine with the
count de vergennes 

as ceremonies of this kind are so much attended to in this and all
other countries of europe  and have often such important effects  it
is proper that congress should have information of them 

i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                               paris  march 8th  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the gazettes of france  of the
hague  and amsterdam  of the 1st  3   and 4th of this month  they
contain all the news  which makes the subject of conversation at this
time  except that    du chaffault is to command in the west indies 
and the count   estaing in the channel  which  although it is not
announced by the court  seems to be very generally believed in the
world 

i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 10th  1780 

  sir 

enclosed are the  courrier de   europe   of the 3   and the  gazette
de france  of this day  the house of lords and the house of commons
are voting thanks to admiral rodney for his good fortune  for they all
seem to confess  that his brilliant successes were not owing to more
skill  valor  or vigilance than others have shown  but merely to his
good luck  which  by a report that spreads and gains credit today  did
not end with his advantage over langara  and his safe departure from
gibraltar  it is said that two french ships of the line and several
frigates with transports  bound to the isle of france  in the east
indies  have been doomed to fall in his way  and be taken 

whether this is true or not  he has done enough it seems to be in a
fair way of paying his creditors some part of their demands for money 
which he has gambled away  and which they had despaired of ever
receiving  this run of good luck  however  could never have happened
to the gambler  if the game had been played otherwise by the opposite
party  if france and spain  instead of keeping immense fleets in
europe with nothing to do  or employed in blocking up gibraltar  which
is a trifle  if taken in comparison of other objects in view  had but
employed but a fourth part of them in the american seas  where they
had  and still have  the enemies in their power  rodney   creditors
had still been in despair  together with the british government and
nation 

i would not desire a better proof  that the english are in the power
of their enemies in the american world  than the list of the prizes
printed in the  courrier de   europe   as condemned by    cushing 
judge of admiralty for the middle district of massachusetts bay  i am
very glad to see this method taken of publishing to the world the
success of our privateers  because it will in time show our allies
where our strength lies  and the weakness of our enemies 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 12th  1780 

  sir 

it is an observation made some years ago by a great writer of this
nation  de mably  that the project of being sole master of the sea 
and of commanding all the commerce  is not less chimerical nor less
ruinous  than that of universal monarchy on land  and it is to be
wished  for the happiness of europe  that the english may be convinced
of this truth  before they shall learn it by their own experience 
france has already repeated several times  that it was necessary to
establish an equilibrium  a balance of power at sea  and she has not
yet convinced anybody  because she is the dominant power  and because
they suspect her to desire the abasement of the english  only that she
may domineer the more surely on the continent  but if england abuses
her power  and would exercise a kind of tyranny over commerce 
presently all the states that have vessels and sailors  astonished
that they had not before believed france  will join themselves to her
in avenging her injuries 

the present conjuncture of affairs resembles so exactly the case here
put  that it seems to be a literal fulfilment of a prophecy 

a domination upon the sea is so much the more dangerous to other
maritime powers and commercial nations  as it is more difficult to
form alliances and combine forces at sea than at land  for which
reason it is essential  that the sovereign of every commercial state
should make his nation   flag respected in all the seas  and by all
the nations of the world  the english have ever acted upon this
principle  in supporting the honor of their own flag  but of late
years have grown less and less attentive to it  as it respects the
honor of other flags  not content with making their flag respectable 
they have grown more and more ambitious of making it terrible 
unwilling to do as they would be done by  and to treat other
commercial nations as they have insisted upon being treated by them 
they have grown continually more and more haughty  turbulent  and
insolent upon the seas  and are now never satisfied until they have
made all other nations see  that they despise them upon that element 
it is said by the baron de bielfield  that piracies and robberies at
sea are so odious  so atrocious  and so destructive to the interest of
all the european nations  that everything is permitted to repress
them  providence has not granted to any people an exclusive empire
upon the seas  to aim at setting up a master there  to prescribe laws
to other free nations  is an outrage to all europe 

i have quoted these authorities  because they contain the true
principle  upon which as i have ever conceived  the english began this
war  and upon which they will assuredly continue it  as long as they
can get men and money  which will be as long as they have success 
they contain also the true principles of france  spain  and holland 
and all the powers of europe  the outrages committed upon the dutch
commerce  and the insults offered to their flag  ought to be  and are 
alarming to all the maritime powers  the late successes of the english
will have no tendency to allay the fears of these powers  on the
contrary they will increase the alarm  by showing the precarious
situation they will all be in if england should finally succeed  which
some of them may perhaps apprehend from the late brilliant fortune of
admiral rodney 

one cannot but be struck with the rapid series of fortunate incidents
for the english  which have been published here in about the course of
three months  that i have been in europe  the little affair of omoa
began it  the repulse at savannah succeeded  with all its
consequences  the curraçoa fleet was next  langara   fleet soon
followed  gibraltar was relieved  don gaston   squadron was dispersed
by a storm  and admiral rodney had opportunity to get safe out of
gibraltar  the french east india fleet brings up the rear  there is
hardly in history such a series of events  that no human wisdom could
provide against or foresee  yet after all  the advantages gained are
by no means decisive  although no doubt it will raise the ambition of
the english  and in some degree damp the ardor of their enemies 

it must not have this effect however upon america  let the maritime
powers fare as they will  we must be free  and i trust in god we shall
be so  whatever be their fate  the events of war are uncertain at sea 
more than even by land  but america has resources for the final
defence of her liberty  which britain will never be able to exhaust 
though she should exhaust france and spain  and it may not impossibly
be our hard fate  but it will be our unfading glory finally to turn
the scale of the war  to humble the pride  which is so terrible to the
commercial nations of europe  and to produce a balance of power on the
seas  to this end americans must be soldiers and seamen 

it is proper  however  to keep constantly in sight  the power against
which we have to contend  the english have in all the ports of
england  in a condition for actual service  or at least given out and
reported to be so  twenty ships of the line  in the course of the
spring and the month of june  eight others which are now repairing 
and three new ones in the course of the year  the whole squadron for
the channel will be thirtyone  the squadron of arbuthnot  at new york 
consists of five  that of jarvis at the western islands is two 
including the dublin  which was detached from admiral rodney  and is
now in bad condition at lisbon  one only at jamaica  for the lion is
too far ruined to be counted  the fleet at the other islands  joined
by the hector  detached from rodney  the triumph and the intrepid 
lately sailed from england  are nineteen  seven of which at least are
in too bad a condition for actual service  that of india  including
two which serve for convoys  consists of ten  two of which however are
returning to be repaired or condemned  the lenox is a guard ship in
ireland 

rodney entered gibraltar with four spanish ships of the line  the
phoenix of eighty guns  the monarca  the princessa  and the diligente
of seventy  besides the guipuscoa  now the prince william  of
sixtyfive  which he took with the convoy on the 8th of january  he
entered  also  with the shrewsbury of seventyfour  which joined him
from lisbon  his squadron must therefore have consisted of twentyfour
ships of the line  if he left the panther and another at gibraltar  he
must have gone out with twentytwo 

whether he has gone with the whole fleet to the west indies  or
whether with part of it  and what part  is yet undetermined by the
public 

france and spain  however  have a vast superiority still remaining 
which  if it should be ably managed  will easily humble the english 
but if it should be unwisely managed  or continue to be as unfortunate
as it has been from the moment of the count   estaing   sailing from
toulon  it will even in this case last long enough to consume and
exhaust their enemies

march  the hague gazette of the 6th  and 8th  the amsterdam gazette of

  dear sir 

i have to acknowledge the receipt of three excellent letters  one of
the 1st  the others of the 5th and 8th of march  i thank you for the
copy of your letter to the pensioner  and for your dialogue between
york and chatham 

it is undoubtedly the duty of every commercial nation  to make their
flag respected in all the seas  and by all the nations  not by
insulting and injuring all others  like great britain  but by doing
justice to all others  and by insisting upon justice from them  but
how is holland to obtain justice from the english  who take a manifest
pleasure and pride in showing her and all europe  that they despise
her  holland seems to be as corrupted and unprincipled as great
britain  but there is one great difference between them  great britain
has a terrible naval force  holland has next to none  great britain
has courage and confidence in her power  holland has none  i do not
mean that the dutch are destitute of personal courage  but national
courage is a very different thing 

the curious doctrine of a constitutional impossibility of
acknowledging our independence is well exposed in your dialogue  i
suppose the idea was taken from lord chatham   dying speech  when he
conjured up the ghost of the princess sophia of hanover  to whose
posterity  being protestants  the act of settlement had consecrated
the succession of the crown and its authority over all parts of the
dominions  this was a masterly stroke of oratory  to be sure  and
shows  that my lord chatham in his last moments had not lost the
knowledge of the prejudices in the character of the english nation 
nor the arts of popularity  but a more manifest address to the
passions and prejudices of the populace  without the least attention
to the justice or policy of the principle  never fell from a popular
orator  ancient or modern  could my lord chatham contend  that the
heirs of the princess sophia of hanover  provided they should be
protestants  had the throne and its prerogatives entailed upon them 
to everlasting ages  over all parts of the british dominions  let them
do what they would  govern without parliament  by laws without law 
dismiss judges without fault  suspend laws  in short do everything
that the stewarts did  and ten times more  yet so long as they were
protestants  could there be no resistance to their will  and no
forfeiture of their right to govern  i said this was a figure of
rhetoric  employed by his lordship  ad captandum vulgus   i believe so
still  but i believe he meant it also  ad captandum regem   and that
he thought  by throwing out this idea  that he was not for
acknowledging our independence  the king  who at that time was
distressed for a minister able in conducting a war  would call him
into the ministry  i ever lamented this black spot in a very bright
character  i do not remember anything in his lordship   conduct  which
seemed to me so suspicious to have proceeded from a perverted heart as
this flight  allowance  however  ought to be made  perhaps he was
misunderstood  and would have explained himself fairly if he had
lived 

i have not seen the pamphlet entitled  facts   nor that by lloyd  nor
the  examen   i should be glad to see all of them  i find a difficulty
in getting pamphlets from england  but i shall have a channel to
obtain them by and by  i went to mr grant   as soon as i received
yours of the 8th  mr grant the father was out  and no other in the
house knew anything of your letter  or maps  or other things  i will
speak to the father the first opportunity  mr lee is gone to   orient 

what think you of luck  had any gambler ever so much as rodney  one of
our tories in boston  or half way whigs  told me once  god loves that
little island of old england  and the people that live upon it  i
suppose he would say now  god loves rodney  i do not draw the same
conclusion from the successes  that the island or the hero have had 
who can be persuaded to believe  that he loves so degenerate and
profligate a race  i think it more probable  that heaven has permitted
this series of good fortune to attend the wicked  that the righteous
americans may reflect in time  and place their confidence in their own
patience  fortitude  perseverance  political wisdom  and military
talents  under the protection and blessing of his providence 

there are those who believe  that if france and spain had not
interposed  america would have been crushed  there are in other parts
of europe  i am told  a greater number who believe  that if it had not
been for the interposition of france and spain  american independence
would have been acknowledged by great britain a year or two ago  i
believe neither the one nor the other  i know the deep roots of
american independence on one side of the water  and i know the deep
roots of the aversion to it on the other  if it was rational to
suppose  that the english should succeed in their design  and endeavor
to destroy the fleets and naval power of france and spain  which they
are determined to do if they can  what would be the consequence  there
are long lists of french and spanish ships of the line yet to be
destroyed  which would cost the english several campaigns and a long
roll of millions  and after this they may send sixty thousand men to
america  if they can get them  and what then  why  the glory of
baffling  exhausting  beating  and taking them  will finally be that
of the american yeomanry  whose numbers have increased every year
since this war began  as i learnt with certainty in my late visit
home  and will increase every year  in spite of all the art  malice 
skill  valor  and activity of the english and all their allies  i
hope  however  that the capricious goddess will bestow some of her
favors upon france and spain  and a very few of them would do the
work  if rodney   fortune should convince spain  that she is attacking
the bull by the horns  and france and spain  that the true system for
conducting this war  is by keeping just force enough in the channel to
protect their coasts and their trade  and by sending all the rest of
their ships into the american seas  it will be the best fortune for
the allies they ever had 

i long to learn mr jay   success at madrid  and mr laurens  arrival in
holland  where i will go to see him some time in the summer or autumn 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

by a letter from london of the 3  of this month  received since my
former of this day   date  i learn that the friends of the ministry
were in hopes every hour to hear that clinton  who embarked seven
thousand effective men   though they are said to be ten  in the latter
end of december  is in possession of charleston  the detachment
consisted of the light infantry and grenadiers of the seventh 
twentythird  thirtythird  fortysecond  sixtythird  and sixtyfourth
british regiments  a legion of horse  yagers  four battalions of
hessian grenadiers  the new york volunteers  ferguson   corps  one
hessian regiment  and a detachment of the seventyfirst british
regiment  many are of opinion that a part of this army was intended
for the windward islands  and that they embarked and sailed the 26th
of december  and was much hurt by a storm after sailing  two thousand 
under lord cornwallis  were said to be intended for the chesapeake  to
burn two or three men of war in james river  and to serve as a
division to the other five  going against charleston 

the friends of the administration are not in spirits about the picture
of affairs in america and the west indies  they fear the french will
have a superiority there  from whence some late accounts are arrived
of vast sickness and disorder on board the english ships  the naval
war will  to appearance  be removed for the next summer to that
quarter  rodney was to sail with four ships only to the west indies 
and walsingham will not take more than that number as a convoy to
about one hundred west indiamen  which were to sail about the 20th of
this month  and more ships of war would probably conduct this fleet
off the land  and it was probable in the new york and quebec trade
about fifty vessels more would sail about the same time  that there
was no talk of any troops or ships going to new york or quebec  that
there was a rumor that wallace would have a small squadron  and carry
four or five thousand men out  but this was not believed  that the
ministry had been hard pressed in several parliamentary questions
lately  that their party was losing ground daily  that the county
petitions for reformation were a heavy weight upon them  that it was
likely there would be serious disturbances  if reforms do not take
place  that the committees for each county have already appointed
three deputies to meet and act for the whole  which is the beginning
of a congress  and will probably be soon called by that name  that it
was hard to determine whether these movements at home  or the
proceedings in ireland  chagrin the ministry most  that the
sovereignty of england over ireland will not be of many month  
duration  that the armed associations in the latter amount to
sixtyfour thousand men  who seem determined to free themselves from
every restriction that has been laid on them  that their parliament is
about putting an end to all appeals to england  to render the judges
independent of the crown  they at present holding their offices
 durante bene placito   and not  quamdiu se bene gesserunt   as in
england  to have a habeas corpus act  to repeal poyning   law  which
enacts that all bills shall originate in the council and not in the
commons  to confine the new supplies to the appointment of new duties
only  to give bounties on their own manufactures  and to have a mutiny
bill  which last goes immediately to the grand point of jurisdiction 

that  however  notwithstanding all the present appearances against
great britain  and the certainty of america   succeeding to her wish 
there are not among even those  who are called patriots in parliament 
many who possess directly a wish for american independence  that lords
camden  effingham  coventry  and the bishop of st asaph are clearly
and distinctly for it  sir    saville  and but a few others in the
house of commons  that the rest of the patriots are for sovereignty 
america to give up the french alliance  make up a federal alliance
with england  by which no doubt they mean an alliance offensive and
defensive     

it is surely unnecessary for me to make any observations upon the
absurdity of these provisos  so injurious to the honor of our country 
and so destructive of her most essential rights and interests  by a
letter of the 7th  a vessel with two hundred hessians or yagers on
board has arrived at st ives  in cornwall  she sailed with the
expedition from new york  the 26th of december  and a few days after
received much damage in a storm  which it is thought separated and
dispersed the fleet  this gives us great spirits and sanguine hopes
for charleston  i have the honor to enclose several newspapers  and 
with much respect  to be

  sir 

i have taken some pains to inform myself what number of regular troops
the enemy have in the three kingdoms  because we may form some
judgment from this  whether they will be able to send any  and what
reinforcements to north america or the west indies  i am assured  that
they have not more than four thousand regular troops in ireland  and
these chiefly horse  it is not to be expected then  i think  that they
can spare any of these  there is too much danger even of popular
commotions in england  scotland  and ireland  to spare many of these 
if they were perfectly safe  or thought themselves so from french and
spanish invasions  i have  however  written to obtain more exact and
authentic information  which i will not fail to transmit as early as
possible 

i have received an account at length  both by the gazette
extraordinary  and by letter from london  that admiral digby is
returned with the fleet and spanish prizes from gibraltar  and brought
in with him the protée  a french sixtyfour gun ship  and three small
store ships  part of a fleet bound from   orient to the east indies 
the sixtyfour gun ship had about sixtythree thousand pounds in cash on
board  this fleet was unlucky enough to fall in with digby on the 23 
of february  rodney sailed from gibraltar on the 14th  and parted with
digby on the 18th  taking only four ships of the line with him to the
west indies  a like number will probably go under walsingham about the
20th or 25th of this month  with the fleet to the west indies  it is
said in letters from london  that by every appearance  there are no
more troops going to north america  and that it looks as if the
ministry mean not to continue the american war  but to let it dwindle
and die away  if this should be the case  it is to be hoped that the
americans and their allies will not let it dwindle  but put it to
death at a blow 

the marquis de lafayette  and his brother the viscount de noailles  a
young noble officer  who is worthy of his family  and of the relation
he bears to the marquis  who i hope will be the bearer of this letter 
will be able to say more upon this head  at present the king and his
general are the only persons  who ought to know the secret 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                           to james lovell 

                                              paris  march 16th  1780 

  dear sir 

i have received  since my arrival here  your favor of the 16th of
november  1779  i shall take proper notice of your remarks upon the
13th and 19th articles of the treaty  they are both of them of
importance  and  as to the last  i wish for an instruction upon it 
because there is no doubt to be made  that whenever a serious
negotiation shall be commenced  great pains will be taken for the
banished  although little attention is paid to them now  i learned
yesterday  that they have received no payment of their pensions these
eighteen months  the delay is colored with a pretence of waiting for
some funds for quebec  which have been stopped by the interruption of
that trade  they are still bitter  as i am told  and are firmly
persuaded  that america cannot hold out six months longer 

you assure me  that i shall not be without the orders and credit 
which i mentioned in a letter of mine  i thank you for this assurance 
which is conceived in such strong terms  that one would think you did
not expect any opposition to it  at least  an effectual opposition  i
wish there may not be  but i am not without conjectures  i will not
call them suspicions  upon this head  denying them  however  would be
virtually recalling me and mr dana  and in a manner the most
humiliating and disgraceful  indeed  i do not know how we should get
away from our creditors  you know what sort of minds cannot bear a
brother near the throne  and so fair  so just  so economical a method 
would not escape minds of so much penetration  as a refusal to lend
money without orders  i am not sure  however  that the measure would
be hazarded in the present circumstances  by persons by whom i have
been treated politely enough since my return 

i should be glad to know what the board of treasury have done with my
accounts  whether they have passed upon them  or whether there are any
objections to them  and what they are  i do not know but i was
indiscreet in sending all my original vouchers  because  if any of
them should be lost  i might be puzzled to explain some things 
however  i know by a letter from mr gerry  that they were received 
and i presume they will be preserved 

i wish to know your private opinion  whether congress will continue mr
dana and me here  at so much expense  with so little prospect of
having anything to do for a long time  an uncertain time  however  or 
whether they will revoke our powers  and recall us  or what they will
do with us  a situation so idle and inactive is not agreeable to my
genius  yet i can submit to it as well as any man  if it be thought
necessary for the public good  i will do all the service i can  by
transmitting intelligence  and in every other way 

you must have observed  that in all my public letters  and  indeed  in
a great measure in my private ones  i have cautiously avoided giving
accounts of the state of our affairs in france  i had many reasons for
this caution  in general  i was sure it would do no good  and i
doubted the propriety of stating facts  and remarking upon characters 
without giving notice of it to the persons concerned  and transmitting
the evidence  there is no end of conceiving jealousies  but  i am
sure  that officers of government  especially foreign ministers  ought
not to attack and accuse one another upon jealousies  nor without full
proof  nor then  without notifying the party to answer for himself 

thus much let me say  however  that the present plan of having a
distinct minister in spain  another in holland  and another to treat
with great britain  and having secretaries independent of ministers 
is a good one  i pray you to stand by it with the utmost firmness  if
it should be attacked or undermined  if you revoke the powers of a
separate minister to treat with the king of great britain  you ought
to revoke the former powers of treating with all the courts of europe 
which were given to the commissioners at passy  for  under these 
authority will be claimed of treating with the english  if my powers
are revoked  the powers of treating with all other courts ought to be
separated from the mission 

  your friend

                     to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 18th  1780 

  sir 

we have this moment the news of the arrival of the convoy from st
domingo  with sixty sail of merchant vessels  which is a great event
for this country 

it is also reported  that ten sail of spanish ships of the line  with
ten battalions of land forces have sailed  and their destination is
supposed to be north america 

the armament preparing at brest  is thus described in one of the
public papers  the count du chaffault de besné  lieutenant general of
the naval forces in france  has taken leave of the king  being
presented to his majesty by    de sartine  the report runs  that
orders have been sent on the 29th of february  for the officers who
are at paris to join their regiments upon the coasts by the 15th of
march  and that eight regiments are to embark under the count de
rochambeau  these regiments are that of  anhalt   whereof the marquis
de bergen is colonel in second   auvergne   colonel commandant  the
viscount de lavel   bourbonnois   colonel commandant  the marquis de
laval  and in second  the viscount de rochambeau   neustrie   colonel
commandant  the count de guibert  and in second  the viscount le
veneur   romergne   colonel commandant  the viscount de custine  and
in second  the marquis du ludec   royal corse   colonel commandant 
the marquis du luc  and in second  the count of pontevez   royal deux
ponts   colonel commandant  the count aux ponts   saintongé   colonel
commandant  the viscount de beranger  and in second  the marquis de
themines  it is asserted  that there will be added a detachment of
artillery  and that the baron de viomenil  the count de chastellux 
and the count de witgenstein will embark with these troops  and that
the duc de lazun will have the command of a body of twelve hundred
volunteers  and be joined to the armament under the count de
rochambeau  all these troops  as it is believed  will embark at brest 
and go out under the convoy of the count du chaffault de besné 

they add  that he will have more than thirtyseven ships of the line
under his command  destined for an expedition  whereof the genuine
object is yet unknown  many other regiments have also orders to march
down nearer to those upon the seacoast  and there are many vessels
taken upon freight for the service of the king  in the different ports
of the kingdom  the freight at havre is thirty livres a ton  on
condition that the owner furnish his vessel for twelve months  they
say the prince de condé will go and command upon the coast of brittany
with the count de vaux 

by a letter i just now received from holland  i am told that the grand
business is done between the northern powers on a footing very
convenient for holland  as it must compel the english to cease
interrupting the trade of the neutral powers  this would be more
beneficial to france and spain than to holland  by facilitating the
acquisition of ship timber  hemp  and all other things for the supply
of their arsenals of the marine  a principal branch of the british
policy has ever been  to prevent the growth of the navies of their
enemies  by intercepting their supplies 

what gives further countenance to this letter  and the reports to the
same purpose  which have been sometime circulated  is an article in
the  mercure de france   enclosed  they talk of an alliance between
sweden  denmark  russia  prussia  and the united province  for
maintaining the honor of the flags of these powers  congress will see
also another paragraph from london  which favors this idea  that the
baron de nolker  envoy extraordinary from sweden  had declared that if
the convoy of his nation was not released forthwith  with an
indemnification for expenses and losses  he had orders to quit the
court of london in twenty four hours 

some other paragraphs seem to show the dutch in earnest about
equipping a respectable naval force of fiftytwo vessels 

  i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 19th  1780 

  sir 

enclosed is a paper of the 10th of march  which was accidentally
omitted to be enclosed in the season of it 

there are two articles of intelligence  which ought not to escape our
observation  because they have relation to the armament equipping at
brest  although i do not suppose them of much consequence  the first
is of a small squadron of frigates  which is said to have sailed from
portsmouth on the 28th of february  in consequence of orders sent from
the admiralty on the 22   under the command of captain marshall  who
is on board the emerald  of thirtytwo guns  the others are the hussar
of thirtytwo  the surprise of twentyeight  the squirrel  and heart of
oak of twenty  the sloops  the beaver   prize of fourteen  the wolf 
and the wasp of eight  with the cutters  the nimble and the griffin 
it is thought  that this little squadron is gone to make a cruise on
the coast of france  to hinder the transports assembled in different
ports from going out  or even to destroy them  if that shall be found
to be possible  there is not  however  much to be dreaded from this
squadron so near the neighborhood of brest 

the other paragraph discovers the marks of more ingenuity and less
truth  it is taken from the english papers  that captain jarvis  in
the foudroyant of eighty guns  who has been out upon a cruise  with a
small division in the mouth of the channel  has returned to plymouth
and gone to court  to be himself the bearer to government of
despatches of great importance  from the court of france to congress 
found on board a sloop  which on her passage to philadelphia fell into
his hands  it is asserted  that these despatches contain an ample
detail of the operations concerted between the court of versailles and
dr franklin  among which the most probable is  the project of
attacking halifax  which is to be made by a body of troops from new
england  and by a detachment of french troops very considerable by sea
and land 

this moment a letter from london of the 10th of march informs me  that
a packet boat is arrived from jamaica  which sailed the 29th of
january  with accounts  that fort omoa is again in possession of
spain  that an english man of war has taken a spanish ship of war 
bound to south america with stores  she was pierced for sixtyfour  but
earned only fiftytwo guns  the jamaica fleet sailed on the 24th of
january  convoyed slightly  with two fiftys and two frigates  about
forty merchantmen in all  nothing yet from america  but it is
generally believed  that a storm has separated and dispersed
clinton   fleet  intended for the southern expedition 

  i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 20th  1780 

  sir 

i have at length received a parcel of english papers  which i have the
honor to enclose with this to congress  they are the general
advertiser  and the morning post  both of which i shall for the future
be able to transmit regularly every week  congress will see that these
papers are of opposite parties  one being manifestly devoted to the
court and the ministry  and the majority  the other to the opposition 
the committees  the associations  and petitions  between both i hope
congress will be informed of the true facts 

there is the appearance of a piquancy and keenness in the temper of
the opposite parties  by their writings and paragraphs in these
papers  that looks like the commencement of a serious quarrel 

by the violence of the manner in which such characters as keppel 
howe  burgoyne  richmond  shelburne  rockingham      are treated  it
should seem  that the ministry were exasperated to a greater degree of
rancor than ever  and that they were thoroughly alarmed and determined
to throw the last die  time and the events of war will decide what
will be the consequences of these heated passions 

by a conversation this morning with the viscount de noailles  i am led
to fear  that the fleet from brest will not be able to put to sea
before the 10th of april  this will be about the time the marquis de
lafayette will arrive in america  he sailed from rochelle the 13th of
this month 

  i have the honor to be

                                              paris  march 21st  1780 

  sir 

in the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on the 24th of
february  your excellency proposed  that the principal object of my
mission should be inserted in the gazette of france  when it should
make mention of my presentation to the king and all the royal family 

in the answer to this letter  which i had the honor to write on the
25th of february  i informed your excellency  that i should not think
myself at liberty to make any publication of my powers to treat of
peace  until they should have been announced in the gazette  it was on
the 7th of march  that i had the honor to be presented to the king and
royal family  but no notice has been taken of it in the gazette of
france  whether the omission is accidental  or whether it is owing to
any alteration in your excellency   sentiments  i am not able to
determine 

your excellency will excuse the trouble i give you on this occasion 
as it arises wholly from a desire to be able at all times  to render
an account to my sovereign of the motives and reasons of my own
conduct 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                            to william lee 

                                              paris  march 21st  1780 

  dear sir 

i have just received your favor from brussels of the 17th of this
month  and i thank you for this instance of your attention to me 

considering the state of ireland  and the spirit that seems to be
rising in england  which has already attained such a height  as to
baffle the minister  and the east india company  and to carry many
votes in the house of commons  almost to a balance with him  and even
some against him  i should not be at all surprised  if terms  such as
you mention  should be offered to america  nor should i be surprised
if another rumor  which was propagated at the palais royal this day 
should prove true  that a great change is made or to be made in the
ministry  and that the lords shelburne and rockingham  burke      are
in  yet i have no proper accounts of either 

whatever may be my powers or instructions  or whether i have any or
not  i am very much obliged to you for your sentiments on such a
proposition as a truce for america  supposing it should be made  your
arguments are of great weight  and will undoubtedly be attended to by
every one  whoever he may be  who shall be called to give an opinion
upon such a great question  you will not expect me at present to give 
if it is proper for me even to form  any decided opinion upon it  yet
thus much i may venture to say  that having had so long an experience
of the policy of our enemies  i am persuaded  from the whole of it  if
they propose a truce  it will not be with an expectation or desire 
that america should accept it  but merely to try one experiment more
to deceive  divide  and seduce  in order to govern 

you observe  that the heads of some well intentioned  though visionary
americans  run much upon a truce  i have seen and heard enough to be
long since convinced  that the americans in europe are by no means an
adequate representation of those on the other side of the water  they
neither feel  nor reason like them in general  i should  therefore 
upon all occasions hear their arguments with attention  weigh them
with care  but be sure never to follow them  when i knew them to
differ from the body of their countrymen at home 

you say the dutch are disturbed  do you wonder at it  they have been
kicked by the english  as no reasonable man would kick a dog  they
have been whipped by them  as no sober postillion would whip a hackney
coach horse  can they submit to all this  upon any principle  which
would not oblige them to submit  if the english were to bombard
amsterdam  or cut away their dikes 

i wish i knew the name of the principal confident and director of the
prince  whom you mention 

i am very anxious to hear of the arrival of mr laurens  but suspect
you will learn it first  mr dana returns his respects to you 

i thank you  sir  for your offers of service  nothing can oblige me
more than to communicate to me any intelligence of the designs of our
enemies  in politics or war  and their real and pretended forces by
sea and land  pray what is the foundation of the story of a quintuple
alliance between holland  sweden  russia  prussia  and denmark 

i am  sir  with great esteem  your humble servant 

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                     to the president of congress 

                                               paris  march 23   1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the english papers of the 11th  13th  and
14th of march  the  courrier de   europe   and the hague  leyden  and
amsterdam gazettes  we are in hourly expectation of great news from
holland  ireland  england  spain  and above all from america  and the
west indies  i have not had a letter from america since i left it 
except one from my family of the 10th of december  and  indeed 
although several vessels have arrived  i can hear of no letters or
news 

by the english papers congress will perceive the violent fermentation
in england  which has arisen to such a height as to produce a congress
in fact  and it will soon be so in name  the proceedings in the house
of commons on the 14th  which were terminated by a resolution of the
committee of the whole house  to abolish the board of trade and
plantations  carried against the ministry after a very long and warm
debate  by a majority of eight voices  is not only the most
extraordinary vote  which has passed in the present reign  but it
tends to very extensive consequences 

i believe it is very true  that this board has been the true cause of
the quarrel of great britain against the colonies  and therefore may
be considered as an object of national resentment  but a resentment of
this kind alone would not probably have produced this effect 

whether it is the near approach of an election  that has intimidated
the members of the house of commons  or whether committees  petitions 
associations  and congress have alarmed them  or whether the nation
is convinced  that america is indeed lost forever  and consequently
the board of trade would be useless  i do not know  be this as it may 
the english nation  and even the irish and scotch nations  and all
parts of the world will draw this inference from it  that even in the
opinion of the house of commons america is lost  the free and virtuous
citizens of america  and even the slavish and vicious  if there are
any still remaining of this character  under the denomination of
tories  must be convinced by this vote  passed in the hey day of their
joy for the successes of admiral rodney   fleet  that the house of
commons despaired of ever regaining america  the nations subject to
the house of bourbon cannot fail to put the same interpretation upon
this transaction 

holland and all the northern powers  with the empress of russia at
their head  who are all greatly irritated against england for their
late violences against the innocent commerce of neutral powers  will
draw the same consequences  the politicians of great britain are too
enlightened in the history of nations  and the rise and progress of
causes and effects in the political world  not to see  that all these
bodies of people will  in consequence of this vote  consider the
colonies given up as lost by the house of commons  and they are too
well instructed  not to know the important consequences that follow 
from having such points as those thus settled among the nations  i
cannot  therefore  but consider this vote  and the other respecting
the secretary of state for the american department  which arose almost
to a balance  as a decided declaration of the sense of the nation  the
first consequence of it probably will be one further attempt  by
offering some specious terms  which they know we cannot in justice 
in honor  in conscience  accept  to deceive  seduce  and divide
america  throw all into confusion there  and by this means gaining an
opportunity to govern  there is nothing more astonishing than the
inconsistencies of the patriots in england  those  who are most
violent against the ministry  are not for making peace with france and
spain  but they would wish to allure america into a separate peace 
and persuade her to join them against the house of bourbon  one would
think it impossible  that one man of sense in the world could
seriously believe  that we could thus basely violate our truth  thus
unreasonably quarrel with our best friends  thus madly attach
ourselves to our belligerent enemies  but thus it is 

sir george saville threw out in the house  that he wished to carry
home to his constituents the news of an accommodation with america 
and mr david hartley has given notice of his intentions to make a
motion relative to us  but i confess i have no expectations  mr
hartley   motions and speeches have never made any great fortune in
the house  nor been much attended to  from whence i conclude  if the
present great leaders  even of opposition in the house  were seriously
disposed to do anything towards a pacification  which we could attend
to  they would not suffer mr hartley to have the honor of making the
motion 

the heads of many people run upon a truce with america  and mr
hartley   motion may tend this way  but a truce with america cannot be
made without a peace with france and spain  and would america accept
of such a truce  give great britain time to encroach and fortify upon
all our frontiers  to send enemies into the states  and sow the seeds
of discord  to rise out of her present exhausted condition  suffer
france and spain to relax  wait for alterations by the death of
princes  or the changes in the characters of princes  or ministers in
europe  i ask these questions  that congress may give me instructions 
if necessary  at present i do not believe my powers are sufficient to
agree to a truce  if it was proposed  nor do i believe it would be for
our interests or safety to agree to it  if i had  i do not mean 
however  to give any decided opinion upon such a great question  in
this hasty letter  i am open to conviction  and shall obey the
instructions of congress  with the most perfect respect 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

mr burke   bill not being as yet public  we are not yet informed of
the items of it  but as it already appears  that it strikes at the
department of secretary of state for america  and at the board of
trade  there seems to be little reason to doubt that it goes further 
and strikes at the american board of commissioners  at all the
american judges of admiralty  governors of provinces  secretaries  and
custom house officers of all denominations  at least  if this should
not be found to be a part of the bill  there are stronger reasons  if
possible  for abolishing this whole system of iniquity  together with
all the pensions granted to the refugees from america  than even for
taking away the board of trade  and from several late paragraphs in
the papers  and from mr fox   severe observations in the house of
commons upon governor hutchinson  calling him in substance the
 firebrand that lighted up all the fire between the two countries   it
seems pretty clear  that it is in contemplation to take away all these
salaries and pensions 

if such a measure should take place  exiled as these persons are from
the country  which gave them birth  but which they have most
ungratefully endeavored to enslave  they will become melancholy
monuments of divine vengeance against such unnatural and impious
behavior  nevertheless  as these persons are numerous  and have some
friends in england as well as in america  where they had once much
property  there is a probability  i think  that whenever or wherever
negotiations for peace may be commenced  they and their estates now
almost universally confiscated  will not be forgotten  but much pains
and art will be employed to stipulate for them in the treaty  both a
restoration of their property  and a right to return as citizens of
the states to which they formerly belonged  it is very possible 
however  that before the treaty shall be made  or even negotiations
commenced  these gentlemen will become so unpopular and odious  that
the people of england would be pleased with their sufferings and
punishment  but it is most probable  that the court will not abandon
them very easily 

i should  therefore  be very happy to have the explicit instructions
of congress upon this head  whether i am to agree  in any case
whatsoever  to an article which shall admit of their return  or the
restoration of their forfeited estates  there are sentiments of
humanity and forgiveness which plead on one side  there are reasons of
state and political motives  among which the danger of admitting such
mischievous persons as citizens  is not the least considerable  which
argue on the other 

i shall obey the instructions of congress with the utmost pleasure  or
if  for any reasons they choose to leave it at discretion  if i ever
should have the opportunity  i shall determine it without listening to
any passions of my own of compassion or resentment  according to my
best judgment of the public good  there is another point of very great
importance  which i am persuaded will be aimed at by the english
ministers  i am sure it will by the people of england  whenever times
of peace shall be talked of  for facilitating the return of commerce 
they will wish to have it stipulated by the treaty  that the subjects
of great britain shall have the rights of citizens in america  and the
citizens of the united states the rights of subjects in the british
dominions  some of the consequences of such an agreement to them and
to us are obvious and very important  but they are so numerous  that
it is difficult to determine whether so great a question should be
left to my determination  if  however  contrary to my inclinations  it
should fall to my lot to decide it without instructions  it shall be
decided according to my conscience  and the best lights i have 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

it has been observed in former letters  that there is scarcely an
example of such a series of fortunate incidents as that which happened
to rodney   fleet  and it may be proper to dilate a little upon some
of these incidents  to show that the enthusiastic applause  which is
given him by the court  the lords  the commons  and the city of
london  is no otherwise merited than by the boldness of his
enterprise  unless simple good fortune is merit 

it must be allowed  that it was a desperate plan in the minister to
order him out on the design to succor gibraltar  and it was a
desperate resolution in him to undertake it  because he had to expect
to meet with the whole spanish squadron at cadiz  and that it would
follow him  which was in fact the case 

don gaston sailed from brest the 13th of january in search of admiral
rodney  with twenty spanish ships of the line  with four french ships
of the line  the glorieux  the burgundy  the zodiac  and the scipio 
with the frigate  the nereis  under the chef   escadre  the chevalier
de bausset  if the four and twenty ships of the line had joined don
langara   squadron  there is scarce a possibility of doubt  after the
brave defence made by him  with such inferior force  that rodney  
fleet would have been totally ruined  and consequently gibraltar
reduced to extremities  but this was not to happen  the next day after
don gaston sailed from brest  he met with a terrible storm  which
separated his fleet  two of his spanish ships arrived at cadiz the
31st of january  the serious and the atlant  each of seventy guns  the
third of february there arrived twelve others  the rayo  commanded by
don gaston  and the st louis  both of eighty guns  the velasco  the st
francis de paule  the    isabella  the    joachim  the st peter  the
st damase  the arrogant  and the warrior  all of seventy  the mink of
fiftysix  and the frigates  the assumption and the emerald  with the
french division under the chevalier de bousset  excepting the scipio 
commanded by the baron de durfort  which did not arrive until the 17th
of february  after having cruised ten or twelve days off st vincent 
which had been appointed as the place of rendezvous and reunion  in
case of separation  the guardian angel  of seventy guns  which was
also separated from the squadron  did not arrive till several days
after don gaston at cadiz  having suffered very much  as well as all
the other vessels  in their masts and rigging  by the bad weather  and
especially by the violent gale of wind  which they met with on the 1st
of february  near the cape of st vincent  of the five remaining
spanish vessels  four went into ferrol  the st vincent ferries  of
eighty guns  commanded by don   acre  lieutenant general  the st
charles  of eighty  the vengeur  of seventy  and the septentrion  of
sixty  the fifth  named the st joseph  of seventy  by don orsorno 
chef   escadre  returned to brest dismasted  this separation and
dispersion of the fleet and of its principal officers exposed langara 
and made rodney   fortune  and the necessity these vessels were in of
reparation  gave liberty to the english fleet to put to sea from
gibraltar and regain the atlantic ocean  on the 13th of february  to
the number of twentytwo ships of the line  including those of rodney 
digby  and ross  and four of the vessels taken from the spaniards  and
three frigates  with twelve merchant ships under their convoy  leaving
at gibraltar  the edgar  of seventyfour  the panther  of sixty  which
has been there a long time  and the guipuscoa  of sixtyfour guns 
taken from the spaniards on the 8th of january  with twentyfour
merchant vessels under her convoy 

there has been much conversation for several days  concerning a
spanish armament preparing at cadiz  and letters from carthagena say 
that the regiment of infantry  called the flankers  regiment  which
has been in garrison in that city  has been completed by orders from
the court of naples  and on the 1st of march  the first battalion
marched for cadiz  and on the 4th of march  the second battalion  it
is said that this regiment is to embark with several others  which
from different garrisons have arrived at the same place for america 
in all parts of which  according to appearances  the english will have
enough to do to maintain their ground this ensuing campaign 

in ireland  on the 22  of february  an assembly of the gentlemen 
clergy  and freeholders of the city of dublin  resolved unanimously 
that the advantages obtained in commerce are neither complete nor
solidly established  that the sense of the nation is  that the irish
parliament alone  in concert with the sovereign  can give to the laws
already obtained of the prince their obligatory force  that what has
been done ought not to be considered as anything more than a great
beginning  and that the general hope was  that the end of the session
would be as advantageous to the political constitution of the country 
as the commencement of it had been favorable to commerce  that the
fathers of the country are particularly requested and instructed to
obtain a declaratory act  which may preserve forever the free and
independent state of ireland  and by introducing some necessary
modifications of poyning   law  to prevent in future all controversy
between the king and the parliament of ireland  concerning fundamental
laws 

these instructions were given by the sheriffs to the representatives
of dublin  who answered that they were convinced  that no foreign
legislative power whatsoever had any right  or ought to arrogate to
itself any authority over their nation  and without injuring the legal
and known authority  which his majesty has a right to exercise over
this kingdom in a manner conformable to the laws  they would neglect
nothing to obtain an act  which should take away every unjust
restriction  and which should tend to assure the constitutional
independence of the kingdom  this is said to be the general sense of
the whole kingdom  so that it may truly be said  that the british
empire is crumbling to pieces like a rope of sand  insomuch  that if
the war should continue  i shall not be at all surprised if even
scotland should become discontented with the union  and the disputes
between the ministry and the east india company should terminate in
the independence of asia  nay  it would be no miracle if the west
india islands should request the protection of france and spain  or
the united states  i will take the first opportunity to write upon the
subject of lord north   loan  which  together with the other ways and
means  amounts to the amazing sum of £20 674 000 sterling 

  i have the honor to be

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 26th  1780 

  sir 

on the 2  day of march the news of the royal consent to the bill 
which the british parliament has passed for granting to ireland a free
commerce with the american colonies  the west indies  and the coast of
africa  was celebrated in dublin by public rejoicings  the guns of
the lark were discharged  the garrison made a  feu de joie   the
castle and other public buildings were illuminated  as well as some
private houses  the government were probably encouraged to these
demonstrations of joy  by the motion  which was made the day before 
that is  the 1st of march  by mr dennis doly in the house of commons 
for an address of thanks to the king  to which both parties
unanimously consented  not excepting the principal patriots  such as
mr ogle  mr hussy burgh  and mr grattan 

the address contains an assurance of their attachment to the royal
person and government of the king  a profession of gratitude for his
majesty   uninterrupted attention to the interest of ireland  and for
the happy alteration  which the wisdom of his councils  and the
liberal sentiments of the british parliament have effected in the
situation of their affairs  they express a double satisfaction for the
benefits  which have been granted them  because they appear to them to
be an efficacious remedy for the poverty of that country  and because
they furnish an unquestionable proof of that fraternal affection 
which they think they have a right to expect from great britain  and
which they will constantly endeavor to cultivate and augment to the
most perfect degree of mutual confidence  they profess the sincerest
pleasure in finding that the ties  which have ever united the two
kingdoms  have been bound faster than ever  by the conduct of their
fellow subjects  and they assure his majesty  that on their part  they
will never fail to make the greatest efforts for the maintenance of
that close connexion between the two kingdoms  which they firmly
believe to be inseparable from their happiness and prosperity 

the next day the house of peers  even at the motion of the duke of
leinster  followed the example of the house of commons  their address
is in substance the same  with this addition  that the benefits
received afford a remedy proportioned to their distress  and that they
will discountenance with all their power all attempts  that deluded
men might make to excite ill founded apprehensions in the people  and
to turn their attention to the commerce  which has been granted them
in a manner so extensive 

to these additions  however  there was an opposition  and finally a
protest  signed by lord carrisford  the earls of charlemont and arran 
and the viscounts powerscourt and mountmorris  and by the proxies of
the earl moira  and the lords eyre and irnham 

the duke of leinster  however  has brought upon his reputation by this
motion suspicions all over europe  that he has been gained by the
king  which a little time and his future conduct will either dissipate
or confirm 

the next day parliament adjourned to the 11th of april  congress will
be able to put a just interpretation upon these addresses  by the
account i gave in my last  of the instructions of the city of dublin
to their representatives  and their answer  as well as by those of the
county of dublin  which remain to be communicated  on the 7th of
march  there was held at kilmainham  an assembly of the freeholders of
the county of dublin  when the following instructions to their
representatives were agreed on 

 we  your constituents  desiring to acknowledge as we ought  the
advantages our commerce will derive from the particular attention 
which his majesty has given it  from the integrity of our parliament 
the firmness of our countrymen  and the justice  which the english
nation begins to render us  we declare to you  that what follows is
the principal cause of our joy upon this occasion  it appears to us 
that the desire of monopolising commerce was the only motive  which
could make england imagine that she had a right to usurp a legitimate
authority over this kingdom  and from the moment when she renounced
this monopoly  she has taken away the principal obstacle  which
opposed our liberty  and consequently the british nation will not
continue to itself an arbitrary power  from which she can derive
nothing but reducing this kingdom to slavery  we desire to know 
moreover  whether the united efforts of the parliament and people of
ireland ought to confine themselves  so as to leave this island in a
state of dependence and submission to laws  to which the nation has
never consented  to laws dictated by a parliament  in which she has no
representatives  let it not be said  that this power attributed to the
english parliament is chimerical  we may see the proofs of it even in
the repeal of several of the acts and in this  that several persons
declare  however falsely  that this power is founded upon law  having
an equal right to political liberty and to commerce  but deprived of
both  and nevertheless content to be restored to the enjoyment of a
free commerce alone  will it not appear  that we absolutely give up
the former  this idea would be absurd  it is then our duty to declare
to the universe  that we are of right a free nation  not to be
subjected to any laws  but such as are made by the king and parliament
of ireland 

 desirous of nothing so much as to live always in good intelligence
with the british nation  on account of the union of the two crowns 
our instructions are  that you shall make the greatest efforts to
obtain an act  which shall establish forever the independence of the
legislative power of ireland  we wish  moreover  that you would
endeavor to qualify poyning   law  by taking away from the privy
council the legislative power  in accomplishing these important
objects  you will acquire honor to yourselves  and give satisfaction
to the nation 

 it is not to be doubted  that you will also fall upon some plan of
economy  by making savings  which are become necessary to increase the
revenue of the crown  and improve the commerce of the nation  

it seems now very plain  that the irish nation aspires to an
independence of great britain the most unlimited  and acknowledges no
other connexion with her but that of affection and a subjection to the
same king  the troops already raised by associations amount to between
sixty and seventy thousand men  which are to be forthwith augmented by
ten thousand more  who are to be formed of countrymen  each officer is
to furnish four  who will be clothed and paid out of the funds  that
each regiment will establish for this purpose  the principal objects
of these armed associations are said to be  a free and unlimited
commerce to all parts of the world  except only the east indies  the
repeal of poyning   law  passed under henry the seventh  and another
under george the first  which restrains the legislative authority of
the irish parliament  with an express clause  that the parliament of
ireland ought  and shall be forever and wholly exempt from all kind of
control and dependence of the british parliament  in all cases
whatsoever  that students shall no longer be obliged to go to the
temple in london  and other seminaries in england to study law  but 
in future  they shall study in the university of dublin  under proper
professors  and shall be admitted to the bar in ireland by the lord
chancellor and the other judges  after a proper examination  the
judges to be natives  except the chancellor  the bishops also to be
natives 

in the meantime  the slightest circumstances may blow up the flames of
war between the two kingdoms  which would have been done some weeks
ago  if the regular officers of the king   troops had not given way to
the dublin volunteers 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i think it my duty to lay before congress what may occur in holland 
relative to the present war  at least until the arrival of mr laurens 
whose presence is much desired there  many appearances make it
probable  that the grasping and vindictive temper of the english will
compel the republic into the war  if they do take a part  it is very
certain it will be against england  as plunder and revenge are the
present ruling passions of the english  it is probable  that a war
with holland is rather wished for than otherwise  because the ministry
and their principal supporters seem to have no idea  that it is
possible to make things worse  and all the plunder they can get will
be so much clear gain  the dutch are so much alarmed and aroused  that
it is very certain the prince finds it necessary to give out  that he
has been deceived by the english  that he has changed his sentiments 
and that he will promote with all his influence unlimited convoys  it
is certain  that they are fitting their men of war with a great deal
of activity  and it is confidently affirmed  that they have made a
treaty with russia and sweden  who are to make a common cause  the
states of the province of friesland have come to a resolution  that it
was certain byland was not the aggressor  but that fielding had not
hesitated to make use of force to visit the dutch ships under convoy 
to stop those that were loaded with hemp  and to insult the flag of
the republic  that this proceeding shows  that the complaisance
hitherto shown to england  in depriving the ships loaded with masts
and ship timber of the protection of the state  in leaving them to
sail alone and without convoy  has had no effects  and consequently
the states judge  that a similar condescension ought no longer to take
place  but  on the contrary  all merchandise whatsoever  which the
treaties do not expressly declare to be contraband  ought  without the
least difficulty  to be admitted under convoy  and enjoy the
protection of the state  and to this effect  his most serene highness
ought to be requested to give orders to the commanders of the men of
war  and of the squadron of the republic  to protect  as heretofore 
all merchandise 

this resolution was taken the 29th day of february  and laid before
the states general  who  after debating upon it  determined to require
the deputies of the other provinces to obtain  as soon as possible 
the decision of their provinces upon the same subject  these two
provinces  holland and friesland  have already decided for unlimited
convoys 

sir joseph yorke  on the 21st of march instant  laid before their high
mightinesses another memorial  insisting on the aid which he had
demanded before  upon condition  in case of refusal  that his master
would  after three months consider all treaties between the two
countries as null  and in which he contends  that the protection
afforded to captain jones  whom he calls a pirate  in the texel and in
amsterdam  was a violation of the treaties 

in order more clearly to comprehend the dispute between great britain
and the states general  it may not be amiss to observe  that by the
marine treaty between the two powers  concluded at the hague in 1667 
all the subjects and inhabitants of the united provinces may  with all
safety and freedom  sail and traffic in all the kingdoms  countries 
and estates  which are  or shall be in peace  amity  or neutrality
with the states general  without any hinderance or molestation from
the ships of war  gallies  frigates  barques  or other vessels
belonging to the king of great britain  or any of his subjects  upon
occasion or account of any war  which may hereafter happen between the
king of great britain and the above said kingdoms  countries  and
estates  or any of them  which are  or shall be  in peace  amity  or
neutrality with the states general  and this freedom of navigation and
commerce shall extend to all sorts of merchandise  excepting
contraband goods  that this term of contraband goods  is to be
understood to comprehend all sorts of fire arms  their appurtenances 
and all other utensils of war called in french    servans à   usage de
la guerre    and that under this head of contraband goods  these
following shall not be comprehended  corn  wheat  or other grain 
pulse  oils  wine  salt  or generally anything that belongs to the
nourishment or sustenance of life  but they shall remain free  as
likewise all other merchandise and commodities not comprehended in the
foregoing article  and the transportation of them shall be permitted
even into places at enmity with great britain  except such places are
besieged  blocked up  or invested  masts  yards  ship timber  and
hemp  the articles now in dispute  are not contraband by this treaty 
or by the law of nations  yet great britain  in the hours of her
insolence and madness  which are not yet at an end  makes no scruple
to seize  condemn  and confiscate them  she pretends  that as the
dutch refuse to her the aid she demands by treaty  she has a right to
seize upon masts  timber  and hemp  which are not prohibited by
treaty  not to enter into the inquiry  whether the present case is
such  as by the treaties obliges the dutch to furnish her aid  but
admitting for argument   sake it is so  yet the consequences will not
follow  it would only follow  that great britain was absolved from the
obligation of the treaty  not by any means that she is discharged from
the obligations of the law of nations

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write on the
21st instant  i remember very well to have said to you  that your
presentation should be inserted in the gazette of france  but  from
the information i have since obtained  it seems that the
presentations  whether of ambassadors or ministers plenipotentiary 
are not thus announced in our gazette  and it would have the
appearance of affectation to insert yours  as a substitute  i will
have it mentioned  if you wish  in the  mercure de france   and you
can take measures to have the notice repeated in the foreign gazettes 

  i have the honor to be

i have the honor of your excellency   letter of this day  in answer to
mine of the 21st of this month  until the receipt of it  i had taken
it for granted  that the presentation of every ambassador was
regularly inserted in the gazette of france  and until very lately 
several days since the date of my letter to your excellency of the
21st of this month  i had supposed  that the presentation of ministers
plenipotentiary was constantly inserted likewise 

the information your excellency has given me  that the presentation of
neither ambassadors nor ministers plenipotentiary have ever been
inserted  has perfectly satisfied me  and i doubt not will equally
satisfy my countrymen  who have heretofore been under the same
mistake with myself 

i approve very much of your excellency   proposition of inserting my
presentation in the mercury of france  and shall take measures to have
it repeated in the foreign gazettes 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress copies of certain letters 
which i have had the honor to write to the count de vergennes  and of
others  which i have received from him 

it seems that the presentations of the american commissioners and
ministers plenipotentiary have not been inserted in the gazette  which
occasioned some uneasiness in the minds of some of our countrymen  as
they thought it a neglect of us  and a distinction between our
sovereign and others  the enclosed letters will explain this matter 
and show  that no distinction has been made between the
representatives of the united states and those of other powers 

i ought to confess to congress  that the delicacy of the count de
vergennes about communicating my powers is not perfectly consonant to
my manner of thinking  and if i had followed my own judgment i should
have pursued a bolder plan by communicating  immediately after my
arrival  to lord george germain  my full powers to treat both of peace
and commerce  but i hope congress will approve of my communicating
first to this court my destination and asking their advice  and then
pursuing it  because i think no doubt can be made  that it is my duty
to conduct my negotiations at present in concert with our ally  as i
have hitherto done 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                     to the president of congress

  sir 

there is an anecdote  which causes a great speculation at present 
because it is supposed to show the tendency of things in ireland  and
what is to be expected by great britain  if the ministry should oppose
themselves to the wishes of the irish nation  on the 23  of february 
three bodies of volunteers  those of dublin  commanded by colonel john
allen  those of the liberties  commanded by sir edward newingham  and
another body  commanded by mr taylor  assembled at the exchange  from
whence they made a long march in a circuit of four miles  accompanied
with other volunteers on horseback  to the park  the avenues of which
were guarded by five other corps of volunteers 

there they went through the manoeuvres and firings  with as much
celerity and precision as any regular troops  they were there reviewed
by the duke of leinster  as general and commander in chief 
accompanied with four aids de camps  and they all rendered to this
nobleman military honors almost equal to those which are rendered to a
king 

returning from the review  the volunteers met in barrack street a
detachment of the royal troops marching to the castle  these required 
that the volunteers should turn out of the way  and endeavored to
break their ranks  but the volunteers  with their bayonets fixed and
charged  stood their ground and discovered such a resolution  that the
commanding officer of the king   troops ordered them to halt  and
desired to speak with the duke of leinster  they entered into a
conference  the regular troops pretended they had a right to the
pavements  as the troops of the king  the volunteers  thought they had
a right to keep it  as free citizens  voluntarily armed for the
defence of their country  and consequently superior to mere
mercenaries  they supported these arguments by preparations for
battle  the people declared themselves in favor of the volunteers  by
collecting together a sufficient quantity of stones  to overwhelm the
troops  who at last gave way  in order to avoid a scene of blood  the
next day the volunteers sent to the viceroy an excuse  but couched in
terms  which justified their conduct as necessary to maintain the
liberty  independence  and dignity of the nation  i have seen so much
of the spirit of the king   troops  in several contests between them
and the citizens of boston  as to know very well what all this means 
the volunteers must have great confidence in their own strength  and
the king   troops equal diffidence of theirs  before an altercation of
this kind could terminate in this manner 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                    

                       to arthur lee  at   orient 

                                              paris  march 31st  1780 

  dear sir 

i have received yours of the 26th  and that of the 15th of this month 
i enclose a copy of the letter you desire 

   garnier is gone into the country  and i have not seen him since i
arrived here  mr izard  however  has seen him  and will give you a
satisfactory account of what he says 

if i were to apply to the other gentleman  you know what would be the
consequence  it would fly very soon to  you know where  and i should
have only the credit of meddling unnecessarily with disputes  which i
have kept out of as much i could  and which it is certainly now the
public interest  and consequently my duty  to keep out of as much i
can  i had  therefore  rather be excused  the gentleman himself would
probably give you the same answer to a letter from you directly to
him  as he would give to me  unless i should use arts with him  which
would be unworthy of you  as well as of me  and which i cannot use
with anybody 

i shall have enough to do  to steer my little bark among the rocks and
shoals  i shall have perplexities enough of my own  which i cannot
avoid  and dangers too  these i shall meet with a steady mind  and
perhaps none of them will be greater than that  which i think my duty 
of avoiding things that do not belong to me 

scarcely ever any minister executed a commission for making a peace 
without ruining his own reputation  in a free government  no minister
that ever existed  had a more difficult and dangerous peace to make
than i have 

the gentleman you mention has hitherto been very still  but he has
been well received  by all that i have learnt 

  adieu 

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                                paris  april 3   1780 

  sir 

the prince of orange  stadtholder  is not only supposed to have
ambitious views of allying his family to that of great britain  but is
very much influenced by the duke of brunswick  who is a field marshal 
and commander in chief of the dutch land forces  who is also a brother
of prince ferdinand  the duke is not upon the best terms with his
family  because they think he is too much attached to the house of
austria  by this double attraction of england on one side  and their
old friends the house of austria on the other  it is not very
surprising that his most serene highness is drawn a little aside from
the line of the american cause  which is now so closely connected  and
likely to be more so  with the house of bourbon  hence it is said 
that the count de byland is to be honorably acquitted by the court
martial  and hence the embarrassments the dutch are under  in their
wishes to resent like men the unparalleled injuries  that have been
done them by the english  there is  however  so much spirit in the
united provinces  as to oblige the prince to put on the appearance of
resentment at the insults offered to his flag  and to oblige the
british minister to assume the tone of menace  in order to work upon
the fears of the people  whose property is so exposed as to make them
dread a war with any nation whatever 

congress will  however  be able to judge of what is doing in holland
by the following proceedings  a petition was presented to their high
mightinesses on the 25th of february  for the equipment of fiftytwo
ships of war  in the following terms 

 your high mightinesses having thought proper by your resolution of
the 17th of this month  which came to us the 22   to require us to
present to your high mightinesses  without influencing  however  in
anything the deliberations of the confederates  a petition for the sum
of two million six hundred and twenty thousand five hundred and
ninetyeight florins  to assist towards the one half of the necessary
expense for an extraordinary equipment of fiftytwo vessels of war and
frigates  which are to be put in a condition of service by the first
of may  as well as of other articles more fully particularised in the
report contained in the resolution of your high mightinesses  and in
the estimate enclosed with it  which we flatter ourselves were made
with all possible accuracy  while the funds necessary for the half of
the equipment abovementioned  will be found in the produce of certain
duties 

 we have been the more zealous not to delay giving satisfaction to the
requisition of your high mightinesses  as we consider the said plan 
as tending to accomplish what has been for so many years represented
and advised  as well by his serene highness as by us  in general
petitions addressed successively to your high mightinesses  as well as
to the confederates  that is to say  to put the republic in a more
respectable state of defence  by augmenting her marine and troops  an
object upon which it has been again insisted in the petition of the
current year  which employed such reasons and such urgent motives to
this purpose  that expressions now fail us for adding anything to what
has been already said  and persuaded  moreover  as we are  that the
circumstances and facts  such of them as have passed in a manner so
remarkable  render useless and superfluous all further reasonings  in
such sort  that all these details being already perfectly understood 
as well by your high mightinesses as by the confederates  we think we
may depend upon this knowledge  in expectation of the definitive
resolutions of your high mightinesses  equally salutary and unanimous 
and the effect of which will be to prevent and ward off the new
misfortunes  which may threaten the republic  assured  moreover  and
persuaded  that the serious intention of the confederates is to
accomplish the equipment proposed with all that depends upon it  and
that to this end  their high mightinesses will be pleased  not only to
give their consent to the petition of two millions six hundred and
twenty thousand five hundred and ninetyeight florins  formed by the
present  but also  what is more important  to furnish as soon as
possible their quota to the general treasury  by which means the
colleges of the admiralty  whose duty it is to attend to the
equipments  may be possessed of the means necessary to this operation
at convenient periods  which will be thought more indispensably
necessary  on casting an eye on the reasons more amply alleged in the
report of the colleges of the admiralty  and expressed in the
resolution of your high mightinesses  the 17th of february  to which
we refer  


                               memorial 

on the twentyfirst of march  1780  sir joseph yorke  the british
ambassador  presented a memorial to their high mightinesses  of the
following tenor 

      high and mighty lords 

      the king  my master  has always cultivated the friendship of
     your high mightinesses  and has always considered the alliance 
     which has so long subsisted between the two nations  as founded
     upon the wisest principles  and as essential to their mutual
     prosperity  the principal objects of this alliance  which stands
     upon the immovable basis of a common interest  are the safety and
     prosperity of the two states  the maintenance of the public
     tranquillity  and the preservation of that just balance so often
     disturbed by the ambitious policy of the house of bourbon  when
     the court of versailles  in direct violation of the public faith 
     and of the common rights of sovereigns  had broken the peace  by
     a league made with the rebel subjects of his majesty  avowed and
     declared formally by the marquis de noailles  when  by immense
     preparations  france manifested her designs of annihilating the
     maritime power of england  the king expected that your high
     mightinesses  too enlightened not to see  that the safety of the
     republic is closely connected with that of great britain  would
     have been zealous to come to his assistance  one of the first
     cares of his majesty was  to inform your high mightinesses of all
     the circumstances of this unjust war  and in the critical
     situation in which the king found himself he did not forget the
     interests of his ancient allies  but  on the contrary  has shown
     the most sincere desire to favor the commerce and the free
     navigation of the republic  as much as the safety of his people
     could permit  he even desisted a long time from demanding the
     succors stipulated by the treaties  fulfilling thus his own
     engagements  without insisting on the accomplishment of those of
     your high mightinesses  the demand was never made  until after
     the united forces of france and spain showed themselves ready to
     fall upon england  and there attempt a descent by the assistance
     of a formidable fleet  although frustrated in this enterprise 
     the enemies of the king meditate still the same project  and it
     is by the express order of his majesty  that the undersigned
     renews  at this time  in a manner the most formal  the demand of
     the succors stipulated by different treaties  and particularly by
     that of the year 1716 

      hitherto your high mightinesses have been silent upon an article
     so essential  at the same time  you have insisted on a forced
     construction of the treaty of commerce of the year 1674  against
     the abuse of which great britain has protested at all times  this
     interpretation cannot be reconciled to the clear and precise
     stipulations of the secret article of the treaty of peace of the
     same year  an article of a treaty of commerce cannot annul an
     article so essential of a treaty of peace  and both are expressly
     comprehended in the principal treaty of alliance of 1678  by
     which your high mightinesses are obliged to furnish to his
     majesty the succors  which he now demands  you are too just and
     too wise not to feel  that all the engagements between powers
     ought to be mutually and reciprocally observed  and although
     contracted in different periods  they oblige equally the
     contracting parties  this incontestible principle applies itself
     here with so much the more force  as the treaty of 1716 renews
     all the anterior engagements between the crown of england and
     the republic  and incorporates them  as it were  together 

      moreover  the subscriber had orders to declare to your high
     mightinesses  that he was ready to enter into conferences with
     you  to regulate in an amicable manner all which might be
     necessary to avoid misunderstandings  and prevent every
     disagreeable occurrence  by concerting measures equitable and
     advantageous for the respective subjects 

      this friendly offer was refused  in a manner as unexpected as it
     was extraordinary and unusual among friendly powers  and without
     taking notice of repeated representations  both public and
     secret  upon the subject of convoys  your high mightinesses have
     not only granted convoys for different kinds of naval stores  but
     you have moreover expressly resolved  that a certain number of
     vessels of war should be held ready to convoy in the sequel naval
     stores of every species  destined for the ports of france  and
     this at a time when the subjects of the republic enjoyed by the
     force of treaties  a freedom and an extent of commerce and of
     navigation far beyond that  which the law of nations allows to
     neutral powers  this resolution  and the orders given to admiral
     byland  to oppose himself by force to the visits of merchant
     ships  have given place to the incident  which the friendship of
     the king would have greatly desired to have prevented  but it is
     notorious  that this admiral  in consequence of his instructions 
     first fired upon the sloops bearing the english flag  which were
     sent to make the visit in the manner prescribed by the treaty of
     1674  it was then a manifest aggression  a direct violation of
     the same treaty  which your high mightinesses seem to look upon
     as the most sacred of all  his majesty has made beforehand
     repeated representations of the necessity and justice of this
     visit  practised in all similar circumstances  and fully
     authorised by this treaty  they were informed in london  that
     there were in the texel a great number of vessels loaded with
     naval stores  and particularly with masts and large ship timber 
     ready to set sail for france immediately after  or under  a dutch
     convoy  the event has but too fully proved the truth of these
     informations  since some of these vessels have been found even
     under this convoy  the greatest number have escaped  and have
     carried to france the most efficacious succors  of which she
     stood in the greatest necessity 

      at the same time your high mightinesses thus aided the enemy of
     the king  by favoring the transportation of these succors  you
     imposed a heavy penalty upon the subjects of the republic  to
     restrain them from carrying victuals to gibraltar  although this
     place was comprehended in the general warranty of all the british
     possessions in europe  and although at that time spain had vexed
     the commerce of the republic  in a manner the most outrageous and
     unexampled 

      it is not only on these occasions  that the conduct of your high
     mightinesses towards the king  and towards the enemy of his
     majesty  forms a most striking contrast in the eyes of all the
     impartial world  no one is ignorant of that  which passed in the
     too well known affair of paul jones  the asylum granted to this
     pirate was directly contrary to the treaty of breda  of 1667  and
     even to the proclamation of your high mightinesses of 1776 
     further  although your high mightinesses have kept  and still
     keep a silence the most absolute  with regard to the just demands
     of his majesty  you have been forward  at the simple request of
     the king   enemies  to assure them of an absolute and
     unconditional neutrality  without any exception of the ancient
     engagements of the republic  founded upon the most solemn
     treaties  nevertheless the king would still persuade himself 
     that all which has passed ought to be attributed less to the
     disposition of your high mightinesses  than to artifices of his
     enemies  who  after having excited discord among the members of
     the state  seek alternately by menaces and by promises to animate
     them against their natural ally  his majesty cannot believe  that
     your high mightinesses have taken the resolution to abandon a
     system  which the republic has pursued for more than a century 
     with so much success and so much glory 

      but if such was the resolution of your high mightinesses  if you
     were determined to forsake the alliance with great britain  in
     refusing to fulfil the engagements of it  there would arise from
     this resolution a new order of things  the king would perceive
     such an alteration with a sensible regret  but the consequences 
     which would follow from it  would be necessary and unavoidable 
     if by an act of your high mightinesses  the republic should cease
     to be the ally of great britain  the relations between the two
     nations will be totally changed  and they will no longer have any
     other ties or relation than those  which subsist between nations
     neutral and friendly  every treaty being reciprocal  if your high
     mightinesses will not fulfil your engagements  the consequence
     will be  that those of his majesty will cease to be obligatory 
     it is in pursuance of these incontestible principles  that his
     majesty has ordered the subscriber to declare to your high
     mightinesses  in a manner the most friendly  but at the same time
     the most serious  that  if contrary to his just expectations 
     your high mightinesses do not give him  within the term of three
     weeks  to be computed from the day of presentation of this
     memorial  a satisfactory answer  touching the succors demanded
     eight months ago  his majesty  considering this conduct as a
     departure from the alliance on the part of your high
     mightinesses  will no longer consider the united provinces in any
     other light than that of other neutral powers not privileged by
     treaties  and consequently will  without further delay  suspend
     conditionally  and until further orders  in regard to their
     subjects  all the particular stipulations of the treaties between
     the two nations  particularly those of the treaty of 1674  and
     will hold himself simply bound by the general principles of the
     law of nations  which ought to serve as rules between powers
     neutral and not privileged 

                                                        joseph yorke  

on the 24th of march  the states general made the following answer to
sir joseph yorke 

      that their high mightinesses had resolved to represent to his
     britannic majesty by the count de welderen  their envoy
     extraordinary  that having seen by the memorial of the
     ambassador  dated the 21st of march  that his majesty fixed a
     term of three weeks to have a satisfactory answer touching the
     succors demanded  their high mightinesses wished to satisfy  as
     soon as possible  the desires of his britannic majesty  by giving
     him a positive answer  but they foresaw  that the form of
     government inherent in the constitution of the republic would not
     permit them to complete their answer in the time specified  as
     the memorial of the ambassador  having become an object of the
     deliberations of the representative provinces  it was necessary
     to wait the resolution of the several states  the assemblies of
     which were now sitting  or about to sit  that their high
     mightinesses assured themselves  that his majesty  considering
     these reasons  would not persist rigorously in the time fixed  to
     the end  that their high mightinesses might have that of forming
     in a manner conformable to the constitution of the republic  in
     which their high mightinesses had not a right to make any
     alteration  an answer to the memorial of the ambassador  their
     high mightinesses promising to neglect nothing for accelerating 
     as much as possible  the deliberations upon the subject  and they
     pray the ambassador to support these representations  with his
     good offices  with the king  his master  

sir joseph yorke  after reading this answer  replied  that whatever
might be his desire to satisfy the inclinations of their high
mightinesses  the orders of the king  his master  would not permit him
upon this occasion  that  however  he doubted not  that they would be
equally satisfied by the representations with which their high
mightinesses had charged the count de welderen at the court of london 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress

  sir 

the fermentation in england has already distressed the administration
and overawed some of the members of the house of commons  but there is
room to suspect  that this is chiefly to be attributed to the approach
of an election  the petitions are very far from being universal  and
the congress of the sub committees is not yet numerous 

at a meeting of these from york  surry  middlesex  sussex  gloucester 
hertford  kent  huntington  dorset  bucks  chester  devon  and essex 
from the cities of london  westminster  gloucester  and the towns of
newcastle and nottingham  holden at the st albans tavern  and
afterwards by adjournment at the great room in king street  st james 
on the 11th  14th  15th  17th  18th  and 20th days of march  1780  the
reverend christopher wyvill in the chair  a memorial was agreed on 
containing reasons for a plan of association 

they affirm that there is a despotic system  and they date the
commencement of it nearly from the beginning of the present reign  and
they say that they have arrived at the crisis  which the wisest of the
political writers marked for the downfall of british liberty  when the
legislative body shall become as corrupt as the executive  they should
have said more corrupt  because that is undoubtedly the fact at
present  as well as the case stated by montesquieu 

they say  that by the unhappy war with america  begotten in the first
instance of this despotic system  and nursed with a view of giving
completion to it  the fatal influence of the crown has been armed with
more ample means for enslaving parliament  while the nation has
visibly sunk almost into beggary  never did any country experience so
sudden a reverse from prosperity to depression  they state the fall of
rents  the accumulation of taxes  and the stagnation of all credit 
they then run a long course of reasoning  to show the utility 
importance  and necessity  of the several things they recommended to
the people of england  which are all comprehended in a few
propositions 

1st  they recommend perseverance in the petitions  and an association
in support of them 

2dly  a new law for taking the suffrages of the people at elections 
to prevent expense and influence 

3dly  to adopt  as part of their general associations  the following
propositions 

i  that an examination be made into all the branches of the receipt 
expenditure  and mode of keeping and passing accounts of public money 

ii  one hundred  at least  of additional members of counties in the
house of commons 

iii  that the members of the house of commons be  annually elected  

iv  that it is recommended to all voters to support  at the next
election  such candidates as shall  by signing the association or
otherwise  satisfy them that they will support these regulations in
parliament 

in the middlesex committee  at the masons  tavern  march 24th  this
circular letter and the memorial it contained were unanimously
approved  and their members in the general congress thanked  in the
westminster committee  king   arms tavern  palace yard  march 15th 
1780  it was resolved   that by the resolution of the general meeting 
directing this committee to prepare a plan of association on legal and
constitutional grounds  to support the laudable reform  and such other
measures as may conduce to restore the freedom of parliament  this
committee conceive themselves bound to enter into the consideration of
every question tending to establish the independency of parliament on
a solid and durable basis  that the duration of parliament  and the
state of the representatives of the people  are questions immediately
under this description  that a sub committee  consisting of seven
persons  be appointed to inquire into the state of the representation
of the nation and make a report   on the 20th of march  the
sub committee reported  the report is dated the 19th   that new
parliaments to be holden once in every year were the ancient usage 
and declared to be the hereditary and indefeasible right of the people
of england  that the 6th of william and mary is the first  which
attempts to appoint the time of the continuance of parliament to be
for the term of three years  though the same act recognises the
ancient laws and statutes of this kingdom  by which annual parliaments
were confirmed  and declares that frequent and new parliaments tend
very much to the happy union and good agreement of the king and
people  that by the 1st of george the first  the parliament then
chosen for three years   by acquiescence of the people to the act of
william and mary  on the faith of its declaring  that from henceforth 
no parliament whatsoever  that shall at any time hereafter be called 
assembled  or held  shall have any continuance for longer than three
years only at the furthest   did pass an act to prolong its
continuance to seven years  that temporary considerations are stated
in the preamble to the act  as the principal motives for the act
itself  that the 6th of william and mary is worded as if declaratory
of what was conceived  however falsely  to have been the constitution
of the country  but that the septennial act assumes a power of
altering the duration of parliament at pleasure  that these
alterations in the constitution of parliament were made without
communication with the constituent body of the people  and have been
continued without the sanction of their approbation  that the
septennial bill was strongly opposed in parliament  and a direct
infringement on the constitution  and a flagrant breach of trust
towards the constituent body  that it was supported almost entirely on
the principle of expediency  that the voice of the people appeared
strongly against it  in many respectable petitions to parliament on
the occasion  and that a constitutional protest was entered by the
peers  stating  that frequent parliaments were the fundamental
constitution of the kingdom  that the house of commons ought to be
chosen by the people  and when continued for a longer time than they
were chosen for  they were then chosen by the parliament and not by
the people  that they conceived the bill  so far from preventing
corruption  would rather increase it  for the longer a parliament was
to last  the more valuable to corrupt ones would be the purchase  and
that all the reasons which had been given for long parliaments might
be given for making them perpetual  which would be an absolute
subversion of the third estate  that various motions were afterwards
made and strongly supported for a repeal of the septennial act 
particularly a motion for annual parliaments in 1774  which was lost
only by a majority of thirtytwo  that the city of london and other
respectable bodies continued to instruct their representatives to
prosecute this object in the most vigorous manner  as essentially
necessary to the independency and integrity of parliament  the rights
of the people  and the prosperity of their country  that by the 8th of
henry sixth  the parliament  then elected by the commonality at large 
passed an act to disfranchise the greater part of their constituents 
by limiting the right of election of knights of the shire to persons
having free lands  or tenants  to the value of forty shillings by the
year  at the least  which restriction has ever since continued  that
many towns and boroughs  formerly entitled for their repute and
reputation  to send members to parliament  have since fallen into
decay  yet continue to have a representation equal to the most opulent
counties and cities  while other towns and places  which have risen
into consideration  and become populous and wealthy  have no
representatives in parliament  that the number of the inhabitants of
england and wales is above five millions  that of these  twelve
hundred thousand are supposed capable of voting  as the constitution
stood before the restrictive act above quoted  that not more than two
hundred and fourteen thousand are at present permitted to vote  that
out of these  one hundred and thirty thousand freeholders elect
ninetytwo members for fiftytwo counties  fortythree thousand citizens 
freemen and others  elect fiftytwo members for twentythree cities and
two universities  and fortyone thousand electors choose three hundred
and sixtynine members for one hundred and ninetytwo towns and
boroughs  that fifty of these members are returned by three hundred
and forty electors  and a number scarcely above six thousand  being a
majority of the voters of one hundred and twentynine of the boroughs 
return two hundred and fiftyseven representatives  which is a majority
of the whole english house of commons  and the efficient
representation of above five millions of people  that many of these
boroughs are immediately under the influence of the crown  as the
cinque ports  many of them are private property  affording hereditary
seats  as those under burgage  tenure  and some of them almost without
houses or inhabitants  as galton  newtown  and old sarum  that
considering the representation with reference to property  many
counties return representatives out of all proportion to what they
contribute to the public revenue  that cornwall pays to land tax and
subsidy  sixteen parts out of five hundred and thirty  and sends
fortyfour members to parliament  while middlesex pays not less in
proportion than two hundred and fiftysix  and sends eight members  so
that the inequality of the representation of this country  with regard
to property  is still greater than when estimated according to the
numbers of its inhabitants   the westminster committee after
considering this report  mr fox in the chair  came to the following
resolutions 

 1  that annual parliaments are the undoubted right of the people of
england  and that the act which prolonged their duration was
subversive of the constitution  and a violation on the part of the
representatives  of the sacred trust reposed in them by their
constituents 

 2  that the present state of the representation of this country is
inadequate to the object  and a departure from the first principles of
the constitution 

 3  that thanks be given to the sub committee for their very
intelligent report 

 4  that copies of it be sent to the several committees of the
counties  cities  and boroughs of the kingdom  

i have been thus particular in stating the proceedings of these
committees  because it must be an advantage for congress to have them
all in view  and to see the whole of the foundation that is laid  they
are some of the most important proceedings of the present reign  they
are the commencement of a new sovereignty in opposition to the old  if
there is virtue or good sense in the nation  these machines will
discover it and set it in motion  and provided the war continues  it
will prevail  but if there is neither virtue or sense remaining  or
not enough of these to produce the desired effect  it will probably
be the last national effort made in favor of liberty  and despotism
will range at large 

if the king would make peace now  he would dissipate all these
combinations in england  ireland  and holland  as well as prevent the
treaty with spain   which i believe is in a good way  from a letter
which i lately saw from mr carmichael   from giving advantages  to
spain  and disadvantages to england  which can never be altered  but
if he continues the war long  if he should have signal successes 
these may dispel the storms in england and ireland  but if he should
be unsuccessful  the new sovereignty will probably prevail against
him  after involving the three kingdoms in confusion and blood 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

there is an anecdote from malaga  which ought to be mentioned to
congress  because  it cannot fail to have serious consequences 

the swedish frigate  the illerim  of thirtyfour guns  commanded by
captain ankerloo  on the 28th of february  at half after eight o clock
at night met an english privateer belonging to minorca  of twentyeight
guns  the swedish captain  after hailing the privateer  let her
continue her course  and went on quietly his own  about half an hour
after the privateer returning  ranged herself astern of the frigate 
and unexpectedly discharged both his broadsides  loaded with langrage 
which killed three sailors  broke the thigh and the right leg of the
captain  wounded the lieutenant and some people of the crew  ankerloo 
who in the evening had been obliged by a violent gale of wind to draw
in his guns and shut up his ports  not finding himself prepared for
battle  his officers took immediate measures  with the utmost
alertness  for repulsing the privateer  which did in fact at last
receive one broadside from the frigate  but  upon the whole  she
escaped in the night  by the force of sails and of oars  after this
perfidy on the part of the english  ankerloo would have entered
marseilles for the sake of dressing his wounds  but having met with
contrary winds and bad weather for three days  he put into malaga 
where he went ashore to the house of the swedish consul  where he is
since dead of his wounds 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                               paris  april 6th  1780 

  sir 

it may be necessary to transmit the decree of sir james mariott 
against the dutch ship la sybellina hillegonda  in order fully to
comprehend the proceedings  which i have sent before  the decree is
this 

 the fact in this case is  a dutch ship loaded with naval stores  for
a port in france  under the convoy of not less than five men of war 
and the commander of these men of war  not measuring his conduct by
the line of the treaty  resists  fires upon the boat of the english
commodore  and forbids the execution of the treaty  the english
commodore returns the fire  the dutch admiral fires again  and
strikes  so that the fact is to be adjusted  and it is of such a
nature as has never before happened in the history of this nation  it
falls unfortunately to my share  to decide upon these facts and their
consequences 

 it is  nevertheless  a consolation  that although the judge of this
court may decide  in the first instance  there is still a superior
tribunal  in the last resort  this court ought to judge of the case of
the treaty  since  in virtue of a special commission  under the great
seal of the kingdom  the judges of the courts of admiralty are
authorised and required to take cognizance of  and proceed judicially
in all manner of captures  seizures  prizes  and reprisals  and decide
upon them according to the course of the admiralty and the law of
nations 

 the claimant disdains to found his right in any other way than upon
the treaty  my idea is  that all the marine treaties  which subsist
between two friendly powers  form but one code of laws  one great
confederation  one indivisible union  they are  if it is lawful to
make use of these sacred words  the bible  the book  or the testament
of the social contract between the nations  to be maintained
inviolably  as a system  whereof we cannot break one part without
dissolving the whole 

 the dutch subjects have  in virtue of the treaty  particular
privileges  superior to those of every other country  but they may
overleap the bounds of these privileges  and from that time they ought
to be weighed in the balance  like other neutral nations  to be found
under a convoy is not  in itself  an infraction of the treaty  but the
conduct of this convoy is to be considered 

 the fifth article of the treaty of 1674 is reciprocal   if any ship 
belonging to the subjects of his majesty of great britain  shall in
open sea  or elsewhere  out of the dominions of the said states  meet
any ships of war of the lords the states  or privateers belonging to
their subjects  the said ships of the lords the states  or of their
subjects  shall keep at a convenient distance  and only send out their
boat  with two or three men only  to go on board such ships or vessels
of the subjects of his majesty  in order that the passport  or
sea brief  concerning the property thereof  according to the form
hereunder annexed  may be produced to them  by the captain or master
of such ship or vessel  belonging to the subjects of his majesty  and
the said ships  so producing the same  shall freely pass  and it shall
not be lawful to molest  search  detain  or force such ship from her
intended voyage  and the subjects of the lords the states shall enjoy
in all things  the same liberty and immunity  they in like manner
showing their passport  or sea brief  made out according to the form
prescribed at the foot of this treaty  

 the sixth article is   if any ship or vessel  belonging to the
english or other subjects of great britain  shall be met making into
any port belonging to an enemy of the lords the states  or  on the
other side  if any ship belonging to the united provinces of the
netherlands  or other subjects of the lords the states  shall be met
in her way  making into any port under the obedience of the enemies of
his said majesty  such ships shall show  not only a passport  or
sea brief  according to the form hereunder subscribed  wherewith she
is to be furnished  but also her certificate or cocket  containing the
particulars of the goods on board  in the usual form  by the officers
of the customs of that port  from whence she came  whereby it may be
known whether she is laden with any of the goods prohibited by the
third article of this treaty  

 such are the terms of this treaty  which this court will not declare
to be now in force  but one of the parties may renounce it  and it
would be from that time  so far forth  a good cause of annulling it 
it could not ever have been the intention of the contracting parties 
that the merchant ships of the subjects of the states should become
the transport vessels for the service of the king of france  nor that
the men of war of the states should serve as a convoy to them  it is
impossible to form an idea more unworthy of the sovereignty of the
states  the idea of granting a convoy to all dutch ships destined for
the port of an enemy is offensive  and still more aggravating  when
accompanied with resistance  or orders to resist  when they go so far
as to reject  ipso facto  all the ordinary ways of public justice  and
to set at nought the articles  which had been established to prevent
the consequences of the intervention of neuters  as parties in a war 
by public acts  articles which stipulate a legal procedure for
discussing all the points in controversy  before the courts of
admiralty reciprocally  and in case the parties should not be
satisfied  they ought to be finally heard by their respective
sovereigns in council  such is the tenor of the twelfth article of the
treaty of 1674 

 in the present state of the cause  this court will not say 
nevertheless  that the states have annulled the treaty  because the
orders of admiral byland have not appeared  and his conduct may be
disavowed by the states  but even the granting of a convoy  and above
all of a squadron  is essentially offensive  since the dutch subjects
are already sufficiently armed by the treaty  and by the methods of
redress prescribed  which are the same with all maritime nations  the
party complaining follows the ship and the papers  which she has on
board  into the jurisdiction of the place and country where he is
carried  as the subject  who in the nature of things and proceedings 
can only of necessity be judged there  where the original proofs
exist  the judges specially constituted  for the decision of prizes 
both in the first instance and in the last resort  are  by common
consent  charged to hear and determine all national differences
between powers who are friends and allies  like the council of
amphyctions in ancient greece  but seamen do not well comprehend this
language  they speak roughly  like the mouths of their cannons  if
this vessel had fired upon the boat  and any one had thereby lost his
life  i think i should not have hesitated to condemn her upon general
principles  neither admiral byland  nor his instructions  are before
me  i know not how to give a sentence against him or his vessels 
nevertheless  he ought not to have fired upon the boat of commodore
fielding  but he was bound to send to him his boat  and to propose an
interview and an amicable conference  he might have made him a visit 
which he immediately would have returned  and all the captains of the
dutch merchant ships might have been ordered on board the english
commodore  to produce their passports and cockets  the effect of his
resistance is thus the cause  that  although i do not declare the
treaty null generally  nevertheless  in retaliation to these vessels
taken in time of resistance  i ought to declare the ship forfeited of
its privilege  and foreclosed of the treaty  by the act of    byland 
there was certainly never any vessel under convoy without
instructions  at least in her course  and without signals  if the
claimants had not withheld them  it would have appeared  whether the
dutch admiral ought  or ought not to have escorted these ships even
into the ports of france  which would have aggravated the offence
against the treaty  a convoy of a single ship  destined for the
states  destined for the colonies of the states  or loaded generally
with innocent commodities  is  in itself  inoffensive  because  in
these times  there are in all the seas little pirates  furnished with
all sorts of commissions  american  french  spanish  and english  but
a squadron of a line of battle ships  and which appears force     even
to the treaty  which they claim the benefit of  is a serious affair 
to engage in hostilities is not the way of protecting commerce  and
those who have solicited the states to grant such a convoy  were
rather factious americans  or intriguing french politicians  than
solid  sensible dutchmen  true and real friends of their country 
there is certainly among them a number of worthy people  who can never
desire to become  in fact  a province  under the obedience of the king
of france  or his resident minister 

 the case of the swedish convoy is not applicable to this case  that
convoy had not made any resistance  the ships entered the downs by the
bad weather  and were there taken without their convoy  which came to
anchor near them  this was represented  and the course of justice was
followed  the ship   papers were produced directly in this court  the
requisites were done  and the causes finally discussed according to
the style of the admiralty   velo levato   no time was lost  either in
contesting the justice or demanding right  and the captains of the
ships returned contented with their vessels after they had been paid
the freight  as well as the expense  and the naval stores  which they
had on board  were purchased by the government  by virtue of powers
granted to the council of the royal marine  by act of parliament  in
conformity to acts of parliament in former wars 

 the question  whether the hemp and flax are contraband  is clear 
both of them have been adjudged such on all former occasions  when the
quantity has been considerable  and particularly  when they are not of
the produce of the country of the party which carries them  the flax
is as necessary for sails  as the hemp for cordage  and if this court
has once ordered that flax should be sold to the commissioners of the
navy  it was because it was of little value  and in very small
quantity  i am sorry to learn  that the navy board makes any
difficulty upon this subject  the iron on board was only for ballast  

i cannot go through with the whole of this decree for want of time 
but the following curious and convenient doctrine ought not to be
omitted 

 that  which in the natural or intellectual world is called quality 
is not relative  good and evil are relative  everything is what it is 
and acquires its denomination from comparison  degree  manner 
quality  place  time  person  fault          these relations
constitute the metaphysical essence of every complex idea in the human
understanding  hence that source  without end  of disputes  the glory
of the bar  and of the schools of philosophy 

 grotius and bynkershoeck agree  and who is there that will deny  that
necessity gives a right to make ourselves masters of everything 
without the seizure of which a nation cannot defend herself  as in
relation to want  if the enemy  on one part  is in want of stores  the
want to intercept them on the other is equal  and in relation to
blockades  every port of the enemy is blocked relative to a neutral
vessel loaded with stores  which is seized  and  by consequence 
blocked  or hindered to go there  it imports little  that whether the
blockade be made across the narrows at dover  or off the harbor at
brest  or   orient  if you are taken  you are blocked  great britain 
by her insular situation  blocks naturally all the ports of spain and
france  she has a right to avail herself of this situation  as a gift
of providence 

 in fine  it is necessary to observe  that the claimants  founding
themselves upon the privilege of the treaty  have not a single paper
on board to prove the property of the cargo  in which respect all are
defective  the sentence then  is  that  under the circumstances of
this case  the claim of privilege is rejected  and that the dutch
master be enjoined to produce his sailing orders  and certificates and
cockets from the custom house of the port from whence the ship sailed 
according to the stipulations of the sixth article of the treaty of
1674  the hemp and flax are condemned as contraband on board of this
ship  and the owners of the iron are held to prove their property  

i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect  sir  your most
obedient and most humble servant 

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                               paris  april 7th  1780 

  sir 

there are several articles of intelligence today  which are connected
with the subject of my letter of yesterday  one is from the hague  the
2  of april   thursday night last two couriers from petersburgh
arrived here  alighted at the hotel of the prince gallitzen  the envoy
extraordinary of her majesty the empress of all the russias to the
states general  one of the couriers set off immediately for london  to
the russian minister who resides there  the prince gallitzen having
been in conference the next day with the president of the assembly of
their high mightinesses  relative to the said despatches  this
minister sent back  the next night after his arrival  the same
courier  from that time the report runs  that the object of these
despatches was to communicate to the republic the measures taken by
russia  with some of the northern powers  for ensuring respectively
the safety of the navigation and commerce of their subjects  and to
invite the states general to enter into the same arrangements  

the other is from constantinople  the 14th of february   the
privateers continue to vex the neutral ships in the seas of the grand
seignior  by visiting and stopping them wherever they find them  and
even without any discretion  at the entry of the ports and under the
guns of our fortresses  the french frigate  the gracieuse  which lay
at anchor in the road of cyprus  having learned that an english
privateer had brought into the port of this island a french prize 
sent to her some boats armed to retake her  which they could not
accomplish  however  without having some men killed on both sides  the
english consul having carried his complaints to the government of the
island  of a violation of the laws of nations and demanded assistance 
he was so well succored  that the french were obliged to abandon the
prize  and all of their nation who were in the island came very near
being massacred by the turks  as the porte has also been informed 
that on the other hand the ship smyrna  of rotterdam  has run a risk
of undergoing the same fate with the ship of captain kinder  of
amsterdam  and perhaps to suffer treatment still harder  and in sight
of the city of smyrna  she has not only resolved to send new orders to
all the commandants  to enjoin them very seriously to observe a
neutrality the most exact  by fulfilling their duty  but she has also
testified her sensibility in regard to all these depredations to the
ambassadors of the courts of france and england  by sending to them
last saturday a representation in writing  purporting  that as the
porte had not failed to observe  during the war between france and
england  an exact and perfect neutrality to facilitate their commerce
upon an equal footing  and to afford to their ships all possible
safety in her seas  it was natural that she should  and ought to
expect  that the two powers would answer her conduct with a sincere
friendship  that at the news of the first differences arisen between
the two kingdoms  there were conferences held with their ambassadors 
in which it was agreed upon an equal footing  that the rules of the
sea should not be violated  and that they should be  on the contrary 
exactly observed and respected  that in consequence of this agreement 
the porte had not neglected anything to fulfil of fortresses and
castles in the empire  to protect the ships of war and merchant men
against every attack  and not to suffer that any hostilities should be
commenced in the ports of the grand seignior  and under the cannon and
in sight of his fortresses 

 but in spite of all these measures  these powers had not taken care
to observe them  which was the cause that no nation could now navigate
freely and safely  that even to this time  the porte had not received
the least answer on the subject of a regulation of neutrality  which
had been formed upon the footing of that which had been established
during former wars between christian powers  and of which
communication had been made to the said ambassadors  with a view to
put a stop to the intolerable irregularities which had taken place in
his seas  and to the end to prevent in consequence continual
complaints and representations  that the porte was informed foreign
privateers held his ports blocked up  and forced the ships which
entered into them or went out  without even excepting the turkish
vessels  to submit to their unjust visits and searches 

 that such a conduct  being contrary to the honor of the empire  the
porte ought to determine  as soon as possible  and communicate to the
belligerent powers a good regulation  to the end  to procure by that
means repose  to his subjects  whom providence had confided to his
care  and to this end it was necessary  that the ambassadors of these
two powers should be advertised to request their courts  in the first
place  to send  as soon as possible  to the captains and officers of
ships armed for war  or privateers  precise orders  and as some time
must pass before they can receive such orders  the porte hopes that
the gentlemen  the ambassadors  will be so good in the meantime  as to
order the captains and officers to suspend their operations  and
abstain from all acts of hostility 

 and as  in consequence of the ancient regulations  every time that
any vessels of war or armed ships come into the seas of the grand
seignior  the foreign ministers were held to give notice to the porte
of the object of their expedition or voyage  of their destination  and
of the time they were to stay  it could not but be regarded as
unreasonable  and entirely contrary to the reciprocal friendship  if
these formalities should not be observed  the porte  considering it as
one of its principal duties  to employ all possible means to procure
the tranquillity of its merchants  to protect their possessions
against all force and injustice  as also to grant its protection to
the subjects of the belligerent powers  and those of other powers who
are equally good friends of this empire  

the porte finishes  by giving notice to the ambassadors  that the
capitan pacha was ordered to oppose himself in a friendly manner to
the enterprises of those  who should pursue the ancient proceedings 
and to protect the merchants and the ships of all nations  who carry
on commerce in the countries of this empire  whose sovereigns live in
friendship with the porte 

a third is a letter from petersburg  7th of march   the rencounter
which the dutch convoy  on going out of the texel the later end of
december  under the command of admiral byland  had with the english
squadron under commodore fielding  as well as the violent and hostile
manner in which they made prize of this convoy  have occasioned here
the greatest astonishment  and it is very much desired to know the
consequences of this measure  which is generally considered as very
offensive to the republic of the united provinces  and derogatory both
to the treaties subsisting between the two nations  to the law of
nations  and to the respect which ought to take place between two free
and independent powers  

but that which is thought more extraordinary still  is  that the court
of london should have ordered a step so violent and insulting at a
time when  having to maintain a war so dangerous as that against
france  spain  and the united states of america  her situation must
appear not less anxious than dangerous  which this court itself seems
to acknowledge  by representing as she has done  that not finding
herself in a condition to oppose the dangerous designs of the house of
bourbon  which  if you believe her  threaten the safety of all europe 
she believed herself consequently to have cause to demand succors
here  as well as from the republic of the united provinces  however
this may be  it is nevertheless notorious  that the solicitations of
england have produced no effect here  which has given no small
satisfaction to those  who consider in their proper point of light the
designs and the conduct of this power  since the commencement of this
war against the liberty of commerce and the navigation of free and
independent powers  by means of which people in general seem so much
the more pleased with the present resolution taken by her majesty the
empress of all the russias  relative to the said solicitation  as well
as with the system of neutrality  which she has adopted  because
without this wise measure there is no doubt but great britain would
have pushed much further the irregularity of her proceedings 

the english  who are here  exert themselves as much as they can to
justify and even to praise this proceeding of their nation towards the
said convoy  but in vain have they attempted to induce the public to
adopt this error  by advancing boldly  that the court of russia
approves the violence  which they have exercised in this rencounter 
no man believes them  since in fact it is impossible that the empress
can approve an action so diametrically opposite to the tenor of
treaties  to the law of nations  as well as to the dignity of a
sovereign and independent power  the injustice of which is so
notorious  that if it had been committed with similar circumstances
upon the russian flag  the princess herself would have been the first
to have condemned it  thus the reports  which the english propagate
here  of the approbation given to these proceedings  imply so much the
more of a manifest contradiction to the sentiments and manner of
thinking of the empress and her ministers  that it is well known  that
from the beginning of the present troubles  the court of russia has
made representations and complaints against that of london  for the
violent and arbitrary manner of acting  which this last has indulged
herself in  against the navigation and commerce of neutral powers 
from whence it has resulted  that other nations  in imitation of this
proceeding  have embarrassed business more and more  until there
exists no safety for any  which causes the greatest embarrassment to
merchants and the freighters of ships 

i ought to add to this letter  that the english emissaries  who
propagate false news everywhere and about everything  having
circulated a report  that the porte was discontented with the peace
made with russia  the grand seignior thought it necessary to order the
interpreter of the court to declare to all foreign ministers  that the
sultan and all his ministers had every reason to be very well
satisfied with the accommodation with the empress of russia  and that
he was determined to maintain religiously all the articles contained
in that treaty  all these things tend to show  that the state of
europe continues the same  and that england  instead of getting an
ally  is likely to have a combination of all maritime powers to bring
her to reason 

  i have the honor to be

  sir 

i have this moment the honor of your letter from madrid of the 29th of
february  as i suppose  although the month is not mentioned  i thank
you  sir  for commencing a correspondence  which i have for some time
wished to begin  i wrote to mr jay at madrid  on the 22  of february 
and wish to know if he has received the letter  it is certainly
proper  that those who are intrusted abroad should maintain a
correspondence and cultivate a good understanding with each other 
because  although their departments are in some respects separate  yet
in others they are intimately connected  from all that i heard in
spain  i expected  that you would meet with an agreeable reception at
madrid  and i am much pleased to learn from you  that i was not
mistaken 

i have sometimes wondered at the slowness of spain in making a treaty
with us  but  when i reflected upon a certain secret article  my
surprise ceased  we are already bound in a treaty to her  but she is
not bound to us  it would be ungenerous in her  however  to hold us
long in this situation  the treaty  notwithstanding all that has been
justly said of the advantages to us  is not less advantageous to our
allies  the single article  that binds us to exclude all armed vessels
of the enemies  in all future wars  from our ports  is worth more
millions to them than this war will cost  nay  it will be a severer
loss to great britain  than all that she has spent in it  whether
great britain has considered this or not i do not know  but she will
some time or other discover it  and feel the inconvenience of it 

you ask for news from america  a vessel from baltimore is arrived at
bordeaux  but not a single letter to dr franklin or me  she brings two
or three baltimore newspapers  one as late as the 15th of february 
there has been a hard winter  deep snows  uncommon frosts  frozen over
from connecticut to long island  and from new jersey to staten island 
lord sterling went over to staten island with a party on the ice 
burnt a few vessels and a guard house  took a few prisoners  and
brought off a few deserters  some new jersey people went over at the
same time  and plundered without mercy  finding the communication open
with new york  which had been supposed to be obstructed by the ice  he
returned  an article from a fishkill paper says  that clinton and
cornwallis sailed the 26th of december  with seven thousand men  for
the west indies  but that the storm  which happened soon after their
departure  was supposed to have done him mischief  a ship  brig  and
schooner were lost in the storm on cape cod  unknown who or whence 
all perished  congress had recommended to all the states to regulate
prices at twenty for one  which  by the speculations in the papers 
was not well liked  governor johnson is a delegate for maryland 
general ward for massachusetts  in the room of mr dana   who desires
me to return you his compliments and respects   the other delegates as
last year  this is all the news i can recollect  having seen the
papers only a few minutes in a large company 

the general state of affairs appears very well  i see no probability
of england   obtaining an ally  on the contrary  there are many
symptoms of an approaching combination of the maritime powers  to
protect neutral ships from searches and insults  ireland is in the
full career of independence  england seems determined to force holland
into a war against her  that she may have an opportunity to plunder
her 

the correspondences and associations in england distress the ministry
very much  and  if the war continues and they should not be very
successful  it seems likely  that they would save us the trouble of
despatching them  i wish  however  that france and spain were more
convinced of the advantages they have in america and the west indies 
the more ships they send into those seas  the more they will force
england to send there  and the more she sends there  the weaker she is
in europe  and the less she is dreaded and respected  holland 
ireland  the opposition in england  and the other maritime powers all
feel a confidence rising in proportion to the diminution of the
british naval force in europe  besides the innumerable advantages the
french and spaniards have  in supporting the war in the american seas
over the english  which they have not in europe  but i am apprehensive
of being tedious  my compliments to mr jay and his family 

i am  with much respect  your most obedient and humble servant

  sir 

there are several miscellaneous articles of intelligence  which ought
to be mentioned to congress 

one from copenhagen  of the 25th of march   the count de lucchese 
minister of the king of the two sicilies  and charged at the same time
with the affairs of the court of madrid  has received orders to
declare to ours  that the king of spain had it in contemplation to
make arrangements relative to merchant ships of neutral powers  and
with which we should have cause to be very well pleased  however this
may be  we have not any news that the danish ships detained  to the
number of twenty  at cadiz and malaga  have been as yet released 
which is a great damage to those who are interested in those vessels 

 there is arrived in this city a courier coming from st petersburg 
who has also passed through stockholm  who after having delivered his
despatches to the envoy extraordinary of her majesty  the empress of
all the russias  at this court  immediately continued his journey for
hamburg  

another is from madrid  the 13th of march   it is said that our court
will soon publish a new regulation relative to the dutch navigation 
in the meantime  they have released two ships of this nation  viz  the
griffin and the zandam  which were detained at algeziras 

 the register ships destined for the havana and vera cruz  which are
ready at cadiz  are to sail immediately  these ships will be convoyed
by twelve ships of the line and two frigates  as far as the canary
islands  it is assured  that there will be embarked on board of this
fleet  twelve thousand men  who are to be transported to america under
the command of don victa de nava  lieutenant general  the last letters
from the havana import  that there were in that port fourteen ships of
the line  as well as four thousand men ready to embark for an
expedition  the object of which is yet unknown  two of our cruisers
have entered barcelona with five very rich prizes  among which  one
had on board eighteen thousand guineas  destined for mahon  

another from paris   letters from malta of the 11th of february
inform  that the king   frigate  the syracuse  commanded by    clavel 
off candia  has taken the english cutter  the buck  of twentyfour
guns  twelve swivels  and two hundred and three men  commanded by
captain george flagg  and that the bad condition to which the
engagement had reduced her  had induced him to sink her  

another from francfort  of the 1st of april   they write from hesse 
that they continued to raise many recruits  and that there were at
ziagenham six hundred and eight volunteers  who were to set off in a
little time with eleven hundred and twenty men for america  

another from amsterdam  of the 6th of march   we learn from dort  that
they expected there the english vessels destined to transport the
german troops for the service of england  which were still at
nimeguen  and they write from the hague  that general faucet had
arrived there a few days since  

another from london  of the 31st of march   the despatches  which the
court has last received from sir joseph yorke  excite the particular
attention of the ministry  although the contents of them have not yet
been made public  it is said  nevertheless  that in consequence of the
memorial  presented on the 21st to the states general by the british
minister  their high mightinesses have taken the  pre avis   relative
to the succors demanded by great britain  which  although conceived in
very moderate terms  contains  nevertheless  a refusal to furnish the
succors demanded  the republic  as it is pretended  founding its
inability to comply with this demand principally upon the
non existence of the case of invasion of the british states  as a
case  which alone could lay them under obligation to accede to the
requisition of the king of england  the count de welderen  envoy
extraordinary of the states general  has been on the 29th in
conference with lord stormont  and communicated to him the  pre avis 
of their high mightinesses  relative to the requisition of his
britannic majesty  upon the subject of which the states general will
soon take a formal resolution  it is reported also  that his
excellency has likewise imparted to our ministry the sentence of a
court martial  which has adjudged  that count byland was not the
aggressor in the affair of the seizure of the dutch ships by
commodore fielding  however  it is asserted  that the court of st
james has declared afresh   that if the states general refuse to
furnish to england the succors demanded in virtue of the treaties  she
will give orders to search  without distinction  all dutch ships under
convoy and without convoy  and that all the merchandises and effects
destined for the french and spaniards  which shall be found loaded on
board of these vessels  shall be seized and confiscated  adding  that
it is neither just nor reasonable  that the republic should be
excused  on her part  from the observation of the treaties  while
england should be held on hers to fulfil the conditions  and that
thus  in consequence of her former declaration  the republic should be
no more considered but on the footing of other neutral powers  

 they say  moreover  that the reasons alleged by their high
mightinesses in justification of their refusal to acquiesce in the
demand of england  are of a nature to convince our ministry  that such
an acquiescence would produce consequences equally hurtful to the
respective interests of the two powers in the present conjuncture 

 we are assured  that each man of the crews of the squadron of
commodore fielding  will receive more than nine pounds sterling  for
his share of the proceeds of the captures made of the dutch convoy 
and that there will be two hundred pounds sterling paid to the king  
ships at spithead  for their part of the prizes which they have made 

 the court has received  within a few days  a great number of
despatches from its ministers at foreign courts  the contents of which
have given occasion to several cabinet councils  those of sir joseph
yorke have excited a particular attention 

 the officers of all the vessels of war destined for sea  have
received orders to repair on board as soon as possible  and be ready
to sail on the first notice  the officers of the regiments of regular
troops  and of the militia  must also join their respective corps
without delay  that they may be ready to march by the middle of april 
the forces will encamp nearly in the same place as last year  and
there will be some detached corps ready to join the different camps
according to circumstances  

i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect and esteem

  sir 

the  memoire  of the prince gallitzen  envoy extraordinary from the
empress of all the russias to the states general  presented the third
of this month  is of too much importance to the united states of
america  and their allies  to be omitted to be sent to congress  it is
of the following tenor 

    high and mighty lords 

      the undersigned  envoy extraordinary of her majesty  the empress
     of all the russias  has the honor to communicate a copy of the
     declaration  which the empress  his sovereign  has made to the
     powers actually at war  your high mightinesses may regard this
     communication  as a particular mark of the attention of the
     empress to the republic  equally interested in the reasons which
     have given birth to this declaration 

      he has  moreover  orders to declare  in the name of her imperial
     majesty  that how much soever she may desire  on the one hand  to
     maintain during the present war the strictest neutrality  she
     will  nevertheless maintain  by means the most efficacious  the
     honor of the russian flag  and the safety of her commerce  and
     the navigation of her subjects  and will not suffer that any
     injury should be done to it by any of the belligerent powers 
     that to avoid  on this occasion  all misunderstanding or false
     interpretation  she has thought it her duty to specify in her
     declaration the terms of a free commerce  and of that which is
     called contraband  that if the definition is founded upon notions
     the most simple  the most clear  and the most determinate by the
     law of nature  that of the latter is taken by her literally from
     the treaty of commerce of russia with great britain  that by this
     she proves incontestably her good faith  and her impartiality
     towards both parties  that she thinks  consequently  that she
     ought to expect  that the other commercial powers will be earnest
     to accede to her manner of thinking relative to the neutrality 

      in pursuance of these two views  her majesty has charged the
     subscriber to invite your high mightinesses to make a common
     cause with her  insomuch  that this union may serve to protect
     commerce and navigation  observing at the same time the most
     exact neutrality  and to communicate to you the measures which
     she has taken in consequence  similar invitations have been
     already made to the courts of copenhagen  stockholm  and lisbon 
     to the end  that by the common cares of all neutral maritime
     powers  a neutral system  founded on justice  and which  by its
     real utility  may serve as a rule for future ages  may be
     established and made legal in favor of the commercial navigation
     of neutral nations  the subscriber makes no doubt  that your high
     mightinesses will take into consideration the invitation of her
     imperial majesty  and concur in making  without delay  a
     declaration to the belligerent powers  founded upon the same
     principles with those of the empress  his sovereign  by
     explaining your sentiments at the same time upon the subject of
     the protection of your commerce  of your navigation  and of the
     nature of contraband goods  conformably to the terms of your
     particular treaties with other nations  moreover  the subscriber
     has the honor to assure your high mightinesses  that if  for
     establishing solidly a system  equally glorious and advantageous
     to the prosperity of navigation in general  you will commence a
     negotiation with the neutral powers abovementioned  to the end to
     establish a particular convention upon this subject  the empress 
     his sovereign  will be ready to engage in it 

      your high mightinesses will readily perceive the necessity of
     coming to a resolution upon subjects equally important and
     advantageous to humanity in general 

      the subscriber requests the favor  that your high mightinesses
     would furnish him with a speedy answer 

                                                           gallitzen  

                                                   

                             declaration

      of her majesty  the empress of russia  made to the courts of
         versailles  madrid  and london  mentioned in the foregoing
         memorial  

 the empress of all the russias has manifested so visibly the
sentiments of justice  equity  and moderation  which animate her  and
has given  during the whole course of the war maintained against the
ottoman porte  such convincing proofs of her attention to the rights
of neutrality  and the freedom of commerce in general  that  in this
respect  she may appeal to the testimony of all europe  this conduct 
as well as the scrupulous exactness with which she has observed the
rules of neutrality during the course of this war  has given her room
to hope  that her subjects would peaceably enjoy the fruits of their
industry  and the advantages  which belong to all neutral nations 
experience has  however  taught her the contrary  since neither these
considerations  nor the regard due to what the law of nations in
general prescribes  have been able to hinder the subjects of her
majesty from being oftentimes troubled in their navigation  or
interrupted or retarded in their commerce  by the subjects of the
belligerent powers  these interruptions having come upon business in
general  and that of russia in particular  are of a nature to awaken
the attention of all the neutral nations  and oblige her majesty  the
empress  to seek to deliver herself from them by all means suitable to
her dignity and the well being of her subjects 

 but before she shall put them in execution  being filled with a
sincere desire to prevent all subsequent acts of violence  she has
thought that it was consistent with her equity to lay open to all
europe the principles  which will govern her  and which are
indispensable to prevent all misunderstanding  as well as all which
might give occasion to it  to this she has determined herself with so
much the more confidence  as these principles are drawn from the
primitive law of nations  and adopted by all nations  which the
belligerent powers themselves cannot enervate  at least not without
violating the laws of neutrality  and contemning the fundamental rules
which they themselves have adopted  in divers treaties and alliances
now existing 

 article i  that all neutral vessels ought to navigate freely from one
port to another  as well as upon the coasts of the powers now at war 

 article ii  that the effects belonging to the subjects of the
belligerent powers shall be free in neutral ships  excepting always
contraband goods 

 article iii  that her imperial majesty  in consequence of the limits
above fixed  will adhere strictly to that which is stipulated by the
tenth and eleventh articles of her treaty of commerce with great
britain  concerning the manner in which she ought to conduct towards
all the belligerent powers 

 article iv  that as to what concerns a port blocked up  we ought not
in truth to consider as such any but those  which are found so well
shut up by a fixed and sufficient number of vessels belonging to the
power which attacks it  that one cannot attempt to enter into such
port without evident danger 

 article    that these principles above laid down ought to serve as a
rule in all proceedings  whenever there is a question concerning the
legality of prizes 

 from these considerations  her imperial majesty makes no difficulty
to declare  that wishing to insure the execution of that  which is
herein before declared  to maintain at the same time the honor of her
flag  as well as the safety of the commerce of her states  and also to
protect the navigation of her subjects against all those whom it may
concern  she has given orders that a considerable portion of her
maritime forces shall be put to sea  with no other intention than to
insure the observation of the most exact and the most strict
neutrality  which her majesty proposes to keep as long as she shall
not see herself absolutely forced to depart from that system of
moderation and of perfect neutrality  which she has adopted  in such
sort  that it will not be but in the last extremity  that her fleet
will exercise her final orders to go wherever the necessity and the
circumstances may require 

 it is then by assuring the belligerent powers in the most solemn
manner  and with all that rectitude and sincerity  which form the
distinguishing character of her imperial majesty  that she declares to
them that she proposes to herself no other thing  than to convince
them of the sentiments of equity with which she is animated  as well
as of the tendency of her salutary views towards the well being of all
nations in general  and particularly of those now at war  and that
consequently her imperial majesty will provide her admiralty as well
as her generals with instructions relative to this system  extracted
from the code of nations  and which they have so often taken for rules
in their treaties  

  i have the honor to be

in all  twentyfive counties 

the first meeting of the delegates was march the 11th  1780  the
cities and towns  which have agreed upon similar petitions  are
london  westminster  york  bristol  cambridge  nottingham  newcastle 
reading  and bridgewater 

the counties  which have not yet agreed upon petitions  are
westmoreland  durham  lancaster  salop  stafford  lincoln  leicester 
warwick  oxford  worcester  cornwall  and rutland  hants agreed on a
petition  but appointed no committee  and northampton agreed to
instruct their members on the points of the petition 

this account takes no notice of the twelve welsh counties  these 
however  are small 

the counties  which have already petitioned  it seems  therefore  are
a vast majority of the kingdom in numbers as well as property and
understanding  and the meeting of their committees may be reasonably
considered as a more equitable and adequate representation of the
people of england  than the house of commons 

amidst all the addresses  instructions  petitions  associations  and
resolutions  i never found one that dared to expose the true cause of
their miseries  and to propose a remedy  until the association of the
county of york appeared  which was agreed to by the committee of
sixtyone  to be recommended to the general meeting of the county of
york  held the 28th of march  1780 

they declare their unanimous assent 

1st  to the economical reform requested by the petitions of the
people 

2dly  to the proposition for obtaining a more equal representation of
the people in parliament  by the addition of at least one hundred
knights  to be chosen in a due proportion by the several counties of
great britain 

3dly  to the proposition for the members of the house of commons to be
elected  to serve in parliament for a term not exceeding three years 

but the most important resolution of all was also unanimous   that it
is the opinion of this meeting  that the prosecution of an offensive
war in america is most evidently a measure  which  by employing our
great and enormously expensive military operations against the
inhabitants of that country  prevents this from exerting its united 
vigorous  and firm efforts against the powers of france and spain 
and has no other effect upon america  than to continue  and thereby to
increase the enmity  which has so long and so fatally subsisted
between the arms of both  can be productive of no good whatever  but
by preventing conciliation  threatens the accomplishment of the ruin
of the british empire  

this meeting  which is said to have been the largest ever known  and
perfectly unanimous  gave power to the committee of association to
call the county together when they should judge proper 

after all  even this committee does not appear to see the true
interest of the country  the necessity of peace  peace alone can save
them  they are for leaving america  which is a great thing  but it
does not appear but that they are still for continuing the war with
our allies 

an article of the 4th of april says  that commotions are reported to
have arisen in the county of york  many of the inhabitants of which
have peremptorily refused to pay the taxes 

congress will observe by the paragraphs in the morning post of april
the 1st  that they seem to be in england totally ignorant of the
designs of the empress of russia  and of the other neutral powers 

the paper of april the 3  contains major general campbell   and
lieutenant colonel dickson   account of the surrender of the port of
baton rouge      with about five hundred regular troops prisoners of
war  to don bernado de galvez  the 21st of september 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams

  sir 

everything which tends to show the probability of a general
association of the maritime powers  against the violences at sea 
which the english have practised  and which other nations  after their
example  have begun  and which tends to prove the justice  the wisdom 
and the humanity of such an association  is worthy of observation  for
my own part  i think  that the abolition of the whole doctrine of
contraband would be for the peace and happiness of mankind  and i
doubt not  as human reason advances  and men come to be more sensible
of the benefits of peace  and less enthusiastic for the savage glories
of war  all neutral nations will be allowed  by universal consent  to
carry what goods they please in their own ships  provided they are not
bound to places actually invested by an enemy 

 constantinople  march the 3     the porte having received the
disagreeable news  that three xebecs from malta had seized upon a
large turkish ship with a rich cargo of coffee  rice  hemp  and other
productions  this advice has accelerated the departure of two
men of war and four gallies  which will go before the fleet of the
grand admiral  to cruise in the archipelago  and protect the
navigation of the european nations against the vexations of the french
and english  

 copenhagen  march the 28th    captain zagel  the courier of her
majesty  the empress of all the russias  is returned to petersburgh 
accompanied by captain socolousky  secretary of the russian consul in
the sound  they are very busy here in equipping the vessels of war 
the wagrie  of sixtyfour guns  the infodstretten  of sixtyfour  and
the frigate combord  of thirtyfour  

 london  april the 4th    there are lately arrived here interesting
despatches to government from sir joseph yorke  which contain some
further explanations of the dispositions of the republic  in
consequence of the last memorial presented to their high mightinesses
by that minister  and the resolution to protect the commerce of their
subjects  however this may be  there are actually in the ports of this
kingdom fifty dutch vessels seized by our ships of war  because they
were found loaded with naval stores for our enemies  and  already the
most of their cargoes have been adjudged good prizes  these articles
being considered as contraband  and their transportation to an enemy
contrary to treaties subsisting between the republic and england  

 hague  april the 9th    we learn  that the states of the province of
overyssell have sent to the assembly of their high mightinesses their
instructions  relative to the two memorials presented by sir joseph
yorke  the 28th of july  and the 26th of november  of the last year 
the first purporting a demand of succors stipulated by the treaty of
1678  and the second demanding an immediate and categorical answer 
the contents of the instructions are   that their noble mightinesses 
after having maturely reflected upon all which concerns the matter in
question  especially upon the treaties existing between the kingdom
and the republics  as well as the obligations  which the two nations
had mutually laid themselves under  and also in particular  upon the
present situation in which this republic now stands in several points
respecting her own preservation  the maintenance of her rights and
possessions  and respecting the powers actually at war  judge  that
the two memorials presented by sir joseph yorke may and ought to be
answered in the following manner  that all the principles alleged  and
the circumstances at this time existing  oblige their high
mightinesses more than ever to watch carefully their own preservation
and defence  to use every effort to ward off all further dangerous
consequences  and to this end  to request his majesty not to take it
in ill part  if in the critical situation of affairs  in which the
least diminution of their forces might be dangerous  their high
mightinesses think themselves lawfully authorised to refuse the
succors demanded by his majesty  although these succors  considering
certain engagements  the pretended application of which it would be
useless at this time to search into  may be judged indispensable by
his majesty  in the firm confidence  that  in the circumstances in
which their high mightinesses find themselves  his majesty  not
disapproving  of their conduct  will desist  not only from demanding
their assistance  but on the contrary  as a proof of the affection of
which his majesty had so often given them assurances  will permit them
invariably to pursue that neutrality  which from the beginning of the
present troubles they have adopted  

 it is asserted  that on the memorial presented by the prince
gallitzen  envoy extraordinary of the empress of russia  their high
mightinesses have provisionally concluded   that having taken the said
memorial into consideration  the deputies of the respective provinces
have sent copies of it  as well as of the papers annexed to it  to be
communicated to their assemblies  praying them to procure  as soon as
possible  the resolutions of the states  their constituents  

 in the meantime  since the said memorial has been made public  it is
given out  that the convention between the courts of petersburgh 
stockholm  and copenhagen  will in a little time be confirmed  and
that denmark will procure  on certain conditions  five or six thousand
seamen for this republic 

 we learn that the answer of his britannic majesty to the
representations which the count de walderen  minister of the
states general at the court of london  has been charged by their high
mightinesses to make to the british government  relative to a
prolongation of the term of three weeks  prescribed in the last
memorial of sir joseph yorke  for giving him a definitive answer     
arrived the 31st of last month  and is found to be in the negative 
the king insisting on an answer by the time fixed  which will expire
next tuesday 

 they give out  that the cities of dantzic  lubec  bremen  hamburgh 
    will adopt  as well as most of the northern powers  the party of
neutrality  and that  if england persists in the practice of visiting 
stopping  and searching neutral vessels  denmark is resolved to
exclude english vessels from the sound  

to judge of things the most impartially  no man can doubt  that
proceedings so violent  and so contrary to the natural rights of
nations  will make the neutral powers  feel  how much it imports them
to set bounds to the intolerable excesses  to which their vessels 
sailing under the faith of treaties  are daily exposed by the ships of
one party in the present war 

  i have the honor to be     

                                                           john adams 

                                                   

                   to the president of congress 

                                              paris  april 15th  1780 

  sir 

there is an article from hamburgh which deserves attention  it is
this 

 the neutrality of the powers of the north is decided  they have
profited of the divisions  which have arisen between england and north
america  by selling to the former  timber  cordage  hemp  and tar 
which she formerly drew from her colonies  the occasions  which the
enemies of great britain have also had for these articles  have
established a competition  which has procured great advantages to the
commerce of the north  they have everywhere taken measures to protect
it  

in vain has england sought assistance from that quarter  her conduct
has irrevocably deprived her of it 

 leghorn  22  of march    we learn from naples  that the king has
purchased of the order of malta two vessels  to increase the marine of
that kingdom  his majesty is attentively engaged in the care of
forming officers for this department  the young gentry  whom he has
sent to serve on board of the squadrons of the belligerent powers 
have all of them distinguished themselves  and those who remain at
naples  under the direction of the chevalier aston  have discovered
equal zeal  intelligence  and good will  for the service of the
marine  

 madrid  25th of march    our squadrons  they write from cadiz the
16th of this month  will put to sea without delay  transport ships are
taken up on freight with great activity  and all the troops are
arrived  the following is an exact state of the armament 

 the complete regiments of the king  guadalajara  arragon  soria  and
the second regiment of catalonia  in all ten battalions  making six
thousand and six hundred men 

 the squadron of    solano  the st louis  of eighty guns  the st
augustine  the orient  the gaillard  the arrogant  all of seventy
guns  and the rule of sixty guns 

 the squadron of    tomaseo  the st nicholas  of eighty guns  the
eugene  the damase  the st janizer  the st francis  the assisse  and
the warrior  all of seventy guns 

 the first squadron takes in provisions for five months  and the
second for four months and a half  they fill up the regiments  which
are destined for the expedition  with soldiers from the regiment of
hibernia 

 the beautiful wools of segovia have not been always employed within
the kingdom  because the love of labor has not been predominant  but
since the establishment of the royal patriotic society  industry has
recovered its activity     laurent ortiz de paz has established
spinneries of wool in that city  and in st ildephonso  and other
places  his majesty has assigned rewards for men and women  who shall
distinguish themselves in this kind of labor  this measure cannot fail
to establish the royal manufacture of fine cloth  which the marquis of
enseñada had already erected at segovia  and which had fallen into
decay with the favor of that minister  

there are in some of the papers hints of a plan of pacification  which
is said to come from the rockingham party  the substance of it is as
follows 

 let us open our eyes  the hope of subjecting america is a chimera 
nothing but clemency can ever open a way for a reconciliation with
its inhabitants  to show that we wish it sincerely let us give up nova
scotia  that dry  uninhabitable  and languishing colony  which
produces nothing  let us also permit the canadians to institute a form
of government  which may be agreeable to themselves  and let the
independence of north america become the object of our support  sooner
or later it will be unavoidable  that america should separate herself
from us  and i should be very glad that a permanent system of alliance
should take place between them and their mother country  before our
ancient colonies shall be united to france  by ties too strict to be
relaxed  i am persuaded  that neither nova scotia nor canada will
remain long under the government of england  and it is to be feared 
that in contending for them we shall still further embroil affairs 
nova scotia is not worth the trouble of keeping it  and it will
require continual succors  canada will occasion us more expense than
it will bring us in profit  and will never become flourishing under an
european government  at least unless the whole country should be
recovered  we deceive ourselves if we imagine  that by emancipating
the americans we shall lose our american islands  we hold these by the
strongest of all ties  which is  that of their own interest  north
america will not seek to make conquests so long as it shall be divided
into distinct states  and under a republican form of government  and
it is probable  that several centuries will pass away before she will
change the form of her administrations  commerce will return into
england  and into our islands  without any other motive than that
which actuates all the commercial nations of the earth  if we were now
disembarrassed of the objects of dispute  concerning which spain
discovers so many pretensions  and if we could content ourselves with
a superiority at sea  all that would result from it would be  that our
trade to the levant would increase  we should become more respectable 
and we should see ourselves more in a condition to maintain our
quarrels  and protect our rich possessions  without hazarding a
bankruptcy by expenses  which we cannot sustain  our maritime power
will always be sufficient to protect our islands  our naval forces
will never want anything so long as we shall have divers markets 
where our vessels may go  the northern powers of europe  and the
northern states of america  will be competitors to serve us  so long
as we preserve the superiority upon the sea  and while  by means of
our manufacturers  we can pay for them  or make an advantageous
exchange  with the one and the other  we have as good a right to
things  which we can purchase in divers foreign markets  as if the
things were the productions of our own establishments 

 are france and spain in want of warlike stores  are they not as well
supplied with them as we are  and do they not make sweden rather
incline to their side  by means of their commerce with that country
for these articles  is it probable that they can ever shut up from us
the ports of america  of russia  of denmark  and of sweden  while it
is the interest of these states to furnish us  it is necessary  then 
to resolve to demand peace by the means which offer themselves  and
which are not only able to obtain it  but may still be preserved  and
in which there is no appearance that we shall be disturbed  if  at
least  at all times we preserve our marine upon a respectable footing 
and  if we do not  we ever subject ourselves to be restrained upon the
article of the number of ships  and in the places where we shall
employ them  in that case we shall not perceive that gibraltar or
minorca is wanting to us  we shall always be ready to meet our enemies
in those parts where our safety  security  and riches lie  and which
nature points out to us as our proper element  surrounded on all sides
by the sea  there is one half of the nation whose inhabitants
understand navigation  from their infancy  and they are disposed to
become seamen because they are almost educated with the sea  but
whenever we shall engage ourselves in the wars of the continent  we
shall never draw from them any solid advantages  where are the
trophies so dearly purchased of king william and marlborough  and
where is the benefit of the two last wars  the balance of power will
not remain long in our hands  although we have engaged the annual
produce of an innumerable quantity of taxes 

 in america we have destroyed the balance  which held our colonies in
dependence  we ought not  then  to lose the opportunity of binding the
interests of the united states with ours by some amicable convention 
which will assure us of their attachment  and deliver us from the
cruel necessity of continuing the war with our own children  it is by
this means we may preserve for a long time our insular property  and
enjoy still a superiority at sea  

 paris  april 11th 1780    the ambassador of russia has notified 
within a few days past  to our court  that it was the intention of his
sovereign that the commerce of the subjects of her empire should not
be troubled  and that under no pretence should their vessels be
stopped by those of the belligerent powers  and that she is arming to
defend her flag  and protect it from insults  this declaration was to
be made at the same time to the courts of madrid and london  it is
asserted  that it is the first fruit of a treaty of commerce  which
russia has concluded with us  and of a confederation which she has
entered into with the other northern powers  and in which they wish to
engage holland and portugal  we are very inquisitive to learn how this
notification will be received by the court of st james  

the english ministerial gazettes propagate a report  that there was
arrived in europe a deputy of congress to offer peace to great
britain  those of the opposition assert  that this deputy who is in
fact arrived  will do nothing but in concert with france  when it
shall please england to propose a negotiation of peace 

the following article is published in the english papers  to excite
the people against the opposition 

 if the marquis of rockingham should come again into the
administration  his first operation would most probably be  to declare
america independent  this would  nevertheless  be a fatal resolution 
which  instead of giving us peace  would throw that event still
farther off  a proof so striking of our pusilanimity would raise still
higher the hopes and the pride of the house of bourbon  france would
demand that we should restore to them canada  cape breton  and nova
scotia  as well as the islands which were taken from her the last war 
nothing less would be necessary for spain than the restitution of
gibraltar and jamaica  but it cannot but be supposed  that the marquis
of rockingham is too much attached to his head to expose it to danger
by so shameful a dismemberment of our empire  he would then make us
continue the war with the disadvantage of not being able any longer to
rein in the americans  who would assist everywhere their allies by
land and by sea  but every englishman of good sense sees to what
disasters this plan of conduct would lead us  the ambition of this
marquis and of his party is not to triumph over rebels  and the
natural enemies of england  it is to humble his king and ruin his
country

  sir 

i have received the two letters  which your excellency did me the
honor to write to me  on the 5th and on the 12th of this month 

i do not mean to give your excellency the trouble of answering these
letters of mine  which contain extracts of letters from abroad  or
simply news  this would be giving your excellency too much trouble 
and taking up too much time  indeed  i think it will very probably be
often  if not always unnecessary  because your excellency  
information must be  beyond all comparison  earlier  more exact  and
more particular than mine  yet  as it is possible that sometimes a
circumstance of importance may escape one channel of intelligence  and
yet pass in another  i thought it to be my duty sometimes to send your
excellency an extract  in this view  i now have the honor to send your
excellency another extract from a letter of the 6th of this month  but
i pray your excellency not to take the trouble to answer it 

  i have the honor to be

just sixteen 

a little knight of labor 


the first real snow storm of the winter had come to sandyport by the
sea 

it had been a late and merciful autumn  till well into november the
leaves still clung to their boughs  honeysuckles made shady coverts on
trellises  and put forth now and then an orange and milk white blossom
full of frosty sweetness  the grass was still green where the snow
allowed it to be seen  thick and fast fell the wind blown flakes on the
lightly frozen ground  the patter and beat of the flying storm was a
joyous sound to children who owned sleds and had been waiting the chance
to use them  many a boy   face looked out as the dusk fell  to make sure
that the storm continued  and many a bright voice cried   hurrah  it  
coming down harder than ever  to morrow it will be splendid   stable men
were shaking out fur robes and arranging cutters  already the fitful
sound of sleigh bells could be heard  and all the world  the world of
sandyport that is  was preparing to give the in coming winter a gay
welcome 

but in one house in an old fashioned but still respectable street no one
seemed inclined to join in the general merry making  only two lights
broke its darkness  one shone from the kitchen at the back  where 
beside a kerosene lamp  bethia kendrick  the old time servitor of the
talcott family  was gloomily darning stockings  and otherwise making
ready for departure on the morrow  the other and fainter glow came from
the front room  where without any lamp georgie talcott sat alone beside
her fire 

it was a little fire  and built of rather queer materials  there were
bits of lath and box covers  fence pickets split in two  shavings 
pasteboard clippings  and on top of all  half of an old chopping bowl 
the light material burned out fast  and had to be continually
replenished from the basket which stood on one side the grate 

georgie  in fact  was burning up the odds and ends of her old life
before leaving it behind forever  she was to quit the house on the
morrow  and there was something significant to her  and very sorrowful 
in this disposal of its shreds and fragments  they meant so little to
other people  and so very much to her  the old chopping bowl  for
instance   her thoughts went back from it to the first time she had ever
been permitted to join in the making of the christmas pies  she saw her
mother  still a young woman then  and pretty with the faded elegance
which had been her characteristic  weighing the sugar and plums  and
slicing the citron  while her own daring little hands plied the chopper
in that very bowl  what joy there was in those vigorous dabs and
cross way cuts  how she had liked to do it  and now  the pretty mother 
faded and gray  lay under the frozen turf  on which the snow flakes were
thickly falling  there could be no more christmases for georgie in the
old house  it was sold  and to morrow would close its doors behind her
forever 

she shivered as these thoughts passed through her mind  and rising moved
restlessly toward the window  it was storming faster than ever  the
sight seemed to make the idea of the morrow harder to bear  a big tear
formed in each eye  blurring the white world outside into a dim
grayness  presently one ran down her nose and fell on her hand  she
looked at it with dismay  wiped it hastily off  and went back to the
fire 

 i won   cry  whatever happens  i   resolved on that   she said half
aloud  as she put the other half of the chopping bowl on the waning
blaze  the deep soaked richness of long perished meats was in the old
wood still  it flared broadly up the chimney  georgie again sat down by
the fire and resumed her thinking 

 what am i going to do   she asked herself for the hundredth time   when
my visit to cousin vi is over  i must decide on something  but what  a
week is such a short time in which to settle such an important thing  

it is hard to be confronted at twenty with the problem of one   own
support  georgie hitherto had been as happy and care free as other
girls  her mother  as the widow of a naval officer  was entitled to a
small pension  this  with a very little more in addition  had paid for
georgie   schooling  and kept the old house going in a sufficiently
comfortable though very modest fashion  but mrs  talcott was not by
nature an exemplary manager  it was hard not to overrun here and there 
especially after georgie grew up  and  took her place in society   as
the poor lady phrased it   the place which was rightfully hers as her
father   daughter and the descendant of a long line of talcotts and
chaunceys and wainwrights  she coveted pretty things for her girl  as
all mothers do  and it was too much for her strength always to deny
herself 

so georgie had  just this  and  just that   and being a fresh attractive
creature  and a favorite  made her little go as far as the other girls 
much  and now and again the tiny capital was encroached upon  and then 
and then   this is a world of sorry chances  as the weak and helpless
find to their cost   came the bad year  when the ranscuttle mills passed
their dividend and the stock went down to almost nothing  and then mrs 
talcott   long illness  and then her death  sickness and death are
luxuries which the poor will do well to go without  georgie went over
the calculations afresh as she sat by the fire  and the result came out
just the same  and not a penny better  when she had paid for her
mother   funeral  and all the last bills  she would have exactly a
hundred and seventy five dollars a year to live upon   that and no more 

the furniture   could she get something for that  she glanced round the
room  and shook her head  the articles were neither handsome enough nor
quaint enough to command a good price  she looked affectionately at the
hair cloth sofa on which her mother had so often lain  at the well worn
secretary  how could she part with these  how could she sell her
great grandfather   picture  or who  in fact  except herself  would care
for the rather ill painted portrait of a rigid old worthy of the last
century  in a wig and ruffled shirt  with a view of sandyport harbor by
way of a background  her father   silhouette hung beneath it  with his
sword and a little mezzotint of his ship  these were treasures to her 
but what were they to any one else 

 no   she decided   bethia shall take the old kitchen things and her own
bedroom furniture  and have the use of them  but the rest must go into
miss sally   attic for the present  they wouldn   fetch anything  and if
they would  i don   think i could bear to sell them  and now that is
settled  i must think again  what  am  i to do  i must do something  

she turned over all manner of schemes in her mind  but all seemed
fruitless  sew  the town was full of sempstresses  georgie knew of half
a dozen who could not get work enough to keep them busy half the time 
teach  she could not  her education in no one respect had been thorough
enough  embroider for the women   exchanges and decorative art
societies  perhaps  but it seemed to her that was the very thing to
which all destitute people with pretensions to gentility fled as a
matter of course  and that the market for tidies and  splashers  and
pine pillows was decidedly overstocked 

 it   no use thinking about it to night   was the sensible decision to
which she at last arrived   i am too tired  i ll get a sound night  
sleep if i can  and put off my worries till i am safely at miss
sally    

the sound night   sleep stood georgie in good stead  for the morrow
taxed all her powers of endurance  both physical and moral  bethia 
unhappy at losing the home of years  was tearful and fractious to a
degree  sending off the furniture through the deep snow proved a slow
and troublesome matter  the doors necessarily stood open a great deal 
the rooms grew very cold  everything was comfortless and dispiriting 
and underlying all  put aside but never unfelt  was a deep sense of pain
at the knowledge that this was the last day   the very  very last of the
home she had always known  and might know no more 

when the final sledge load creaked away over the hard frozen crust 
georgie experienced a sense of relief 

     the sooner  tis over  the sooner to sleep  

she sang below her breath  everything was in order  she had generalled
all ably  nothing was omitted or forgotten  with steady care she raked
out the fire in the kitchen stove  which the new owner of the house had
taken off her hands  and saw to the fastenings of the windows  then she
tied on her bonnet and black veil  gave the weeping bethia a good by
kiss on the door step  closed and locked the door  and waded wearily
through the half broken paths to the boarding house of miss sally
scannell  where cousin vi  otherwise miss violet talcott  had lived for
years 

no very enthusiastic reception awaited her  cousin vi   invitation had
been given from a sense of duty  she  owed it to the child   she told
herself  as she cleared out a bureau drawer  and made a place for
georgie   trunk in the small third story room which for sixteen years
had represented to her all the home she had known  of course such a
visit must be a brief one 

 so you re come   was her greeting as georgie appeared   i thought you  
be here sooner  but i suppose you ve had a good deal to do  i should
have offered to help if the day had not been so cold  come in and take
your things off  

georgie glanced about her as she smoothed her hair  the room bore the
unmistakable marks of spinsterhood and decayed gentility  it was crammed
with little belongings  some valuable  some perfectly valueless  two or
three pieces of spindle legged and claw footed mahogany made an odd
contrast to the common painted bedroom set  miniatures by malbone and
lovely pale lined mezzotints and line engravings hung on the walls amid
a maze of photographs and japanese fans and christmas cards and chromos 
an indescribable confusion of duds encumbered every shelf and table 
and in the midst sat miss vi   tall  meager  dissatisfied self  with
thin hair laboriously trained after the prevailing fashion  and a dress
whose antique material seemed oddly unsuited to its modern cut and
loopings  somehow the pitifulness of the scene struck georgie afresh 

 shall i ever be like this   she reflected 

 now tell me what has happened since the funeral   said her cousin   i
had neuralgia all last week and week before  or i should have got down
oftener  who has called  have the hanburys been to see you  

 ellen came last week  but i was out   replied georgie 

 what a pity  and how did it happen that you were out  you ought not to
have been seen in the street so soon  i think  it   not customary  

 how could i help it   responded georgie  sadly   i had all the move to
arrange for  mr  custer wanted the house for saturday  there was no one
to go for me  

 i suppose you couldn    but it   a pity  it   never well to outrage
conventionalities  have mrs  st  john and mrs  constant carrington
called  

 mrs  carrington hasn    but she wrote me a little note  and dear mrs 
st  john came twice  and brought flowers  and was ever so kind  she
always has been so very nice to me  you know  

 naturally  the st  johns were nobodies till mr  st  john made all that
money in railroads  she is glad enough to be on good terms with the old
families  of course  

 i don   think it   that   said georgie  rather wearily   i think she  
nice because she   naturally so kind hearted  and she likes me  

the tea bell put an end to the discussion  miss sally   welcome was a
good deal warmer than cousin vi   had been 

 you poor dear child   she exclaimed   you look quite tired out  here 
take this seat by the fire  georgie  and i ll pour your tea out first of
all  she needs it  don   she   to cousin vi 

  miss talcott  is rather tired  i dare say   said that lady  icily 
cousin vi had lived for sixteen years in daily intercourse with miss
sally  one of the sunniest and most friendly of women  and had never
once relaxed into cordiality in all that time  her code of manners
included no approximation toward familiarity between a talcott and a
letter of lodgings 

georgie took a different view   thank you so much  dear miss sally   she
said   how good you are  i  am  tired  

 i wish you wouldn   call miss sally  dear    her cousin remarked after
they had gone upstairs   that sort of thing is most disagreeable to me 
you have to be on your guard continually in a house like this  or you
get mixed up with all sorts of people  

georgie let it pass  she was too tired to argue 

 now  let us talk about your plans   miss talcott said next morning 
 have you made any yet  

    o  only that i must find some work to do at once  

 don   speak like that to any one but me   her cousin said sharply 
 there  are  lady like occupations  of course  in which you
can  can  mingle  but they need not be mentioned  or made known to
people in general  

 what  do  you mean  

 i don   know  i   sure  i ve never had occasion to look into the
matter  but i suppose a girl situated as you are could find
something   embroidery  for instance  you could do that for the
decorative art  they give you a number  and nobody knows your real
name  

 i thought of embroidery   said georgie   but i never was very good at
it  and so many are doing it nowadays  besides  it seems to me that
people are getting rather tired of all but the finer sort of work  

 what became of that nephew of mr  constant carrington whom you used to
see so much of two or three years ago   demanded miss vi  irrelevantly 

 bob curtis  i don   quite know where he is  his father failed  don  
you remember  and lost all his money  and bob had to leave harvard and
go into some sort of business  

 oh  did he  he   of no consequence  then  i don   know what made me
think of him  well  you could read to an invalid  perhaps  or go to
europe with some lady who wanted a companion  

 or be second best wing maker to an angel   put in georgie  with a
little glint of humor   cousin vi  all that would be very pleasant  but
i don   think it is likely to happen  i   dreadfully afraid no one wants
me to go to europe  and i must have something to do at once  you know 
i must earn my bread  

 don   use such a phrase  it sounds too coarse for anything  

 i don   think so  cousin vi  i don   mind working a bit  if only i can
hit on something that somebody wants  and that i can do well  

 this is exactly what i have been afraid of   said miss vi 
despairingly   i ve always had a fear that old jacob talcott would break
out in you sooner or later  he has skipped two generations  but he was
bound to show himself some day or other  he had exactly that common sort
of way of looking at things and talking about them   the only talcott i
ever knew of that did  don   you recollect how he insisted on putting
his son into business  and the boy ran away and went to the west indies
and married some sort of creole   all his father   fault 

 now  i ll tell you   she went on after a pause   i ve been thinking
over this matter  and have made up my mind about it  you re not to do
anything foolish  georgie  if you do  you ll be sorry for it all your
life  and i shall never forgive you besides  such a good start as you
have made in society  and all  it will be quite too much if you go and
spoil your chances with those ridiculous notions of yours  now  listen 
if you ll give up all idea of supporting yourself  unless it is by doing
embroidery or something like that  which no one need know about 
i ll  i ll  well  i ll agree to pay your board here at miss sally    and
give you half this room for a year  as likely as not you ll be married
by the end of that time  or if not  something else will have turned up 
any way  i ll do it for one year  when the year is over  we can talk
about the next   and miss talcott folded her hands with the manner of
one who has offered an ultimatum 

if rather a grudging  this was a really generous offer  as georgie well
knew  to add the expense of her young cousin   board to her own would
cost miss vi no end of self denials  pinchings here and pinchings there 
the daily frets and calculations that weigh so heavily  miss talcott  
slender income at its best barely sufficed for the narrow lodgings  to
fight off the shabbiness which would endanger her place in  society  
and to pay for an occasional cab and theatre ticket  not to do  or at
least to seem to be doing and enjoying  what other people did  was real
suffering to cousin vi  yet she was deliberately invoking it by her
proposal 

had it been really made for her sake  had it been quite disinterested 
georgie would have been deeply touched and grateful  as it was  she was
sufficiently so to thank her cousin warmly  but without committing
herself to acceptance  she must think it over  she said 

she did think it over till her mind fairly ached with the pressure of
thought  as the body does after too much exercise  she walked past the
woman   exchange and studied the articles in the windows  there were the
same towels and tidies that had been there two months before  or what
seemed the same  georgie recollected similar articles worked by people
whom she knew about  for which she had been asked to buy raffle tickets 
 she can   get any one to buy it   had been said  depending on such work
for a support seemed a bare outlook  she walked away with a little shake
of her head 

 no   she thought   embroidery wouldn   pay unless i had a  gift   and i
don   seem to have a gift for anything unless it is housework  i always
was good at that  but i suppose i can   exactly take a place as
parlor maid  cousin vi would certainly clap me into an asylum if i
suggested such a thing  how nice it would be to have a real genius for
something  though now that i think of it  a good many geniuses have died
in attics  of starvation  without being able to help themselves  

when she reached home she took a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote
as follows   

     things wanted  

     1  something i can do 

     2  something that somebody wants me to do 

     3  something that all the other somebodies in search of work
     are not trying to do 

round these problems her thoughts revolved  and though nothing came of
them as yet  it seemed to clear her mind to have them set down in black
and white 

meantime the two days   tête à tête  with cousin vi produced one
distinct result  which was  that let come what come might  georgie
resolved that nothing should induce her to stay on at miss sally   as
proposed  and be idle  her healthy and vigorous youth recoiled from the
idea 

 it is really good of her to ask me   she thought   though she only does
it for the honor of the family and the dead and gone talcotts  but what
a life it would be  and for a whole year too  cousin vi has stood it for
sixteen  to be sure  poor thing  but how could she  mother used to say
that she was called a bright girl when she first grew up  surely she
might have made something of herself if she had tried  and if aunt
talcott hadn   considered work one of the seven deadly sins for a lady 
she was handsome  too  even i can recollect her as very good looking 
and here she is  all alone  and getting shabbier and poorer all the
time  i know she sometimes has not money enough to pay her board  and
has to ask miss sally to wait  snubbing her and despising her all the
time  and holding on desperately to her little figment of gentility 
people laugh at her and make fun of her behind her back  they invite her
now and then  but they don   really care for her  what is such a society
worth  i ll take in washing before i ll come to be like cousin vi  

                                        

how little we guess  as we grope in the mists of our own uncertainties 
just where the light is going to break through  georgie talcott 
starting for a walk with her cousin on the third day of her stay at
miss sally    saw the st  john carriage pass them and then pull up
suddenly at the curb stone  but she had no idea that so simple a
circumstance could affect her fate in any manner  it did  though 

mrs  st  john was leaning out of the window before they got to the place
where the carriage stood  and two prettily gloved hands were stretched
eagerly forth 

 georgie  oh georgie  how glad i am to see you out  dear  i made henry
stop  because i want you to get in for a little drive and then come home
with me to lunch  mr  st  john is in new york  i am quite alone  and
i ll give orders that no one shall be admitted  if you will  don   you
think she might  miss talcott  it isn   like going anywhere else  you
know   just coming to me quietly like that  

 i don   see that there would be any impropriety in it   said miss
talcott  doubtfully   though  with you  however  it  is  different  but
please don   mention it to any one  mrs  st  john  it might be
misunderstood and lead to invitations which georgie could not possibly
accept  good morning  

with a stately bend cousin vi sailed down the street  mrs  st  john  i
am sorry to say  made a face after her as she went 

 absurd old idiot   she muttered   such airs   then she drew georgie in 
and as soon as the carriage was in motion pulled her veil aside and gave
her a warm kiss 

 i am so glad to get hold of you again   she said 

mrs  st  john  rich  childless  warm hearted  and not over wise  had
adopted georgie as a special pet on her first appearance in society two
years before  it is always pleasant for a girl to be made much of by an
older woman  and when that woman has a carriage and a nice house  and
can do all sorts of things for the girl   entertainment  it is none the
less agreeable  georgie was really fond of her friend  people who are
not over wise are often loved as much as wiser ones  it is one of the
laws of compensation 

 now tell me all about yourself  and what you have been doing this past
week   said mrs  st  john  as they drove down to the beach  where the
surf rollers had swept the sands clean of snow and left a dry  smooth
roadway for the horses  feet  the sea wore its winter color that day   a
deep purple blue  broken by flashing foam caps  the wind was blowing
freshly  a great sense of refreshment came to georgie  who had been
wearying for a change 

 it has been rather sad and hard   she said   i have had the house to
clear out and close  and all manner of things to do  and i was pretty
tired when i finished  but i am getting rested now  and by and by i want
to talk over my affairs with you  

 plans   asked mrs  st  john 

 not exactly  i have no plans as yet  but i must have some soon  now
tell me what  you  have been doing  

mrs  st  john was never averse to talking about herself  she always had
a mass of experiences and adventures to relate  which though
insignificant enough when you came to analyze them  were so deeply
interesting to herself that somehow her auditors got interested in them
also  georgie  used to her ways  listened and sympathized without
effort  keeping her eyes fixed meanwhile on the shining  shifting
horizon of the sea  and the lovely arch of clear morning sky  how wide
and free and satisfactory it was  how different from the cramped outlook
into which she had perforce been gazing for days back 

 if life could all be like that   she thought 

the st  john house seemed a model of winter comfort  bright 
flower scented  and deliciously warm  as they entered it after their
drive  mrs  st  john rang for her maid to take off their wraps  and led
georgie through the drawing room and the library to a smaller room
beyond  which was her favorite sitting place of a morning 

 we will have luncheon here close to the fire   she said   and be as
cosey as possible  

it was a pretty room  not over large  fitted up by a professional
decorator in a good scheme of color  and crowded with ornaments of all
sorts  after the modern fashion  it was many weeks since georgie had
seen it  and its profusion and costliness of detail struck her as it
never had done before  perhaps she was in the mood to observe closely 

they were still sipping their hot  bouillon  in great comfort  when a
sudden crash was heard in the distance 

 there   said mrs  st  john  resignedly   that   the second since
monday  what is it  now   pierre  

she pushed back her chair and went hurriedly into the farther room 
presently she came back laughing  but looking flushed and annoyed 

 it   really too vexatious   she said   there seems no use at all in
buying pretty things  the servants do break them so  

 what was it this time   asked georgie 

 it was my favorite bit of sèvres  don   you recollect it   two lovely
little shepherdesses in blue watteaus  holding a flower basket between
them  pierre says his feather duster caught in the open work edge of the
basket  

 why do you let him use feather dusters  the feathers are so apt to
catch  

 my dear  what can i do  each fresh servant has his or her theory as to
how things should be cleaned  whatever the theory is  the china goes all
the same  and i can   tell them any better  i don   know a thing about
dusting  

that moment  as if some quick witted fairy had waved her wand  an idea
darted like a flash into georgie   head 

she took five minutes to consider it  while mrs  st  john went on   

 people talk of the hardship of not being able to have things  but i
think it   just as hard to have them and not be allowed to keep them  i
don   dare to let myself care for a piece of china nowadays  for if i do
it   the first thing to go  pierre   a treasure in other respects  but
he smashes most dreadfully  and the second man is quite as bad  and
marie  upstairs  is worse than either  mr  st  john says i ought to be
 mistress of myself  though china fall   but i really can    

georgie  who had listened to this without listening  had now made up her
mind 

 would you like me to dust your things   she said quietly 

 my dear  they  are  dusted  pierre has got through for this time  he
won   break anything more till to morrow  

 oh  i don   mean only to day  i mean every day  yes  i   in earnest  
she went on in answer to her friend   astonished look   i was meaning to
talk to you about something of this sort presently  and now this has
come into my head  you see   smiling bravely   i find that i have got
almost nothing to live upon  there is not even enough to pay my board at
such a place as miss sally    i must do something to earn money  and
dusting is one of the few things that i can do particularly well  

 but  my dear  i never heard of such a thing   gasped poor mrs  st 
john   surely your friends and connections will arrange something for
you  

 they can    they are all dead   replied georgie  sadly   our family has
run out  i ve one cousin in china whom i never saw  and one great aunt
down in tennessee who is almost as poor as i am  and that   all except
cousin vi  

 she   no good  of course  but she   sure to object to your doing
anything all the same  

 oh yes  of course she objects   said georgie  impatiently   she would
like to tie my hands and make me sit quite still for a year and see if
something won   happen  but i can   and won   do it  and  besides  what
is there to happen  nothing  she was kind about it  too    relenting 
 she offered to pay my board and share her room with me if i consented 
but i would so much rather get to work at once and be independent  do
let me do your dusting   coaxingly   i ll come every morning and put
these four rooms in nice order  and you need never let pierre or marie
or any one touch the china again  unless you like  i can almost promise
that i won   break anything  

 my dear  it would be beautiful for me  but perfectly horrid for you  i
quite agree with your cousin for once  it will never do in the world for
you to attempt such a thing  people would drop you at once  you would
lose your position and all your chance  if it was known that you were
doing that kind of work  

 but don   you see   cried georgie  kneeling down on the hearth rug to
bring her face nearer to her friend      don   you see that i ve  got 
to be dropped any way  not because i have done anything  not because
people are unkind  but just from the necessity of things  i have no
money to buy dresses to go out and enjoy myself with  i have no money to
stay at home on  in fact   i  must  do something  and to live like
cousin vi on the edge of things  just tolerated by people  and mortified
and snubbed  and then have a little crumb of pleasure tossed to me  as
one throws the last scrap of cake that one doesn   want to a cat or a
dog    that  is what i could not possibly bear 

 i like fun and pretty things and luxury as well as other people   she
continued  after a little pause   it isn   that i shouldn    prefer 
something different  but everybody can   be well off and have things
their own way  and since i am one of the rank and file  it seems to me
much wiser to give up the things i  can    have  out and out  and not
try to be two persons at once  a young lady and a working girl  but put
my whole heart into the thing i must be  and do it just as well as i
can  don   you see that i am right  

 you poor dear darling   said mrs  st  john  with tears in her eyes 
then her face cleared 

 very well   she said briskly   you  shall   it will be the greatest
comfort in the world to have you take charge of the ornaments   now  i
can buy as many cups and saucers as i like  and with an easy mind  you
must stay and lunch  always  georgie  i ll give you a regular salary 
and when the weather   bad i shall keep you to dinner too  and to spend
the night  that   settled  and now let us decide what i shall give you 
would fifty dollars a month be enough  

 my dear mrs  st  john  fifty  two dollars a week was what i was
thinking of  

 two dollars  oh  you foolish child  you never could live on that  you
don   know anything at all about expenses  georgie  

 but i don   mean only to do  your  dusting  if you are satisfied  i
depend on your recommending me to your friends  i could take care of
four sets of rooms just as well as of one  there are so many people in
sandyport who have beautiful houses and collections of bric à brac  that
i think there might be as many as that who would care to have me if i
didn   cost too much  four places at two dollars each would make eight
dollars a week  i could live on that nicely  

 i wish you   count me in as four   said mrs  st  john   i should see
four times as much of you  and it would make me four hundred times
happier  

but georgie was firm  and before they parted it was arranged that she
should begin her new task the next morning  and that her friend should
do what she could to find her similar work elsewhere 

her plan once made  georgie suffered no grass to grow under her feet 
on the way home she bought some cheese cloth and a stiff little brush
with a pointed end for carvings  and before the next day had provided
herself with a quantity of large soft dusters and two little phials of
alcohol and oil  and had hunted up a small pair of bellows  which
experience had shown her were invaluable for blowing the dust out of
delicate objects  her first essay was a perfect success  mrs  st  john 
quite at a loss how to face the changed situation  gave her a
half troubled welcome  but georgie   business like methods reassured
her  she followed her about and watched her handle each fragile treasure
with skilful  delicate fingers till all was in perfect fresh order  and
gave a great sigh of admiration and relief when the work was done 

 now come and sit down   she said   how tired you must be  

 not a bit   declared georgie   i like to dust  strange to say  and i  
not tired at all  i only wish i had another job just like it to do at
once  i see it   what i was made for  

by the end of the week georgie had another regular engagement  and it
became necessary to break the news of her new occupation to cousin vi 
i regret to say that the disclosure caused an  unpleasantness   between
them 

 i would not have believed such a thing possible even with you  
declared that lady with angry tears   the very idea marks you out as a
person of low mind  it   enough to make your grandmother talcott rise
from her grave  in the name of common decency  couldn   you hunt up
something to do  if do you must  except this  

 nothing that i could do so well and so easily  cousin vi  

 don   call me cousin vi  i beg  there was no need of doing anything
whatever  i asked you to stay here   you cannot deny that i did  

 i don   wish to deny it   said georgie  gently   it was ever so kind of
you  too  don   be so vexed with me  cousin vi  we look at things
differently  and i don   suppose either of us can help it  but don   let
us quarrel  you re almost the only relative that i have in the world  

 quarrel   cried miss talcott with a shrill laugh    quarrel with a girl
that goes out dusting  that isn   in my line  i am happy to say  as for
being relatives  we are so no longer  and i shall say so to everybody 
great heavens  what will people think  

after this outburst it was evident to georgie that it was better that
she should leave miss sally   as soon as possible  but where to go  she
consulted miss sally  that astute person comprehended the situation in
the twinkling of an eye  and was ready with a happy suggestion 

 there   my brother john   widder in the lower street   she said   she  
tolerably well off  and hasn   ever taken boarders  but she   a sort of
lonesome person  and i shouldn   wonder if i could fix it so she   feel
like taking you  and reasonable too  it   mighty handy about that
furniture of yours  for her upstairs rooms ain   got nothing in them to
speak of  and of course she wouldn   want to buy  i ll step down after
dinner and see about it  

miss sally was a power in her family circle  and she knew it  before
night she had talked mrs  john scannell into the belief that to take
georgie to board at five dollars a week was the thing of all others that
she most wanted to do  and before the end of two days all was arranged 
and georgie inducted into her new quarters  it was a little low pitched 
old fashioned house  but it had some pleasant features  and was very
neat  a big corner room with a window to the south and another to the
sunset was assigned to georgie for her bedroom  the old furniture that
she had been used to all her life made it look homelike  and the
hair cloth sofa and the secretary and square mahogany table were welcome
additions to the rather scantily furnished sitting room below  which she
shared at will with her hostess  mrs  scannell was a gentle  kindly
woman  the soul of cleanliness and propriety  but subject to low
spirits  and contact with georgie   bright  hopeful youth was as
delightful to her as it was beneficial  she soon became very fond of  my
young lady   as she called her  and georgie could not have been better
placed as to kindness and comfortableness 

a better place than sandyport for just such an experiment as she was
making could scarcely have been found  many city people made it their
home for the summer  but at all times of the year there was a
considerable resident population of wealthy people  luxurious homes were
rather the rule than the exception  and there was quite a little
rivalry as to elegance of appointment among them  mrs  st  john  
enthusiasm and mrs  st  john   recommendation bore fruit  and it was not
long before georgie had secured her coveted  four places  

two of her employers were comparative strangers  with the fourth  mrs 
constant carrington  she had been on terms of some intimacy in the old
days  but was not much so now  it  is  rather difficult to keep up
friendship with your  dusting girl   as her cousin vi would have said 
mrs  carrington called her  georgie  still  when they met  and was
perfectly civil in her manners  but always there was the business
relation to stand between them  and georgie felt it  mrs  st  john still
tried to retain the pretty pretext that georgie   labors were a sort of
joke  a playing with independence  but there was nothing of this pretext
with the other three  to them  georgie was simply a useful adjunct to
their luxurious lives  as little to be regarded as the florist who
filled their flower boxes or the man who tuned their pianos 

these little rubs to self complacency were not very hard to bear  it was
not exactly pleasant  certainly  to pass in at the side entrance where
she had once been welcomed at the front door  to feel that her comings
and her goings were so insignificant as to be scarcely noticed  now and
then  perhaps  to be treated with scant courtesy by an ill mannered
servant  this rarely chanced  however  georgie had a little natural
dignity which impressed servants as well as other people  and from her
employers she received nothing but the most civil treatment  fashion is
not unkindly  and it was still remembered that miss talcott was born a
lady  though she worked for a living  there were stormy days and dull
days  days when georgie felt tired and discouraged  or  harder still to
bear  bright days and gala days  when she saw other girls of her age
setting forth to enjoy themselves in ways now closed to her  i will not
deny that she suffered at such moments  and wished with all her heart
that things could be different  but on the whole she bore herself
bravely and well  and found some happiness in her work  together with a
great deal of contentment 

mrs  st  john added to her difficulties by continual efforts to tempt
her to do this and that pleasant thing which georgie felt to be
inexpedient  she wanted her favorite to play at young ladyhood in her
odd minutes  and defy the little frosts and chills which georgie
instinctively knew would be her portion if she should attempt to enter
society again on the old terms  if georgie urged that she had no proper
dress  the answer was prompt    my dear  i am going to give you a
dress   or   my dear  you can wear my blue  we are just the same
height   but georgie stood firm  warded off the shower of gifts which
was ready to descend upon her  and loving her friend the more that she
was so foolishly kind  would not let herself be persuaded into doing
what she knew was unwise 

 i can   be two people at once   she persisted   there   not enough of
me for that  you remember what i said that first day  and i mean to
stick to it  you are a perfect darling  and just as kind as you can be 
but you must just let me go my own way  dear mrs  st  john  and be
satisfied to know that it is the comfort of my life to have you love me
so much  though i won   go to balls with you  

but though georgie would not go to balls or dinner parties  there were
smaller gayeties and pleasures which she did not refuse   drives and
sails now and then  tickets to concerts and lectures  or a long quiet
sunday with a  spend the night  to follow  these little breaks in her
busy life were wholesome and refreshing  and she saw no reason for
denying them to herself  there was nothing morbid in my little knight of
labor  which was one reason why she labored so successfully 

so the summer came and went  and georgie with it  keeping steadily on at
her daily task  all that she found to do she did as thoroughly and as
carefully as she knew how  she was of real use  and she knew it  her
work had a value  it was not imaginary work  invented as a pretext for
giving her help  and the fact supported her self respect 

we are told in one of our lord   most subtly beautiful parables  that to
them who make perfect use of their one talent  other talents shall be
added also  many faithful workers have proved the meaning and the truth
of the parable  and georgie talcott found it now among the rest  with
the coming in of the autumn another sphere of activity was suddenly
opened to her  it sprang  as good things often do  from a seeming
disappointment 

she was drawing on her gloves one morning at the close of her labors 
when a message was brought by the discreet english butler 

 mrs  parish says  miss  will you be so good as to step up to her
morning room before you go  

 certainly  frederick   and georgie turned and ran lightly upstairs 
mrs  parish was sitting at her writing table with rather a preoccupied
face 

 i sent for you  miss talcott  because i wanted to mention that we are
going abroad for the winter   she began   maud isn   well  the doctors
recommend the riviera  so we have decided rather suddenly on our plans 
and are to sail on the  scythia  the first of november  we shall be gone
a year  

 dear me   thought georgie   there   another of my places lost  it is
quite dreadful   she was conscious of a sharp pang of inward
disappointment 

 my cousin  mrs  ernest stockton  is to take the place   continued mrs 
parish   her husband has been in the legation at paris  you know  for
the last six years  but now they are coming back for good  and when i
telegraphed her of our decision  she at once cabled to secure this
house  they will land the week after we sail  and i suppose will want
to come up at once  now  of course all sorts of things have got to be
done to make ready for them  but it   out of the question that i should
do them  for what with packing and the children   dressmaking and
appointments at the dentist   and all that  my hands are so full that i
could not possibly undertake anything else  so i was thinking of you 
you have so much head and system  you know  and i could trust you as i
could not any stranger  and you know the house so well  and you could
get plenty of people to help  so that it need not be burdensome  there
will be some things to be packed away  and the whole place to be
cleaned  floors waxed and curtains washed  the duchesse dressing tables
taken to pieces and done up and fluted   all that sort of thing  you
know  oh  and there would be an inventory to make  too  i forgot that 
then next year i should want it gone over again in the same way   the
articles that are packed taken out and put into place  and so on  that
it may look natural when we come home  my idea would be to move the
family down to new york on the 15th  so as to give you a clear
fortnight  and just come up for one day before we sail  for a final
look  of course i should leave the keys in your charge  and i should
want you to take the whole responsibility  now  will you do it  and just
tell me what you will ask for it all  

 may i think it over for one night   said prudent georgie   i will come
to morrow morning with my answer  

she thought it over carefully  and seemed to see that here was a new
vista of remunerative labor opened to her  of a more permanent character
than mere dusting  so she signified to mrs  parish that she would
undertake the job  and having done so  bent her mind to doing it in the
best possible manner  she made careful lists  and personally
superintended each detail  miss sally recommended trustworthy
workpeople  and everything was carried out to the full satisfaction of
mrs  parish  who could not say enough in praise of georgie and her
methods 

 it robs going to europe of half its terrors to have such a person to
turn to   she told her friends   that little miss talcott is really
wonderful   so clear headed and exact  it   really extraordinary where
she learned it all  such a girl as she is  if any of you are going
abroad  you ll find her the greatest comfort possible  

these commendations bore fruit  people in sandyport were always setting
forth for this part of the world or that  and leaving houses behind
them  a second job of the same sort was soon urged upon georgie 
followed by a third and a fourth  it was profitable work  for she had
fifty dollars in each case  a hundred for her double job at the algernon
parishes    so her year   expenses were assured  and she was not sorry
when another of her  dusting  families went to florida for the winter 

it became the fashion in sandyport to employ  little miss talcott   her
capabilities once discovered  people were quick in finding out ways in
which to utilize them  mrs  robert brown had the sudden happy thought of
getting georgie to arrange the flowers for a ball which she was giving 
georgie loved flowers  and had that knack of making them look charming
in vases which is the gift of a favored few  the ball decorations were
admired and commented upon  people said it was  so clever of mrs 
brown   and  so much better than stiff things from a florist     and
presently half a dozen other ladies wanted the same thing done for
them  fashion and sheep always follow any leader who is venturesome
enough to try a new fence 

later  mrs  horace brown  with her cards out for a great lawn party  had
the misfortune to sprain her ankle  in this emergency she bethought
herself of georgie  who thereupon proved so  invaluable  as a  dea ex
machina  behind the scenes  that thenceforward mrs  brown never felt
that she could give any sort of entertainment without her help 
engagements thickened  and georgie   hands became so full that she
laughingly threatened to  take a partner  

 that   just what i always wanted you to do   said mrs  st  john    a
real nice one  with heaps of money  who would take you about everywhere 
and give you a good time  

 oh  that   not at all the sort i want   protested georgie  laughing and
blushing   i mean a real business partner  a fellow sweeperess and
house arranger and ball supper manageress  

 wretched girl  how horribly practical you are  i wish i could see you
discontented and sentimental just for once  

 heaven forbid  that  would  be a pretty state of things  now good by  i
have about half a ton of roses to arrange for mrs  lauriston  

 oh   for her dance  georgie   coaxingly   why not go for once with me 
come  just this once  there   that white dress of mine from  pingat  
with the  point de venie  sleeves  that would exactly fit you  

 nonsense   replied georgie  briefly  she kissed her friend and hurried
away 

 i declare   soliloquized mrs  st  john  looking after her   i could
find it in my heart to  advertise  for some one to come and rescue
georgie talcott from all this hard work  what nice old times those were
when you had only to get up a tournament and blow a trumpet or two  and
have true knights flock in from all points of the compass in aid of
distressed damsels  i wish such things were in fashion now  i would buy
a trumpet this very day  i vow  and have a tournament next week  

georgie   true knight  as it happened  was to come from a quarter little
suspected by mrs  st  john  for the spare afternoons of this second
winter georgie had reserved rather a large piece of work  which had
the advantage that it could be taken up at will and laid down when
convenient  this was the cataloguing of a valuable library belonging to
mr  constant carrington  that gentleman had observed georgie rather
closely as she went about her various avocations  and had formed so high
an opinion of what he was pleased to term her  executive ability   that
he made a high bid for her services in preference to those of any one
else 

 illustration  recognizing an old friend  she jumped up  exclaiming 
 why bob  mr  curtis  how do you do     page 49   

she was sitting in this library one rainy day in january  beside a big
packing case  with a long row of books on the table  which she was
dusting  classifying  and noting on the list in her lap  when the door
opened and a tall young man came in  georgie glanced at him vaguely  as
at a stranger  then recognizing an old friend  she jumped up 
exclaiming   why bob  mr  curtis   how do you do  i had no idea that you
were here  

bob curtis looked bewildered  he had reached sandyport only that
morning  no one had chanced to mention georgie or the change in her
fortunes  and for a moment he failed to recognize in the white aproned 
dusty fingered vision before him the girl whom he had known so well five
years previously 

 it is   why it  is    he exclaimed   miss georgie  how delighted i am
to see you  i was coming down to call as soon as i could find out where
you were  my aunt said nothing about your being in the house  

 very likely she did not know  i am in and out so often here that i do
not always see mrs  carrington  

 indeed   bob looked more puzzled than ever  he had not remembered that
there was any such close intimacy in the old days between the two
families 

 i can   shake hands  i am too dusty   went on georgie   but i am very
glad indeed to see you again  

she too was taking mental notes  and observing that her former friend
had lost somewhat of the gloss and brilliance of his boyish days  that
his coat was not of the last cut  and that his expression was
spiritless  not to say discontented   poor fellow   she thought 

 what on earth does it all mean   meditated bob on his part 

 these books only came yesterday   said georgie  indicating the big box
with a wave of the hand 

 i have had to dust them all  and i find that italian dust sticks just
as the american variety does  and makes the fingers just as black   a
little laugh 

 what  are  you doing  if i may be so bold as to ask  

 cataloguing your uncle   library  he has been buying quantities of
books for the last two years  as perhaps you know  he has a man in
germany and another in paris and another in london  who purchase for
him  and the boxes are coming over almost every week now  a great case
full of the english ones arrived last saturday   such beauties  look at
that ruskin behind you  it is the first edition  with all the plates 
worth its weight in gold  

 it   awfully good of you to take so much trouble  i   sure   remarked
mr  curtis politely  still with the same mystified look 

 not at all   replied georgie  coolly   it   all in my line of business 
you know  mr  carrington is to give me a hundred dollars for the job 
which is excellent pay  because i can take my own time for doing it  and
work at odd moments  

her interlocutor looked more perplexed than ever  a distinct
embarrassment became visible in his manner at the words  job  and  pay  

 certainly   he said  then coloring a little he frankly went on   i
don   understand a bit  would you mind telling me what it all means  

 oh  you haven   happened to hear of my  befalments   as miss sally
scannell would call them  

 i did hear of your mother   death   said bob  gently   and i was truly
sorry  she was so kind to me always in the old days  

 she was kind to everybody  i am glad you were sorry   said georgie 
bright tears in the eyes which she turned with a grateful look on bob 
 well  that was the beginning of it all  

there was another pause  during which bob pulled his moustache
nervously  then he drew a chair to the table and sat down 

 can you talk while you re working   he asked   and mayn   i help  it
seems as though i might at least lift those books out for you  now  if
you don   mind  if it isn   painful  won   you tell me what has happened
to you  for i see that something  has  happened  

 a great deal has happened  but it isn   painful to tell about it 
things  were  puzzling at first  but they have turned out wonderfully 
and i   rather proud of the way they have gone  

so  little by little  with occasional interruptions for lifting out
books and jotting down titles  she told her story  won from point to
point by the eager interest which her companion showed in the narrative 
when she had finished  he brought his hand down heavily on the table 

 i ll tell you what   he exclaimed with vigorous emphasis   it   most
extraordinary that a girl should do as you have done  you re an absolute
little  brick    if you ll excuse the phrase  but it makes a fellow  it
makes  me  more ashamed of myself than i ve often been in my life
before  

 but why   why should you be ashamed  

 oh  i ve been having hard times too   explained bob  gloomily   but i
haven   been so plucky as you  i ve minded them more  

georgie knew vaguely something of these  hard times   in the  old days  
five years before  when she was seventeen and he a harvard junior of
twenty  spending a long vacation with his uncle  and when they had
rowed and danced and played tennis together so constantly as to set
people to wondering if anything  serious  was likely to arise from the
intimacy  the world with all its opportunities and pleasures seemed open
to the heir of the curtis family  bob   father was rich  the family
influential  there seemed nothing that he might not command at will 

then all was changed suddenly  a great financial panic swept away the
family fortunes in a few weeks  mr  curtis died insolvent  and robert
was called on to give up many half formed wishes and ambitions  and face
the stern realities  what little could be saved from the wreck made a
scanty subsistence for his mother and sisters  he must support himself 
for more than two years he had been filling a subordinate position in a
large manufacturing business  his friends considered him in luck to
secure such a place  and he was fain to agree with them  but the
acknowledgment did not make him exactly happy in it  notwithstanding 

discipline can hardly be agreeable  bob curtis had been a little spoiled
by prosperity  and though he did his work fairly well  there was always
a bitterness at heart  and a certain tinge of false shame at having it
to do at all  he worked because he must  he told himself  not because he
liked or ever should like it  all the family traditions were opposed to
work  then he had the natural confidence of a very young man in his own
powers  and it was not pleasant to be made to feel at every turn that he
was raw  inexperienced  not particularly valuable to anybody  and that
no one especially looked up to or admired him  he scorned himself for
minding such things  but all the same he did mind them  and the frank 
kindly young fellow was in danger of becoming soured and cynical in his
lonely and uncongenial surroundings 

it was just at this point that good fortune brought him into contact
with georgie talcott  and it was like the lifting of a veil from before
his eyes  he recollected her such a pretty  care free creature  petted
and adored by her mother  every day filled with pleasant things  not a
worry or cloud allowed to shadow the bright succession of her
amusements  and here she sat telling him of a fight with necessity
compared with which his seemed like child   play  and out of which she
had come victorious  he was struck  too  with the total absence of
embarrassment and false shame in the telling  work  in georgie   mind 
was evidently a thing to be proud of and thankful over  not something to
be practised shyly  and alluded to with bated breath  the contrast
between his and her way of looking at the thing struck him sharply 

it did not take long for georgie to arrive at the facts in bob   case 
confidence begets confidence  and in another day or two  won by her
bright sympathy  he gradually made a clean breast of his troubles 
somehow they did not seem so great after they were told  georgie  
sympathy was not of a weakening sort  and her questions and comments
seemed to clear things to his mind  and set them in right relations to
each other 

 i don   think that i pity you much   she told him one day   your mother
and the girls  yes  because they are women and not used to it  and it
always  is  harder for girls   

 see here  you re a girl yourself   put in bob 

 no  i   a business person  don   interrupt  what i was going to say
was  that i think it    lovely  for a young man to have to work  we are
all lazy by nature  we need to be shaken up and compelled to do our
best  you will be ten times as much of a person in the end as if you had
always had your own way  

 do you really think that  but what   the use of talking  i may stick
where i am for years  and never do more than just make a living  

 i wouldn     said georgie  throwing back her pretty head with an air of
decision   i should scorn to  stick  if i were a man  and i don  
believe you will either  if you once go into it heartily and put your
will into it  you re sure to succeed  i always considered you clever 
you know  you ll go up  up  as sure as  as sure as  dust    that   the
thing of all the world that   most certain to rise  i think  

  overmastered with a clod of valiant marl    muttered robert below his
breath  then aloud   well  if that   the view you take of it  i ll do my
best to prove you right  it   worth a good deal to know that there is
somebody who expects something of me  

 i expect everything of you   said georgie confidently  and bob went
back to his post at the end of the fortnight infinitely cheered and
heartened 

 bless her brave little heart   he said to himself   i won   disappoint
her if i can help it  or  if i must  i ll know the reason why  

it is curious  and perhaps a little humiliating  to realize how much our
lives are affected by what may be called accident  a touch here or
there  a little pull up or down to set us going  often determines the
direction in which we go  and direction means all  robert curtis in
after times always dated the beginning of his fortunes from the day when
he walked into his uncle   library and found georgie talcott cataloguing
books 

 it set me to making a man of myself   he used to say 

georgie did not see him for more than a year after his departure  but he
wrote twice to say that he had taken her advice and it had  worked   and
he had  got a rise   the truth was that the boy had an undeveloped
capacity for affairs  inherited from the able old grandfather  who laid
the foundations of the fortune which bob   father muddled away  when
once will and energy were roused and brought into play  this hereditary
bent asserted itself  bob became valuable to his employers  and like
georgie    dust   began to go up in the business scale 

georgie had just successfully re established the algernon parishes  who
arrived five months later than was expected  in their home  when bob
came up for a second visit to his uncle  this time he had three weeks 
leave  and it was just before he went back that he proposed the
formation of what he was pleased to call  a labor union  

 you see i   a working man now just as you are a working woman   he
explained   it   our plain duty to co operate  you shall be grand
master  or rather mistress  and i ll be some sort of a subordinate   a
walking delegate  perhaps  

 indeed  you shall be nothing of the sort  walking delegates are
particularly idle people  i ve always heard  they just go about ordering
other folks to stop work and do nothing  

 then i won   be one  i ll be grand master   mate  

 there   no such office in labor unions  if we have one at all  you must
have the first place in it  

 what is that position  please describe it in full  whatever happens  i
won   strike  

 oh   said georgie  with the prettiest blush in the world   the position
is too intricate for explanation  we won   describe it  

 but will you join the union  

 i thought we had joined already   both of us  

 now  georgie  dearest  i   in earnest  thanks to you  i know what work
means and how good it is  and now i want my reward  which is to work
beside you always as long as i live  don   turn away your head  but tell
me that i may  

i cannot tell you exactly what was georgie   answer  for this
conversation took place on the beach  and just then they sat down on the
edge of a boat and began to talk in such low tones that no one could
overhear  but as they sat a long time and she went home leaning
contentedly on bob   arm  i presume she answered as he wished  he went
back to his work soon afterward  and has made his way up very fast
since  next spring the firm with which he is connected propose to send
him to chicago to start a new branch of their business there  he is to
have a good salary and a share of the profits  and it is understood that
georgie will go with him  she has kept on steadily at her various
avocations  has made herself so increasingly useful that all sandyport
wonders what it shall do without her when she goes away  and has laid up
what miss sally calls  a tidy bit of money  toward the furnishing of the
home which she and bob hope to have before long  mrs  st  john has many
plans in mind for the wedding  and though georgie laughingly protests
that she means to be married in a white apron  with a wreath of  dusty
miller  round her head  i dare say she will give in when the time comes 
and consent to let her little occasion be made pretty  even a girl who
works likes to have her marriage day a bright one 

cousin vi  for her part  is dimly reaching out toward a reconciliation 
for  be it known  work which brings success  and is proved to have a
solid money value of its own  loses in the estimation of the fastidious
its degrading qualities  and is spoken of by the more euphonious title
of  good fortune   it is only work which doesn   succeed  which remains
forever disrespectable  i think i may venture to predict that the time
will come when cousin vi will condone all georgie   wrong doings  and
extend  not the olive branch only  but both hands  to  the curtises  
that is if they turn out as prosperous as their friends predict and
expect them to be 

but whatever fate may have in store for my dear little georgie and her
chosen co worker  of one thing i am sure   that  fare as they may with
worldly fortune  they will never be content  having tasted of the salt
of work  to feed again on the honey bread of idleness  or become drones
in the working hive  but will persevere to the end in the principles and
practices of what in the best sense of the word may be called their
labor union 




snowy peter 


the weather was very cold  though it was not christmas yet  and to the
great delight of the kane children  december had brought an early and
heavy fall of snow  older people were sorry  they grieved for the swift
vanishing of the lovely indian summer  for the blighting of the last
flowers  chrysanthemums  snow berries  bitter sweet  and for the red
leaves  so pretty but a few days since  which were now blown about and
battered by the strong wind  but the children wasted no sympathy on
either leaves or berries  a snow storm seemed to them just then better
than anything that ever grew on bush or tree  and they revelled in it
all the long afternoon without a thought of what it had cost the world 

it was a deep snow  it lay over the lawn six inches on a level  in the
hollow by the fence the drifts were at least two feet deep  there was
no lack of building material therefore when reggie proposed that they
should all go to work and make a fort 

such a wonderful fort as it turned out to be  it had walls and bastions
and holes for cannon  it had cannon too  all made of snow  it had a
gateway  just like a real fort  and a flag staff and a flag  the staff
was a tall slender column of snow  and they poured water over it  and it
froze and became a long pole of glittering ice  the flag had a
swallow tail and was icy too  reggie had been in new london and newport
the last summer  he had seen real fortifications and knew how they
should look  under his direction the little ones built a  glacis   some
of you will know what that is   the steep slippery grass slope which
lies beneath the fort walls and is so hard to climb  this  glacis  was
harder yet  snow is better than grass for defensive purposes  if only it
would last 

 now let   make the soldiers   shouted little paul as the last
shovel full of snow was spread on the  glacis  and smoothed down 

 oh  paul  we can    there won   be time   said elma  the biggest girl 
glancing apprehensively at the sun  which was nearing the edge of the
sky   it must be five o clock  and nurse will call us almost right
away  

 oh  bother  i wish the days weren   so short   said paul
discontentedly   let   make one man  any way  just for a sentry  you
know  there ought to be a sentry to take care of the fort  can   we 
elma  

 yes  only we must hurry  

the small crew precipitated itself on the drift  none of them were cold 
for exercise had warmed their blood  the little ones gathered great
snowballs and rolled them up to the fort  while the big ones shaped and
moulded  in a wonderfully short time the  man  was completed   eyes 
nose  and all  and the gun in his hand  a pipe was put into his mouth  a
cocked hat on his head  elma curled his hair a little  susan sunflower 
as the round faced younger girl was called for fun  patted and smoothed
his cheeks and forehead with her warm little hands  they made boots for
him  and a coat with buttons on the tail pocket  he was a beautiful man
indeed  just as the last touch was given  a window opened and nurse  
head appeared   the very thing the children had been dreading 

 come  children  come in to supper   she called out across the snow 
 it   nearly half past five  you ought to have come in half an hour ago 
miss susan  stop working in that snow  nasty cold stuff  you ll catch
your death  master reggie  make the little boys hurry  please  

there was never any appeal from nurse freeman   decisions  least of all
now when papa and mamma were both away  and she ruled the house as its
undisputed autocrat  even reggie  on the verge of twelve  dare not
disobey her  she was english and a martinet  and had been in charge of
the children all their lives  but she was kind as well as strict  and
they loved her  reluctantly the little troop prepared to go  they picked
up the shovels and baskets  for nurse freeman was very particular about
fetching things in and putting them in their places  they took a last
regretful look at their fort  paul climbed the wall for one more jump
down  little harry indulged in a final slide across the  glacis   susan
sunflower stroked the sentinel   hand   good night  snowy peter   they
cried in chorus  for that was the name they had agreed upon for their
soldier  then they ran across the lawn in a long skurrying line like a
covey of birds  there was a scraping of feet on the porch  the side door
closed with a bang  and they were gone 

left to himself  snowy peter stood still in his place beside the gateway
of the fortification  snowmen usually do stand still  at least till the
time comes for them to melt and run away  so there was nothing strange
in that  what  was  singular was that about an hour after the children
had left him  when dusk had closed in over the house and the leafless
trees  and  fort kane  had grown a vague dim shape  he slowly turned his
head  it was as though the fingers of little susan had communicated
something of their warmth and fulness of life to the poor senseless
figure while working over it  and this influence was beginning to take
effect  he turned his head and looked in the direction of the house  all
was dark except for the hall lamp below  which shone through the glass
panes above the door  and for two windows in the second story out of
which streamed a strong yellow light  these were the windows of the
nursery  where  at that moment  the children were eating their supper 

snowy peter remained for a time in motionless silence looking at the
window  then his body slowly began to turn  following the movement of
its head  he lifted one stiff ill shaped foot and moved a step forward 
then he lifted the other and took another step  his left arm dangled
uselessly  the right hand held out the gun which paul had made  and
which was of the most curious shape  the tracks which he left in the
snow as he crossed the lawn resembled the odd  waddling tracks of a
flat footed elephant as much as anything else 

it took him a long  long time to cross the space over which the light
feet of the children had run in two minutes  each step seemed to cost
him a mighty effort  the right leg would quiver for a moment  then wave
wildly to and fro  then with a sort of galvanic jerk project itself  and
the whole body  with a pitch and a lurch  would plunge forward heavily 
till brought up again in an upright position by the advanced leg  after
that the left leg would take its turn  and the process be repeated 
there was no spring  no supple play to the joints  in fact  snowy peter
had no joints  his young creators had left them out while constructing
him 

at last he reached the wall of the house  and stood beneath the windows
where the yellow light was burning  this had been the goal of his
desires  but  alas  now that he had attained the coveted position he
could not look in at the windows  he was far too short  desperation lent
him energy  a stout lattice was nailed against the house  up which in
summer a flowering clematis twined and clustered  seizing this  snowy
peter began to climb 

up one bar after another he slowly and painfully went  lifting his heavy
feet and clinging tightly with his poor  stiff hands  his gun stock
snapped in the middle  his cocked hat sustained many contusions  even
his nose had more than one hard knock  but he had the heart of a hero 
whom neither danger  nor difficulty  nor personal inconvenience can
deter  and at last his head was on a level with the nursery window sill 

it was a pleasant sight that met his eyes  no one had slept in the
nursery since paul had grown big enough for a bed of his own  and though
it kept its own name  it was in reality only a big  cheerful upstairs
sitting room  where lessons could be studied  meals taken  and nurse
freeman sit and do her mending and be on hand always for any one who
wanted her  now that mr  and mrs  kane were absent  the downstairs rooms
looked vacant and dreary  and the children spent all their evenings in
the nursery from preference  a large fire burned briskly in the ample
grate  a kettle hissed and bubbled on the hob  on the round table where
the lamp stood  was a row of bright little tin basins just emptied of
the smoking hot bread and milk which was the usual nursery supper  nurse
was cutting slices from a big brown loaf and buttering them with nice
yellow butter  there was also some gingerbread  and by way of special
and particular treat  a pot of strawberry jam  to which paul at that
moment was paying attention 

he had scooped out such an enormous spoonful as to attract the notice of
the whole party  and just as snowy peter raised his white staring eyes
above the sill  reggie called out   hullo  i say  leave a little of that
for somebody else  will you  

 piggy wiggy   remarked harry  indignantly   and it   your second help
too  

 master paul  i   surprised at you   observed nurse freeman severely 
taking the big spoonful away from him   there  that   quite enough  
and she put half the quantity on the edge of his plate and gave the
other half to susan 

 that   not fair   remonstrated paul   when i ve been working so hard 
and it   so cold  and when i like jam so  and when it   so awfully good
beside  

 jam  what is jam   thought snowy peter  he pressed his cold nose closer
to the glass 

 we all worked hard  paul   said elma   and we all like jam as much as
you do  may i have some more  nursey  

 i wonder how poor snowy peter feels all alone out there in the garden  
said susan sunflower   he must be very cold  poor fellow  

 ho  he don   mind it   declared paul with his mouth full of
bread and jam 

 oh  yes  i do  i mind it very much   murmured snowy peter to himself 
but he had no voice with which to make an outward noise 

 won   you come out and see him to morrow  nursey   went on susan   he  
the best man we ever made  he   quite beautiful  he   got a pipe and a
hat and curly hair and buttons on his coat  i   sure you ll like him  

snowy peter reared himself straighter on the lattice  he was proud to
hear himself thus commended 

 if he could only talk and walk  he   be just as good as a live person 
really he would  nursey   said elma   wouldn   it be fun if he could 
we   bring him in to tea and he   sit by the fire and warm his hands 
and it would be such fun  

 he   melt fast enough in this warm room   observed reggie  while nurse
freeman added   that   nonsense  miss elma  how could a man like that
walk  and i don   want no nasty snow images in  my  nursery  melting and
slopping up the carpet  

snowy peter listened to this conversation with a painful feeling at his
heart  he felt lonely and forlorn  no one really liked him  to the
children he was only a thing to be played with and joked about  nurse
freeman called him a  nasty snow image   but though he was hurt and
troubled in his spirit  the warm bright nursery  the sound of laughter
and human voices  even the fire  that foe most fatal of all to things
made of snow  had an irresistible attraction for him  he could not bear
the idea of returning to his cold post of duty beside the lonely fort 
and under the wintry midnight sky  so he still clung to the lattice and
looked in at the window with his unwinking eyes  and a great longing to
be inside  and to sit down by the cheerful fire and be treated with
kindness  took possession of him  but what is the use of such ambitions
to a snow man 

long  long he clung to the lattice and lingered and looked in  he saw
the two little ones when first the sand man began to drop his grains
into their eyes  and noticed how they struggled against the sleepy
influence  and tried to keep awake  he saw nurse freeman carry them off 
and presently fetch them back in their flannel nightgowns to say their
prayers beside the fire  snowy peter did not know what it meant as they
knelt with their heads in nursey   lap  and their pink toes curled up in
the glow of the heat  but it was a pretty sight to see  and he liked it 

after they were taken away for the second time  he watched elma as she
studied her geography lesson for the morrow  while reggie did sums on
his slate  and paul played at checkers with susan sunflower  snowy peter
thought he should like to do sums  and he was sure it would be nice to
play checkers  and jump squares and chuckle and finally beat  as paul
did  alas  checkers are not for snow men  paul went to bed when the game
was ended  and susan  and a little later the other two followed  then
nurse freeman raked out the fire and put ashes on top  and blew the
lights out and went away herself  leaving the nursery dark and silent
except for a dim glow from the ash smothered grate and the low ticking
of the clock 

some time after she departed  when the lights in the other windows had
all been extinguished and the house was as dark inside as the night was
outside  snowy peter raised his hand and pushed gently at the sash  it
was not fastened  and it opened easily and without much noise  then a
heavy leg was thrown over the sill  and stiffly and painfully the snow
soldier climbed into the room  he wanted to feel what it was like to sit
in a chair beside a table as human beings sit  and he was extremely
curious about the fire 

alas  he could not sit  he was made to stand but not to bend  when he
tried to seat himself his body lay in a long inclined plane  with the
shoulder blades resting on the back of the chair  and the legs sticking
out straight before him   an attitude which was not at all comfortable 
the chair creaked beneath him and tipped dangerously  it was with
difficulty that he got again into his natural position  and he trembled
with fear in every limb  it had been a narrow escape   a fine thing it
would have been if i had fallen over and not been able to get on my feet
again   he thought   how that terrible old woman would have swept me up
in the morning   then  cautiously and timidly  he put his finger into
the nearly empty jam pot  rubbed it round till a little of the sweet 
sticky juice adhered to it  and raised it to his lips  it had no taste
to him  jam was a human joy in which he could not share  and he heaved a
deep sigh 

drops began to stand on his forehead  though there was so little fire
left  the room was much warmer than the outer air  and snowy peter had
begun to melt  a great and sudden fear took possession of him  as fast
as his heavy limbs would allow  he hastened to the window  it was a
great deal harder to go down the lattice than to climb up it  and twice
he almost lost his footing  but at last he stood safely on the ground 
the window he left open  he had no strength left for extra exertion 

with increasing difficulty he stumbled across the lawn to his old
position beside the gateway of the fort  a sense of duty had sustained
him thus far  for a sentry must be found at his post  but now that he
was there  all power seemed to desert his limbs  little susan   warm
fingers had perhaps put just so much life into him  and no more  as
would enable him to do what he had done  as a clock can run but its
appointed course of hours and must then stop  his head turned no longer
in the direction of the house  his eyes looked immovably forward  the
straight stiff hand held out the broken gun  two o clock sounded from
the church steeple  three  four  the earliest dawn crept slowly into the
sky  it broadened to a soft pink flush  a sudden wind rose and stirred 
and as if quickened by its impulse up came the yellow sun  smoke began
to curl from the house chimneys  doors opened  voices sounded  but still
snowy peter did not move 

 why  what is this   cried nurse freeman  hurrying into the nursery from
her bedroom  which was near   how comes this window to be open  i left
the fire covered up a purpose  that my dears might have a warm room to
breakfast in  it   as cold as a barn  it must be that careless maria 
she   no head and no thoughtfulness  that girl  

maria denied the accusation  but nurse was not convinced   windows did
not open without hands   she justly observed  but what hands opened this
particular window nurse freeman never  never knew 

presently another phenomenon claimed her attention  there on the carpet 
close to the table where the jam pot stood  was a large slop of water 
it marked the spot where the snow man had begun to melt the night
before 

 it   the snow the children brought in on their boots   suggested maria 

 boots   cried nurse freeman incredulously   boots  when i changed them
myself and put on their warm slippers   she shook her head portentously
as she wiped up the slop   there   something  on accountable in it all  
she said  so there was  but it was a great deal more unaccountable than
nurse freeman suspected 

when the children ran out  after lessons  to play in their fort  their
time for wonderment came  how oddly snowy peter looked   not at all as
he did the day before  his figure had somehow grown rubbed and shabby 
the buttons were gone from his coat tails  the gun they had taken such
pains with was broken in two   where was the other half   

 what   that on his finger   demanded elma   it looks as if it were
bleeding  

it was the juice of the strawberry jam  paul first tasted delicately
with the tip of his tongue  then he boldly bit the finger off and
swallowed it 

 why  what made you do that   asked the others 

 jam   was the succinct reply 

 jam  impossible  how could our snow man get at any jam  it couldn   be
that  

 tastes like it  any way   remarked paul 

 i can   think what has happened to spoil him so   said elma 
plaintively   do you think a loose horse can have got into the yard
during the night  see how the snow is trampled down  

 hallo  look here   shouted reggie   this is the queerest thing yet 
there   the other half the gun sticking out half way up the clematis
frame  

 it must have been a horse   said elma  who having once settled on the
idea found it hard to give it up   it couldn   be anything else  

 oh  yes  it could  it was no horse  it was me   said snowy peter in the
depths of his being  where a little warmth still lingered 

 he   very ugly now  i think  see how he   melted all along his
shoulder  and his hair has got out of curl  and his nose is awful  
pronounced susan sunflower   let   pull him to pieces and make a nicer
man  

 oh  oh   groaned snowy peter  with a final effort of consciousness  his
inward sufferings did not affect his features in the least  and no one
suspected that he was feeling anything  paul knocked the pipe out of his
mouth with a snow ball  harry  with a great push  rolled him over  the
crisp snow parted and flew  the children hurrahed  in three minutes he
was a shapeless mass  and nobody ever knew or guessed how for a few
brief hours he had lived the life of a human being  been agitated by
hope and moved by desire  so ended snowy peter  and his sole mourner was
little susan  who remarked   after all  he  was  nice before he got
spoiled  and i wish nursey had seen him  




the do something society 


clatter  clatter  went a sewing machine in an upstairs room  as the busy
mamma of the newcombe children bent over it  guiding the long breadths
beneath the clicking needle  her eyes fixed on its glancing point  but
her thoughts very far away  after the fashion of mammas who work on
sewing machines  the slam of a door  and the sound of quick feet in the
entry below  arrested her attention 

 that is catherine  of course   she said to herself   none of the other
children bang the door in just that particular way  

the top of a rapidly ascending red hat  with a pigtail of fair hair
hanging beneath it  became visible  as mrs  newcombe glanced across to
the staircase  it  was  catherine  another moment  and she burst into
the room 

 mamma  mamma  where are you  oh  mamma  we girls have invented a
society  and we are all going to belong to it  

 who is  all   and what sort of a society is it   demanded mrs 
newcombe  by no means suspending her machine work 

 all  we six  i mean  frances and the vaughns  and the  tittering
twins   and me  we haven   any name for the society yet  but we want to
do something  

 what sort of a something  

 oh  i don   know  all sorts of somethings  but  first of all  you know
how sick minnie banister is  don   you  mamma  

 yes  

 well  the society is really gotten up for her  we want to go every
saturday  and take her presents  surprises  you know  so that she can be
sort of expecting us all the week and looking forward  don   you think
that is a good plan  mamma  

 very good  but what kind of presents were you thinking of  

 i don   know exactly  we haven   thought about that yet  something
pretty  you ll give us some money to buy them with  won   you  mamma  

 no  dear  i can   do that  

 but  mamma  

 listen  catherine  and don   pucker your forehead so  it   a bad habit
which you have taken up lately  and i want you to break yourself of it 
i cannot give you money to buy presents  not that i do not love minnie 
or am not sorry for her  but i cannot afford it  papa has his own boys
and girls to feed and clothe and educate  he cannot spare money for
things that are not necessary  even when they are kind pleasant things
like this plan of yours  

 but  mamma  little bits of things  it wouldn   take much  

 you naturally feel that there is no bottom to papa   pocket  catherine 
that he has only to put his hand in and take out what he likes  but  my
dear  that isn   true  papa cannot do it any more than you can  

 then we can   have our society   cried catherine 

her lip trembled  and her face flushed pink with the sense of
disappointment 

 i didn   say that   said her mother  smiling   have the society by all
means  and carry out your plans  that can be done without money  

 but  mamma  how can it  what do you mean  

 the how i must leave to you  set your wits to work  and you will find
out  there are plenty of ways in which to please sick people besides
buying them things  notice carefully when you are there  ask mrs 
banister  use your eyes  things will suggest themselves  what sick
people enjoy most are little surprises to vary their dull days  and the
sense that some one is loving and thinking about them  small unexpected
pleasures count for more than their worth with them  now  dear  run
away  consult with the others  and when you decide what you want to do 
come to me  and i will do what i can to help you in ways that do not
cost money  

catherine looked more hopeful  though not altogether convinced 

 i ll see what they say   she remarked thoughtfully  then  after
lingering a moment  as if in hopes of something more  she ran downstairs
again 

she found the members of the future society looking rather crestfallen 
they had all rushed home to propound their plan  and each of their
mothers in turn had raised pretty much the same objections to it which
mrs  newcombe had raised  and had not tempered their denials with any
fresh suggestions  catherine   report had  therefore  rather the effect
of raising their spirits 

 i    not  sure   said frances brooks   but it would be more fun to do
it that way than the other  don   you know how much nicer it always is
to make christmas presents than to buy them  and i thought of something
while you were talking that might do for the first saturday surprise  

 have you really  what  

 it came into my head because the other day when mary and i were there 
minnie lost her handkerchief  it had slipped under the mattress or
somewhere  and she worried about not finding it  and mrs  banister was a
good while in getting another  and i was wondering if it wouldn   be
nice to make some sort of a little case  which could lie on the bed
beside her  and hold it  

 out of birch bark   suggested mary vaughn 

 splendid  we could work little blue forget me nots on it in crewels  
suggested sue hooper 

 yes  and i have a bit of blue silk that would be just the thing for the
lining   put in ethel hooper  the second  tittering twin   sue being the
first   sister had it left over from a sofa pillow  so she gave it to
me  it is quite light  and will match the forget me nots  

 now  isn   that delightful   cried catherine   here   our first
surprise all settled without any trouble at all  i know where we can get
the bark   from one of those big birches in mr  swayne   woods  and
mother ll give us some orris root for a  sachet   i know  she has some
that   particularly nice  it came from philadelphia  

under these promising auspices the  do something society   for that was
the name resolved upon  came into existence  many hands made light work
of the little handkerchief case  all the members went together to get
the birch bark  which in itself was good fun  mary vaughn cut out the
case  amy  who had taken a set of lessons in kensington stitch  worked
the starry zigzag pattern  which did duty for forget me nots  upon it 
susy hooper  who was the best needlewoman of them all  lined it 
catherine made the  sachet   ethel  as youngest  was allowed to fasten
it into the case with a tiny blue bow  and they took turns in carrying
it  as they walked toward minnie   house saturday morning 

minnie had been looking forward to saturday all the week  it was the
only day when these special friends had time to come for a good long
stay with her  on other days they  ran in   but what with schools and
music lessons  and daily walks and short winter afternoons  they always
had to run out again long before she was ready to have them go  she had
been watching the clock ever since she woke  in hopes that they would
come early  nor was she disappointed  for by half past ten the bell
rang  and steps and voices were heard coming upstairs  minnie raised
herself  and held out her hands 

 o girls  how lovely  you ve all come together   she said   i ve been
wondering all the week if you would  

 you darling  how nice it is to see you  are you any better to day  
asked catherine 

then  after they had all kissed her  amy laid on the counterpane the
handkerchief case pinned up in thin white paper 

 there   something for you   cried the society  as with one voice 

it took a good while for minnie to open the parcel  for her fingers were
weak  but she would not let any one help her  when the pretty birch bark
case was revealed  she was even more pleased than her friends had hoped
she would be 

 how dear you were to make it for me   she kept repeating   i shall
never lose my handkerchiefs now  and i shall look at it when you are not
here  and it will give me the feeling that you are making me a visit  

then they explained the new society to her and asked her to join  with
the understanding that she was not to be an  active member  till she was
quite well again  and minnie agreed  and became on the spot number seven
of the do somethings  what they did not explain was their plan for the
saturdays  because mrs  newcombe had dropped this word of wisdom into
their counsels  that sick people enjoy a little pleasure which comes
unexpectedly  much more than a larger one which they lie and think about
till they are tired of the idea of it  catherine had to bite her nimble
tongue more than once to hold the secret in  but the eyes of the others
held her in check  and she remembered in time  and while they chattered
and laughed  mary vaughn kept her eyes open as mrs  newcombe had
advised  and with such good effect that  as the society trooped out on
to the sidewalk  she was ready to say   girls  i have thought of
something for next time  

 and so have i   added frances 

 not really  what fun  tell us what yours is  

 a wall basket full of dried leaves and things to fill up that bare
space of wall opposite minnie   bed  it needn   cost anything  for i
have got one of those big japanese cuffs made of straw which will do for
the basket  and there are thousands of leaves to be had for the
picking  

 what a good idea that is   said amy vaughn   we will make it lovely 
and it will be something bright for minnie to look at  we ll do it  but
what was your idea  mary  

 mine was a sand bag  didn   you hear minnie say   mamma  the sheet is
quite wet just where my foot comes   and mrs  banister came in a hurry
and took away the hot water bag  and said there was something wrong with
the screw  and it was always leaking  my aunt  who is an invalid  uses
a bag of sand instead  it is made very hot in the oven and slipped into
a little cover  and it keeps warm longer than hot water does  she says 
don   you think we might make one for minnie  

 it   the best idea yet   said catherine   and we will have it for next
saturday because it   something useful that she really wants  and that
will give us plenty of time to dry the leaves for the saturday after  

the sand bag  with its little slip cover of red canton flannel  proved a
remarkable success  it was the comfort of her life  minnie declared  but
the joy of her life was the wall basket which followed on the next
saturday  and which made a beautiful spot of brightness on the bare
wall  ethel hooper  who had a natural instinct for color and effect 
arranged it  it held branches of deep red and vivid yellow leaves  with
sprays of orange and green sumach  deep russet oak and trails of flaming
blackberry vine  amid which rose a few velvet brown cat tails and fluffy
milk weed pods  supporting in their midst a tiny bird   nest poised in a
leafless twig  minnie was never tired of looking at it  she said it was
as good as taking a walk in the woods to see it  the gay color
refreshed her eyes  and cheered many a dull moment when she was alone
and did not feel like reading  and  altogether  the wall basket proved
one of the most successful of the achievements of the do something
society that winter 

i have not time to tell you of all the many other things they did  one
saturday the gift was a home made sponge cake  another time it was some
particularly nice molasses candy  pulled very white  and braided and
twirled into     and      a pillow stuffed with balsam fir was another
of the presents  on christmas eve they carried her the tiniest little
fir tree ever seen  a mere baby of a fir  planted in a flower pot  hung
with six mandarin oranges  and lighted with wax matches which burned
just long enough to be admired and no longer  later there was a comical
valentine  and on minnie   birthday a pretty card  designed by
catherine  who had a taste for drawing 

one melancholy saturday  when minnie was too ill to see them  the
members all left their cards in a little basket  another time it was the
cards of all their pet cats  and while they thus labored to make the
hard months less hard for their friend  their own souls were growing 
keeping pace with their growing bodies  as souls do which are properly
exercised in deeds of kindliness and unselfish love  so that when spring
came  bringing roses back to minnie   pale cheeks  and strength to her
feeble limbs  and she was able to take her place among the rest and be a
 do something  too  all of them were eager to keep on  and to continue
the work begun for one  by service for the many who needed cheering as
much as minnie had done 

and the best part of the lesson which all of them had learned was  so
mrs  newcombe thought  the great lesson that money  though a useful  is
not an essential  part of true helpfulness  and that time given  and
thought  and observation  and ingenuity  and loving hearts  can
accomplish without it all the best and sweetest part of giving 




who ate the queen   luncheon 


you can imagine the state of excitement into which otillie le breton was
thrown  when  one day in june  her father  the seigneur of sark  came
home and told her that the queen  who was cruising about the channel in
the royal yacht  had notified him of her intention of landing at sark
the next thursday and of lunching at the seigneurie 

it sounds such a fine thing to be the daughter of the seigneur of sark 
that perhaps you will imagine that otillie was used to kings and queens
and fine company of all sorts  and wonder that she should feel so much
excited on this occasion  not at all  the seigneur of sark is only a
quiet  invalid clergyman who owns his little island just as other
english gentlemen do their estates  letting out the land to farmers and
collecting his rents and paying his taxes like other people  and otillie
was a simply brought up girl of fourteen  who knew much less of the
world than most girls of her age in boston or new york  had never been
off the channel islands  and never set eyes on a  crowned head  in her
life  and she felt exactly as any of us would if we were suddenly told
that a queen was coming to take a meal in our father   house 

queens are not common apparitions in any of the channel islands  and
least of all in little sark  it is a difficult place to get to even for
common people  the island  which is only three miles long  is walled by
a line of splendid cliffs over three hundred feet high  its only harbor
is a strip of beach  defended by a tiny breakwater  from which a steep
road is tunnelled up through the rocks to the interior of the island  in
rough weather  when the wind blows and the sea runs high  which is the
case five days out of seven in summer  and six and a half days out of
seven in winter  boats dare not make for this difficult landing  which
is called by the natives  the creux   or hole  it is reported that some
years since when the lords of the admiralty were on a tour of inspection
they sailed all round sark and sailed away again  reporting that no
place could be discovered where it was possible to land  which seemed
to the sarkites a very good joke indeed 

there are four principal islands in the channel group  alderney and
jersey  from which come the cows all of us know about  guernsey  whose
cattle  though not so celebrated on this side of the sea  are held by
the islanders as superior to all others  and sark  the smallest and by
far the most beautiful of the four  it is a real story book island  the
soft  sea climate and the drifting mists of the gulf stream nourish in
its green valleys all manner of growing things  flowers flourish there
as nowhere else  heliotropes grow into great clumps  and red and pink
geraniums into bushes  fuchsias and white starred jessamines climb to
the very roofs of the mossy old farm houses  which stand knee deep  as
it were  in vines and flowers  long links of rose colored bindweed lie
in tangles along the dusty roadside  you tread on them as you walk
through the shady lanes  between hedge rows of ivy and sweet brier and
briony  from whose leaves shine out little glittering beetles  in mail
coats of flashing  iridescent green  like those which the cuban ladies
wear on their lace dresses as a decoration  there is only one wagon
kept for hire on the island  and all is primitive and peaceful and full
of rest and repose 

but there are wonderful things too  as well as beautiful ones   strange
spouting holes in the middle of green fields  where the sea has worn its
way far inland  and  with a roar  sends sudden shocks of surf up through
its chimney like vent  caves too  full of dim green light  in whose
pools marvellous marine creatures flourish  

     the fruitage and bloom of the ocean  

or strange spines of rock path linking one end of the island with the
other by a road not over five feet wide  from whose undefended edges the
sheer precipice goes down on either side for hundreds of feet into the
ocean  there are natural arches in the rocks also through which the
wonderful blue green sea glances and leaps  all about the island the
water is of this remarkable color  like the plumage of a peacock or a
dragonfly   glancing wings  and out of it rise strange rock shapes 
pyramids and obelisks and domes  over which white surf breaks
constantly 

some of the most remarkable of these rocks are beneath the seigneurie 
whose shaven lawns and walled gardens stretch to the cliff top and
command a wide sea view  it is a fine old house  with terraces and stone
balustrades over which vines cluster thickly  and peacocks sit 
spreading their many eyed tails to the sun  as if trying to outdo the
strange  flashing  iridescent sea 

otillie herself always fed these peacocks  which were old family
friends  there were six of them  bluet and cramoisie   the parents of
the flock  who had been named by mrs  le breton  who was a
frenchwoman   peri and fee de fees  and lorenzo the magnificent and the
great panjandrum  these last christened by otillie herself on account of
their size and stately demeanor  the beautiful creatures were quite
tame  they would take food from her hand  and if she failed to present
herself at the accustomed time with her bowl of millet and bread  they
would put their heads in at the terrace windows and scream  till she
recollected her duty and came to them 

i am afraid that the peacocks were rather neglected for the few days
preceding the queen   visit  for everybody at the seigneurie was very
busy  mr  le breton  as a general thing  lived simply enough  his wife
had died when otillie was only six years old  miss niffin the governess 
marie the cook  two housemaids  and an old butler who had served the
family for a quarter of a century made up the establishment indoors 
otillie had her basin of porridge and cream and her slice of bread at
eight o clock every morning  and bread and milk and  kettle tea  for
supper  with now and then a taste of jam by way of a treat  the servants
lived chiefly on  jersey soup   a thick broth of oatmeal  vegetables 
and fish  with a trifle of bacon or salt beef to give it a relish  mr 
le breton had his morning coffee in his study  and the early dinner 
which he shared with otillie and miss niffin  was not an elaborate one 

these being the customs of the seigneurie  it can easily be imagined
that it taxed every resource of the establishment to provide suitably
for the queen   entertainment  all the island knew of the important
event and longed to advise and help  the farmers sent their thickest
cream and freshest strawberries and lettuces  desirous to prove their
loyalty not to their sovereign only  but also to their landlord  marie 
the cook  spent the days in reading over her most difficult recipes 
and could not sleep at night  a friend of hers  once second cook to the
earl of dunraven  but now retired on her laurels into private life 
offered to come for a few days to assist  and to fabricate a certain
famous game pasty  of which it was asserted the english aristocracy are
inordinately fond  peter the butler crossed over to guernsey twice
during the week with a long list of indispensables to be filled up at
the shops there  hampers of wine came from london  and hot house grapes
and nectarines from friends in jersey  the whole house was in a bustle 
and nothing was spoken of but the queen and the queen   visit  what she
would wear and say and do  whom she would bring with her  and what sort
of weather she would have for her coming 

this last point was the one on which otillie was most solicitous  a true
child of sark  she knew all about its tides and currents  the dangers of
the island channels  and the differences which a little more or less
wind and sea made in the navigation of them  she could recollect one
stormy winter  when a guernsey doctor who had come over to set a broken
arm was detained for three weeks on the island  in plain sight all the
time of his own home in st  peterport  but as unable to get to it as if
it had been a thousand miles away 

 it would be dreadful if the queen came and then could not get away
again for three weeks   she said to herself   it would be awfully
interesting to have her here  of course  but i don   quite know what we
should do  or what she would do   she tried to make a picture of it in
her mind  but soon gave up the attempt  provisions are scarce sometimes
on sark when the wind blows and the boats cannot get in  there would
always be milk and vegetables and fruit if it were summer  and perhaps
chickens enough could be collected to hold out  but there was something
terrible in the idea of a queen without butcher   meat  otillie  
imagination refused to compass it 

her very first thought when the important day dawned was the weather 

she waked with the first sunbeam and ran at once to the window  when she
saw a clear sky and the sun rising out of a still sea  she gave a scream
of delight 

 what is the matter   asked miss niffin sleepily from the next room 

 it   good weather   replied otillie   we ve got the most beautiful day
for the queen to come in  

miss niffin   only answer was a little groan  she was a small  shy
person  and the idea of confronting royalty made her dreadfully nervous 
 oh  if the day were only over   she said to herself  and she longed to
plead a headache and stay in bed  but she dared not  besides  she felt
that it would be cowardly to desert her post on such an important
occasion and leave otillie alone  so she braced her mind to face the
awful necessity and began to dress 

mr  le breton  awakening about the same time  gave a groan a good deal
like miss niffin    he was a loyal subject  and felt the honor that was
done him by the queen   inviting herself to luncheon  but  all the same 
invalids do not like to be put out of their way  and he  too  wished the
day well done 

 ten to one i shall be laid up for the next month to pay for it   he
reflected  then he too braced himself to the necessity and rang for hot
water  determined to do his duty as a man and a seigneur 

otillie was perhaps the only person in the house who was really glad to
have the day come  the servants were tired and fretted with a sense of
responsibility  marie had passed a dreadful night  full of dreams of
failure and spoiled dishes 

 now just as sure as guns my rolls will have failed to rise this day of
all the days of the year   was her first waking thought  but no  the
rolls were light as a feather  and the sponge and almond cakes came out
of the oven delicately browned and quite perfect in taste and
appearance  nothing went wrong  and when mr  le breton  just before
starting for the creux harbor to meet the royal party  took a look into
the dining room to make sure that all was right  he said to himself that
he had never seen a prettier or more complete little  spread  

the table was ornamented with hot house fruit and flowers  beautifully
arranged by miss niffin and otillie  all the fine old le breton plate
had been brought out and polished  the napery shone like iced snow 
there were some quaint pieces of old venetian glass  jugs  dishes  and
flagons  and a profusion of pretty confections  jellies  blanc manges 
crystallized fruits  and bonbons  to give sparkle and color  the light
streamed in at the windows which opened on the terrace  from under the
vines the flash of the waves could be seen  the curtains waved in the
wind  which was blowing inland  nothing could be prettier  the only
discord was the noisy scream of the peacocks on the lawn  who seemed as
much upset and disturbed by the great event as the rest of the
household 

 can   something be done to stop those creatures   said mr  le breton 
 tie them up somewhere  can   you  otillie  or send a boy to drive them
down to the farm  

 it   only because they are hungry   replied otillie rather absently   i
haven   given them their breakfast yet  

she was sticking long stems of fronded osmundas into a jar as a
decoration for the fireplace  and scarcely noticed what her father said 
it was some minutes after the carriage drove away before she finished 
then  with a sigh of relief  she brushed up the leaves she had scattered
on the carpet  and ran upstairs to change her dress  it would never do
to be caught by the queen in a holland frock  with her hair blown about
her eyes  and green finger tips 

the clock struck one as she fastened her white dress and patted smooth
the bows of her wide pink sash  one was the hour fixed for the queen to
land  so there was no time to lose  otillie only waited for a glance in
at the door of the spare room  where the queen  if so minded  was to
take off her things  she glanced at the bed with a sort of awe as the
possible repository of a royal bonnet  altered the position of a bowl of
roses on the mantelpiece  and then hurried down to join miss niffin 
who  attired in her best black silk and a pair of lace mitts  was seated
decorously in the hall doing nothing  otillie sat down beside her  it
was rather a nervous waiting  and a long one  for half an hour passed 
three quarters  and finally the clock struck two  before wheels were
heard on the gravel  and during all that time the two watchers spoke
scarcely a word  only once otillie cried as a gust of wind blew the
curtains straight out into the room   o dear  i hope it isn   rough  o
dear  wouldn   it be dreadful if the queen were to be sick  she would
never like sark again  

 i think her majesty must be used to the sea  she sails so much  
replied miss niffin  the gust died away and did not blow the curtains
any more  and again they sat in silence  waiting and listening 

 at last   cried otillie as the distinct roll of wheels was heard on
the drive  her heart beat fast  but she got up bravely  straightened her
slender little figure as became a le breton  and walked out on to the
porch  her eyes seemed strangely dazzled by the sun  for she could see
no one in the carriage but her father 

it rolled up to the door  and otillie felt a great throb of
disappointment rise like a wave in her heart  and spread and swell  mr 
le breton had come back alone 

 papa   she cried  as soon as she could speak   what  has  happened 
where is the queen  

 i hope nothing has gone amiss with her gracious majesty   put in miss
niffin from behind 

mr  le breton got out of the carriage before he replied  he looked tired
and annoyed 

 you can drive to the stable  thomas   he said   the carriage will not
be wanted   then he turned to miss niffin 

 her gracious majesty has decided not to land   he went on   the wind
has sprung up and made rather a sea outside the breakwater  nothing to
signify by the sark standard  but enough to deter inexperienced persons 
i waited at the creux for nearly an hour  and every man  woman  and
child on the island waited with me  with the exception of you and
otillie and the servants  and then the captain of the royal yacht
signalled that he could not risk putting the queen ashore in a small
boat in such rough water  so the thing is given up  

there was a certain latent relief in mr  le breton   tone 

 oh   cried otillie  stamping her foot   how hateful of the wind to
spring up  it could have waited as well as not  it has all the rest of
the time to blow in  and now all the nice preparations are thrown away 
and all our pleasant time spoiled  and just as likely as not the queen
will never come to sark at all   her voice died away into a storm of
sobs 

 i wish i could be assured of that   remarked her father in a tone of
weary resignation   what i am afraid of is that she will come  or try to
come  another day  and then there will be all this to do over again  

he indicated by a gesture the door of the dining room  from which queer
muffled sounds were heard just then 

 peter seems as much afflicted by this disappointment as you are 
otillie   he added   come  my child  don   cry over the matter  it can  
be helped  wind and waves oblige nobody  not even kings and queens  

 there are compensations for all our troubles   said miss niffin in her
primmest tone   we must bear up  and try to feel that all is for the
best   miss niffin seemed to find it quite easy to be morally consoled
for her share of loss in the giving up of the queen   visit 

 how can you talk in that way   cried otillie  who was not in the least
in awe of miss niffin   if i had broken my comb  you would have said
exactly the same  i know you would  there isn   any compensation at all
for this trouble  and it   no use my trying to feel that it   for the
best   it isn    

 we never know   replied miss niffin piously 

 come   said mr  le breton  desiring to put an end to the altercation 
 i don   know why we should go hungry because her majesty won   come and
eat our luncheon  take my arm  miss niffin  and let us have something to
eat  marie will break her heart if all her trouble and pains are not
appreciated by somebody

and finding the windows open  had entered and helped themselves    page

he gave his arm to miss niffin as he spoke  and moved forward to the
dining room  otillie followed  wiping her eyes with her handkerchief 
and feeling that the dainties would stick in her throat if she tried to
swallow them  she was so very  very  dreadfully disappointed 

but when mr  le breton reached the dining room door he stopped suddenly
as if shot  and gave a sort of shout  no one could speak for a moment 
there was the feast  so prettily and tastefully arranged only an hour
before  a mass of ruins  the flowers were upset  the fruit  tumbled and
mashed  stained the cloth and the floor  wine and lemonade dripped from
the table   edge  the pink and yellow jellies  the forms of charlotte
russe and blanc mange and the frosted cakes and tarts were reduced to
smears and crumbs  where the gigantic pasty had stood remained only an
empty dish  and above the remains  rearing  pecking  clawing  gobbling 
appeared six long blue green necks  which dipped and rose and dipped
again 

the peacocks  tired of waiting for their morning meal  and finding the
windows open  had entered and helped themselves  there was lorenzo the
magnificent with a sponge cake in his beak  and peri gobbling down a
lump of blanc mange  and the grand panjandrum with both claws embedded
in a pyramid of macaroons  their splendid tails were draggled with cream
and crumbs  and sticky with jelly  altogether they presented a most
greedy and disreputable appearance  the strangest part of the whole was
that while they stuffed themselves they preserved a dead silence  and
did not express their enjoyment by one of their usual noisy screams  it
was evident that they felt that the one great opportunity of their lives
was going on  and that they must make the most of it 

at the sound of mr  le breton   shout the peacocks started guiltily 
then they gathered up their tails as best they might  and  half flying 
half running  scuttled out of the windows and far across the lawn 
screaming triumphantly as they went  while otillie tumbled into a chair
and laughed till she cried 

 oh  didn   they look funny   she gasped  holding her sides 

 rather expensive fun   replied the seigneur ruefully   but it is one
comfort that we have it to ourselves   then the humor of the situation
seized on him also  and he sat down and laughed almost as hard as
otillie 

 dear me  what a mercy that her majesty didn   come   remarked miss
niffin in an awe struck tone 

 good gracious   cried otillie with sudden horror at the thought 
 suppose she had  suppose we had all walked in at that door and found
the peacocks here  and of course we should  of course they would have
done it just the same if there had been fifty queens to see them  how
dreadful it would have been  oh  there are compensations  miss niffin  i
see it now  

so otillie was reconciled to her great disappointment  though the queen
never has tried to land at sark again  and perhaps never will  for  as
otillie sensibly says   it is a great deal better that we should be
disappointed than that the queen should be  for if she had been very
hungry  and most likely she would have been after sailing and all  she
would not have thought the grand panjandrum with his feet in the
macaroons half so funny as we did  and would have been truly and really
vexed  

so it was all for the best  as miss niffin said 




the shipwrecked cologne bottle 


it seemed the middle of the night  though it was really only three
o clock in the morning  when little davy crocker was wakened by a sudden
stamping of feet on the stoop below his window  and by a voice calling
out that a ship was ashore off the point  and that captain si  davy  
uncle  must turn out and help with the life boat 

davy was a  landlubber   as his cousin sam coffin was wont to assert
whenever he wanted to tease him  he had lived all his short life at
townsend harbor  up among the new hampshire hills  and until this visit
to his aunt at nantucket  had never seen the sea  all the more the sea
had for him a great interest and fascination  as it has for everybody to
whom it has not from long familiarity become a matter of course 

conversation in nantucket is apt to possess a nautical and  so to speak 
salty flavor  davy  since his arrival  had heard so much about ships
which had foundered  or gone to pieces on rocks  or burned up  or sprung
leaks and had to be pumped out  that his mind was full of images of
disaster  and he quite longed to realize some of them  to see a
shipwreck had become his great ambition  he was not particular as to
whether the ship should burn or founder or go ashore  any of these would
do  only he wanted all the sailors to be saved 

once he had gone with his cousins to the south shore on the little
puffing railroad which connects nantucket town with siasconsett  and of
which all the people of the island are so justly proud  and there on the
beach  amid the surf rollers which look so soft and white and are so
cruelly strong  he had seen a great piece of a ship  nearly the whole of
the bow end it appeared to be  it was much higher than davy   head  and
seemed to him immense and formidable  yet this enormous thing the sea
had taken into its grasp and tossed to and fro like a plaything and at
last flung upon the sand as if it were a toy of which it had grown
weary  it gave davy an idea of the great power of the water  and it was
after seeing this that he began to long to witness a shipwreck  and now
there was one  and the very sound of the word was enough to make him rub
open his sleepy eyes and jump out of bed in a hurry 

but when he had groped his way to the window and pulled up the rattling
paper shade  behold  there was nothing to be seen  the morning was
intensely dark  a wild wind was blowing great dashes of rain on the
glass  and the house shook and trembled as the blasts struck it 

davy heard his uncle on the stairs  and hurried to the door   mayn   i
go to the shipwreck with you  uncle si   he called out 

 go to what  go back to bed  my boy  that   the place for you  there ll
be shipwreck enough in the morning to satisfy all of us  i reckon  

davy dared not disobey  he stumbled back to bed  making up his mind to
lie awake and listen to the wind till it was light  and then go to see
the shipwreck  anyhow   but it is hard to keep such resolutions when you
are only ten years old  the next thing he knew he was rousing in
amazement to find the room full of brilliant sunlight  the rain was
over  though the wind still thundered furiously  and through the noise
it made  the sea could be heard thundering louder still 

davy jumped out of bed  dressed as fast as he could  and hurried
downstairs  the house seemed strangely empty  aunt patty was not in the
kitchen  nor was cousin myra in the pantry skimming milk  as was usual
at this hour of the day  davy searched for them in woodshed  garden  and
barn  at last he spied them on the  walk  at the top of the house  and
ran upstairs to join them 

do any of you know what a  walk  is  i suppose not  unless you have
happened to live in a whaling town  many houses in nantucket have them 
they are railed platforms  built on the peak of the roof between the
chimneys  and are used as observatories from which to watch what is
going on at sea  there the wives and sweethearts of the whalers used to
go in the old days  and stand and sweep the ocean with spy glasses  in
hopes of seeing the ships coming in from their long cruises each with
the signals set which told if the voyage had been lucky or no  and how
many barrels of oil and blubber she was bringing home  then they used to
watch the  camels   great hulls used as floats to lighten the vessels 
go out and help the heavy laden ship over the bar  and when that was
done and every rope and spar conned and studied by the experienced eyes
on the roofs  it was time to hurry down  hang on the welcoming pot  trim
the fire and don the best gown  so as to make a bright home coming for
the long absent husband or son 

aunt patty had a spy glass at her eyes when davy gained the roof  she
was looking at the wrecked ship  which was plainly in view  beyond the
little sandy down which separated the house from the sea  there she lay 
a poor broken thing  stuck fast on one of the long reaches of sandy
shoal which stretch about the island and make the navigation of its
narrow and uncertain channels so difficult and sometimes so dangerous 
the heavy seas dashed over the half sunken vessel every minute  between
her and the shore two lifeboats were coming in under closely reefed
sails 

 oh  do let me look through the glass   urged davy  when he was
permitted to do so he uttered an exclamation of surprise  so wonderfully
near did it make everything seem to be 

 why  i can see their faces   he cried   there   uncle si  there   sam 
and there   a very wet man  i guess he   one of the shipwrecked sailors 
hurrah   and davy capered up and down 

 you unfeeling boy   cried myra   give me the glass  you ll let it fall 
he   right  mother  father and sam are coming ashore as fast as they can
sail  and they ll be wanting their breakfasts  of course  i   better go
down and mix the corn bread   she took one more look through the glass 
announced that the other boat had some more of the shipwrecked men on
board  she guessed  and that abner folger was steering  then she ran
down the ladder  followed by her mother  and davy was left to watch the
boats in 

when he too went down  the kitchen was full of good smells of boiling
coffee and frying eggs  and his uncle and sam and the  very wet man 
were just entering the door together  the wet man  it appeared  was the
captain of the wrecked vessel  the rest of the crew had been taken home
by other people 

the captain was a long  brown  sinewy maine man  he was soaked with
sea water and looked haggard and worn  as a man well might who had just
spent such a terrible night  but he had kind  melancholy eyes  and a
nice face  davy thought  the first thing to be done was to get him into
dry clothes  and uncle si carried him up to davy   room for this
purpose  davy followed them  he felt as if he could never see enough of
this  his first shipwrecked sailor 

when the captain had been made comfortable in uncle silas   flannel
shirt and spare pea jacket and a pair of sam   trousers  he hung his own
clothes up to dry  and they all went down to breakfast  aunt patty had
done her best  she was very sorry for the poor man who had lost his
ship  and she even brought out a tumbler of her best grape jelly by way
of a further treat  but the captain  though he ate ravenously  as was
natural to a man who had fasted so long  did not seem to notice what he
was eating  and thus disappointed kind aunt patty  she comforted herself
by thinking what she could get for dinner which he would like  uncle si
and sam were almost as hungry as the maine captain  so not much was said
till breakfast was over  and then they all jumped up and hurried out 
for there was a deal to be done 

davy felt very dull after they had gone  he had never heard of such a
thing as  reaction   but that was what he was suffering from  the
excitement of the morning had died out like a fire which has no more
fuel to feed it  and he could not think of anything that he wanted to
do  he hung listlessly round  watching aunt patty   brisk operations
about the kitchen  and at last he thought he would go upstairs and see
if the captain   clothes were beginning to dry  wet as they were  they
seemed on the whole the most interesting things in the house 

the clothes were not nearly dry  but on the floor  just below where the
rough pea jacket hung  lay a little shining object  it attracted davy  
attention  and he stooped and picked it up 

it was a tiny bottle full of some sort of perfume  and set in a socket
of plated filagree shaped like a caster  with a filagree handle  the
bottle had a piece of white kid tied over its cork with a bit of blue
ribbon  it was not a thing to tempt a boy   fancy  but davy saw that it
was pretty  and the idea came into his head that he should like to carry
it home  to his little sister bella  bella was fond of perfumes  and
the bottle had cologne in it  as davy could smell without taking out the
cork  he was sure that bella would like it 

davy had been brought up to be honest  i am sure that he did not mean to
steal the cologne bottle  the idea of stealing never entered his mind 
and it would have shocked him had it done so  he was an imaginative
little fellow  and the tiny waif seemed to him like a shell or a pebble 
something coming out of the sea  which any one was at liberty to pick up
and keep  he did not say to himself that it probably belonged to the
captain  who might have a value for it  he did not think about the
captain at all  he only thought of bella  so after looking at the pretty
toy for a while  he put it carefully away in the drawer where he kept
his things  pushing it far back  and drawing a pair of stockings in
front of it  so that it might be hidden  he did not want anybody to
meddle with the bottle  it was his now  or rather it was bella    then
he went up to the walk once more  and was so interested in watching the
wreck and the boats  which  as the wind moderated  came and went between
her and the shore  picking up the barrels and casks which were floated
out of her hold  that he soon forgot all about the matter 

it was nearly dark before the two captains and sam came back to eat the
meal which had been ready for them since the middle of the afternoon 
aunt patty had taken off her pots and saucepans more than once and put
them on again  to suit the long delay  but nothing was spoiled and
everything tasted good  which showed how cleverly she had managed  the
maine captain  whose name it appeared was joy  seemed more cheerful than
in the morning  and more inclined to talk  but after supper  when he had
gone upstairs and put on his own clothes  which aunt patty had kept
before the fire nearly all day and had pressed with hot irons so that
they looked almost as good as ever  his melancholy seemed to come on
again  he sat and puffed at his pipe till aunt patty began to ask
questions about the wreck  captain joy  it appeared  was part owner of
the ship  whose name was the  sarah jane  

 she was called after my wife   sister   he told them   and my little
girl to home has the same name   sarah jane   she is about the age of
that boy there  or a mite older maybe    nodding toward davy   she
wanted to come with me this vy age  but her mother wouldn   hear of it 
and i   mighty thankful she wouldn    as things have turned out  no
child could have stood the exposure of such a night as we had and come
out alive  and sarah jane  though she   as spry as a cricket and always
on the go  isn   over strong  

the captain took a long pull at his pipe and looked dreamily into the
fire 

 i asked her  just as i was coming off  what i should bring her   he
went on   and she had a wish all fixed and ready  i never knew such a
child for knowing her own mind  she   always sure what she wants  sarah
jane is  the thing she wanted was a cologne bottle  she said  and it
must be just so  shaped like one of them pepper and vinegar what    you
call em    that they put on hotel tables  she was very pertikeler about
the kind  she drew me a picter of it on her slate  so    to have no
mistake  and i promised her if new york could furnish it she should have
that identical article  and she was mighty pleased  

nobody noticed that at the mention of the cologne bottle  davy gave a
guilty jump  and shrank back into the shadow of uncle si   broad
shoulders  oh  if he could only put it back into the pocket of the
pea jacket  but how could he when the captain had the jacket on 

 i was kind of fearful that there wouldn   be any bottles of that
pertikeler shape that sarah jane had in her mind   continued captain
joy   but the town seemed to be chock full of  em  the very first shop i
come to  there they stood in the window  rows of  em  and i just went in
and bought one for sarah jane before i did anything else  and when i  
got it safely stowed away in the locker  i felt kind of easy in my mind 
we come down with a load of coal  but i hadn   more    a quarter cargo
to take back  mostly groceries for the stores up to bucksport and
ellsworth   and it   lucky it was no more  as things have happened  the
schooner was pretty old and being so light in ballast  i jedged it
safest  when the blow come on so hard from the nor  east  to run it
under the lee of cape cod and ride it out there if we could  but we
hadn   been anchored more    three hours  just about nine o clock it
was  when the men came to tell me that we was taking in water terrible
fast  i suppose the ship had kind of strained her seams open in the
gale  it want no use trying to pump her out in such a storm  and if we
didn   want to go down at our anchorage  there wasn   anything for it
but to cut her loose and drive across the haven in hopes of going
aground on the sand before she sank  i can tell you if ever a man
prayed  i prayed then  when i thought every minute she   founder in deep
water before we struck the shoal  and just as she was settling i heard
the sand grate under the keel  and you may believe i was thankful 
though it meant the loss of pretty much all i ve got in the world  i
shouted to the men to get to the rigging in the mainmast  for i knew
she   go to pieces pretty soon  and there wasn   no way of signalling
for help till daylight  and i gave one dive for the cabin  got the
papers out of the locker  and sarah jane   cologne bottle  buttoned them
up inside my pea coat  and just got back again in time to see the
foremast go over the side and the sea make a clean sweep of the decks 
the mainmast stayed  and we lashed ourselves  and managed to hold on
till sunrise  when we see you a coming out to us  and glad we were 

 every now and then in the night  when the water was washing over us  i
put my fingers inside my coat and made sure that sarah jane   bottle was
there  and wasn   broken  i didn   want the child to be disappointed 
you see  it was safe when we come ashore  i   certain of that  but   
the captain paused 

 now don   say it got broken after all   cried myra sympathetically 

 no  it wasn   broken  but it   just as bad   said captain joy   either
i dropped it getting out of the boat and trod it down in the sand  or
else some one has took it  it   gone  any way  and do you know  it   a
foolish thing to say  but i feel nigh as bad about that there little dud
as wasn   worth more    fifty cents  as i do about the loss of the hull
cargo  on account of sarah jane  

there was a pause as he ceased  aunt patty and myra were too sorry for
the captain to feel like speaking at once  suddenly into the silence
there fell the sound of a sob  everybody started  and uncle si caught
davy   arm and pulled him into the firelight where his face could be
seen 

 why  what are you crying for  little  un   asked uncle si 

 i   so sorry  i didn   know it was the captain     said davy  in a
tear choked voice 

 didn   know what was the captain    now  davy crocker   twasn   ever
you who took that bottle   cried aunt patty 

 i found it on the floor   sobbed davy   i thought it was washed ashore
from the shipwreck  i didn   suppose it belonged to anybody  and i
wanted it for bella  oh  i   so sorry  

 why  then it ain   lost after all   cried captain joy  brightening up 
 well  how pleased sarah jane  will  be  don   cry any more  my lad  i
can see how it was  and that you didn   think it was stealing to take
anything that had been in the sea  

aunt patty and myra  however  still were deeply shocked  and could not
look as lightly at davy   offence as did the captain  davy crept
upstairs  brought down the cologne bottle and slid it into captain joy  
hand  then he crept away and sat in a dark corner behind the rest  but
his conscience followed him  and myra   reproachful look 

 oh  davy   she whispered   i never thought you   be so mean as to take
anything from a shipwrecked sailor  

this was davy   punishment  and rankled in his mind long after everybody
else had forgotten the matter  after the sands had swallowed up all that
was left of the  sarah jane   and after the captain had returned to
bucksport and made the real sarah jane happy by the gift of the bottle
she had wished for so much  it rankles occasionally to this day  though
he is now a stout lad of fifteen  that he  he of all boys  should have
done such a thing to a man just saved from the sea  he consoles himself
by resolving to be particularly kind to shipwrecked sailors all the rest
of his life  but unluckily  the  sarah jane  is  so far  his sole
experience of a wreck  and the only sailor he has as yet had any chance
to do anything for is captain joy  and what he did for him we all know 
one does not always have the opportunity to make up for a blunder or a
fault  and i am afraid davy may live his life out and never again have
the good luck to show his good intentions by  not  picking up and hiding
a shipwrecked cologne bottle 




under a syringa bush 


the old syringa at the foot of the wade   lawn was rather a tree than a
bush  many years of growth had gone to the thickening of its interlaced
boughs  which grew close to the ground  and made an impervious covert 
except on the west side  where a hollow recess existed  into which a
small person  boy or girl  might squeeze and be quite hidden 

sundry other small persons with wings and feathers had discovered the
advantages of the syringa  all manner of unsuspected housekeepings went
on within its fastnesses  from the lark   nest  in a tuft of grass at
the foot of the main stem  to the robin   home on the topmost bough 
solicitous little mothers brooded unseen over minute families  while the
highly decorative bird papa sat on a neighboring hedge  carrying out his
mission  which seemed to be to distract attention from the secreted
family by the sweetness of his song and the beauty of his plumage  in
the dusk of the evening  soft thrills and twitters sounded from the
bush  like whispered conversation  and very entertaining it must have
been  no doubt  to any one who understood the language  so  altogether 
the old syringa bush was an interesting little world of itself 

elly wade found it so  as she sat in the green hiding place on the west
side  crying as if her heart would break  the syringa recess had been
her favorite  secret  ever since she discovered it  nearly two years
before  no one else knew about it  there she went when she felt unhappy
or was having a mood  once the boughs had closed in behind her  no one
could suspect that she was there   a fact which gave her infinite
pleasure  for she was a child who loved privacies and mysteries 

what are moods  does any one exactly understand them  some people
attribute them to original sin  others to nerves or indigestion  but i
am not sure that either explanation is right  they sweep across the
gladness of our lives as clouds across the sun  and seem to take the
color out of everything  grown people learn to conceal  if not to
conquer  their moods  but children cannot do this  elly wade least of
all 

as i said  this was by no means her first visit to the syringa bush  it
has witnessed some stormy moments in her life  when she sat there hot
and grieved  and in her heart believing everybody cruel or unjust  ralph
had teased her  or cora  who was older than she  had put on airs  or
little kitty had been troublesome  or some schoolmate  hateful   she
even accused her mother of unkindness at these times  though she loved
her dearly all the while 

 she thinks the rest are always right  and i wrong   she would say to
herself   oh  well  she ll be sorry some day   what was to make mrs 
wade sorry elly did not specify  but i think it was to be when she 
herself  was found dead  somewhere on the premises  of a broken heart 
elly was very fond of depicting this broken heart and tragical
ending   imaginative children often are  all the same  if she felt ill 
or cut her finger  she ran to mamma for help  and was as much frightened
as if she had not been thinking these deadly thoughts only a little
while before 

to day elly had fled to the syringa bush with no idea of ever coming out
again  a great wrong had been done her  cora was going with a
yachting party  and she was not  mamma had said she was too young to be
trusted  and must wait till she was older and steadier 

 it is cruel   she said with a fresh burst of sobs  as she recalled the
bitter moment when she heard the verdict   it was just as unkind as
could be for her to say that  cora is only four years the oldest  and i
can do lots of things that she can    she doesn   know a bit about
crocheting  she just knits  and she never made sponge cake  and i have 
and when she rows  she pulls the hardest with her left hand  and makes
the boat wabble  i ve a much better stroke than she has  papa said so 
and i can swim just as well as she can 

 nobody loves me   was her next reflection    nobody at all  they all
hate me  i don   suppose anybody would care a bit if i  did  die  

but this thought was too hard to be borne 

 yes  they would   she went on   they   feel remorse if i died  and they
ought to  then they would recollect all the mean things they ve done to
me  and they would groan  and say   too late  too late   like the bad
people in story books  

comforted by this idea  she resolved on a plan of action 

 i ll just stay here forever  and not come out at all  of course  i
shall starve to death  then  all summer long they ll be hunting  and
wondering and wondering what has become of me  and when the autumn
comes  and the leaves fall off  they ll know  and they ll say   poor
elly  how we wish we   treated her better   

she settled herself into a more comfortable position   it isn  
necessary to have cramps  you know  even if you  are  starving to
death   and went on with her reflections  so still was she that the
birds forgot her presence  and continued their twittering gossip and
their small domestic arrangements undisturbed  the lark talked to her
young ones with no fear of being overheard  the robins flew in and out
with worms  the thrush  who occupied what might be called the second
story of the syringa  disciplined a refractory fledgling  and papa
thrush joined in with a series of musical expostulations  elly found
their affairs so interesting that for a moment she forgot her
own   which was good for her 

a big bumble bee came sailing through the air like a wind blown drum 
and stopped for a minute to sip at a syringa blossom  next a soft whir
drew elly   attention  and a shape in green and gold and ruby red
glanced across her vision like a flying jewel  it was a
humming bird   the first of the season  elly had never been so near one
before  nor had so long a chance to look  and she watched with delight
as the pretty creature darted to and fro  dipping its needle like bill
into one flower cup after another  in search of the honey drop which
each contained  she held her breath  not to startle it  but its fine
senses seemed to perceive her presence in some mysterious fashion  and
presently it flew away 

elly   mind  no longer diverted  went back to its unhappiness 

 i wonder how long it is since i came here   she thought   it seems like
a great while  i guess it must be as much as three hours  they re all
through dinner now  and beginning to wonder where i am  but they won  
find me  i can tell them  

she set her lips firmly  and again shifted her position  at the slight
rustle every bird in the bush became silent 

 they needn     she said to herself   i wouldn   hurt them  i   not like
ralph  he   real bad to birds sometimes  once he took some eggs out of a
dear  cunning  little song sparrow   nest  and blew the yolks  i   never
do such a mean thing as that  

but though she tried to lash herself up to her old sharpness of feeling 
the interruption of wrathful thoughts had somewhat soothed her mood 
still  she held firmly to her purpose  while an increasing drowsiness
crept over her 

 i shall stay here all night   she thought   and all to morrow  and
to morrow night  and then   a yawn   pretty soon i shall be dead  i
suppose  and they ll be  sorry   another yawn   and   

elly was asleep 

when she woke  the bright noon sunshine had given place to a dusky
light  which made the syringa recess very dark  the robins had
discovered her whereabouts  and  hopping nearer and nearer  had perched
upon a branch close to her feet  and were talking about her  she was
dimly conscious of their voices  but had no idea what they were saying 

 why did it come here  any way   asked mrs  robin   a great heavy thing
like that in  our  bush  

 i don   know  i   sure   replied mr  robin   it makes a strange noise 
but it keeps its eyes shut while it makes it  

 these great creatures are so queer   pursued mrs  robin   there   it  
beginning to move  i wish it would go away  i don   like its being so
near the children  they might see it and be frightened  

the two birds flitted hastily off as elly stretched herself and rubbed
her eyes 

a very uncomfortable gnawing sensation began to make itself evident  it
wasn   exactly pain  but elly felt that it might easily become so  she
remembered now that she fled away from the table  leaving her breakfast
only half finished  yesterday morning   was it yesterday  or was it the
day before that  it felt like a long while ago 

the sensation increased 

 dear me   thought elly   the story books never said that starving to
death felt so  i don   like it a bit  

bravely she fought against the discomfort  but it gained upon her 

she began to meditate whether her family had perhaps not been
sufficiently punished 

 i ve been away a whole day   she reflected   and a whole night  and i
guess they ve felt badly enough  very likely they ve all sat up waiting
for me to come back  they ll be sorry they acted so  and  any way  i  
so dreadfully hungry that i must have something to eat  and i want to
see mamma too  perhaps she ll have repented  and will say   poor elly 
she  may  go   

in short  elly was seized with a sudden desire for home  and  always
rapid in decision  she lost no time in wriggling herself out of the
bush 

 there  it   gone   chirped the female robin   i   glad of it  i hope it
will never come back  

very cautiously elly crept through the shrubbery on to the lawn  it
still seemed dark  but she now perceived that the gloom came from a
great thunder cloud which was gathering overhead  she could not see the
sun  and  confused with her long sleep  was not able to make out what
part of the day it was  but  somehow  she felt that it was not the early
morning as in the bush she had supposed 

across the lawn she stole  and upon the piazza  no one was visible  the
open window showed the dining table set for something   was it tea 
upstairs she crept  and  looking in at the door as she went by  she saw
her mother in her room taking off her bonnet 

 my poor child  where did you think we had gone   she called out   papa
was kept in town till the second train  and that was late  so we have
only just got back  you must be half starved  waiting so long for your
dinner  i hope nurse gave you some bread and milk  

 why   what day is it   stammered the amazed elly 

 day  why  elly  have you been asleep  it   to day  of
course   thursday  what did you think it was  

elly rubbed her eyes  bewildered  had the time which seemed to her so
long really been so short  had no one missed her  it was her first
lesson in the comparative unimportance of the individual  a sense of
her own foolishness seized her  mamma looked so sweet and kind  why had
she imagined her cruel 

 did you go to sleep  dear   repeated mrs  wade 

 yes  mamma   replied elly  humbly   i did  but i   waked up now  




two girls  two parties 


a great bustle and confusion had reigned the whole week long in the old
house at the top of the hilly street  known to the neighborhood as  the
squire     all the slip covers had been taken from the furniture in the
best parlor  all the company china had been lifted off its top shelf and
washed  all the spare lamps had been filled  all the rooms swept and
dusted  all the drawers in the bureaus freshly arranged  for  as milly
said to herself   who knew but some one might take a fancy to peep in  

milly grace  the squire   daughter  had sat for hours in a cold woodshed
tying up wreaths of ground pine and hemlock with fingers which grew more
chilly every hour  these wreaths now ornamented the parlor  festooning
curtains  chimney piece  and door frames  and making green edges to the
family portraits  which were two in number  neither of them by copley
or stuart  as was plain to the most casual observation 

one of these portraits represented the squire   father in a
short waisted  square tailed blue coat  and a canary colored waistcoat 
his forefinger was inserted in a calf bound volume of blackstone  and
his eyes were fixed with a fine judicial directness upon the cupola of
the court house seen through a window in the background  the other was
his wife  in a sad colored gown and muslin tucker  with a countenance
which suggested nothing except saleratus and the renunciation of all
human joys 

the squire did not care much for this picture  it made him feel badly 
he said  just the feeling he used to have when he was a boy and was sent
every sunday by this orthodox parent to study the longer answers of the
shorter catechism on the third step of the garret stairs  with orders
not to stir from that position till he had them perfectly committed to
memory  it was this strict bringing up  perhaps  which made him so
indulgent to milly   a great deal too indulgent her step mother thought 

in the buttery stood a goodly row of cakes little and big  loaves whose
icings shone like snow crust on a sunny day  little cakes with plums
and little cakes without plums  all sorts of cakes  on the swinging
shelf of the cellar were moulds of jelly clear and firm  in the
woodhouse stood three freezers of ice cream   packed  and ready to turn
out  elsewhere were dishes of scalloped oysters ready for the oven  each
with its little edging of crimped crackers  platters of chicken salad 
forms of blanc mange  bowls of yellow custard topped with
raspberry and egg like sunset tinted avalanches  all that goes to the
delectation of a country party  for a party there was to be  as after
this enumeration i need hardly state  it was milly   party  and all
these elaborate preparations were her own work   the work of a girl of
nineteen  with no larger allowance of hands  feet  and spinal vertebræ
than all girls have  and no larger allowance of hours to her day  but
with a much greater share of zeal  energy  and what the squire called
 go  than most young women of her age can boast of 

she it was who had pounded away at the tough sacks full of ice and salt
till they were ready for the freezers  she it was who had beaten the
innumerable eggs for the sponge cakes  pound cakes  fruit cakes   one 
two  three  four   jelly  nut and other cakes  who had swept the rooms 
washed the china  rearranged  changed  brightened everything  like most
other families on croydon hill  the graces kept but one  help   a stout
woman  who could wash  iron  and scrub with the best  and grapple
successfully enough with the simple daily  menu   but who for finer
purposes was as  unhandy  as a gorilla  all the embellishments  all the
delicate cookeries  fell to the share of the ladies of the household 
which meant milly as a general thing  and in this case particularly  for
the party was hers  and she felt bound to take the burden of it on her
own shoulders as far as possible  especially as her step mother did not
quite approve  and considered that the squire had done a foolish thing
in giving consent   milly should have her way for once   the squire had
announced 

so milly had her way  and had borne herself bravely and brightly through
the fatigues of preparation  but somehow when things were almost ready 
when the table was set  lacking only the last touches  and the fire
lighted  a heavy sense of discouragement fell upon her  it was the
natural reaction after long overwork  but she was too inexperienced to
understand it  she only knew that suddenly the thing she had wished for
seemed undesirable and worth nothing  and that she felt perfectly
miserable  and  didn   care what became of her   she laid her tired head
on the little table by which she was sitting  and  without in the least
intending it  began to cry 

mrs  grace was lying down  the squire was out  there was no one to note
her distress or sympathize with it excepting teakettle  the black cat 
he was sorry for milly after his cat fashion  rubbed his velvet head
against her dress for a little while as if wishing to console her  but
when she took no notice  he walked away and sat down in front of the
door  waiting till some one should open it and let him through  cats
soon weary of the role of comforter  and escape to pleasanter
things   sunshine  bird shadows on the grass  light hearted people who
will play with them and make no appeal to their sympathies 

milly   tears did her no good  she was too physically worn out to find
relief in them  they only deepened her sense of discouragement  the
clock struck six  she roused herself wearily and went upstairs to
dress  there were still the lamps to light and last things to do 

 and no one to do them but me   thought poor milly   oh dear  how
dreadfully my feet ache  how glad i shall be when they all go away and i
can go to bed  

this was indeed a sad state of mind to be in on the eve of a
long anticipated pleasure 

everything looked bright and orderly and attractive when the guests
arrived a little after half past seven  the fire snapped and the candles
shone  a feeling of hospitable warmth was in the air  milly  
arrangements  except so far as they regarded her own well being  had
been judicious and happy  the pretty girls in their short sleeved blue
and crimson merinos  with roses and geranium leaves in their hair  i
need not say that this was at a far back and old fashioned date   looked
every whit as charming as the girls of to day in their more elaborate
costumes 

cousin mary kendal  who  for all her grown up sons and daughters liked
fun as much as any girl among them  had volunteered to play for the
dancing  and the spirit with which she dashed at once into  the caspian
waltz  and  corn rigs are bonny  was enough to set a church steeple to
capering 

everybody seemed in a fair way to have a delightful evening except one
person  that one was poor milly  usually the merriest in every party 
but now dull  spiritless  and inert  she did not even look pretty  color
and sparkle  the chief elements of beauty in her face  were  for the
moment  completely quenched  she was wan and jaded  there were dark
rings under her eyes  and an utter absence of spring to her movements 
usually so quick and buoyant  she sat down whenever she had the chance 
she was silent unless she must speak  half unconsciously she kept a
watch of the clock and was saying to herself   only two hours more and i
can go to bed   her fatigued looks and lack of pleasure were a constant
damper to the animation of the rest  every one noticed  and wondered
what could be the matter  but only janet norcross dared to ask 

 have you got a headache   she whispered  but the  no  which she
received by way of answer sounded so cross that she did not venture on
further inquiries 

 why won   you dance with me   urged will benham   you said you would
when we were talking about the party after the lecture  don   you
remember  

 i   rather the others had the chance  it   my party  you know   replied
milly 

 but they  are  having a chance  everybody is dancing but you  come 
milly  

 oh  will  don   tease   cried milly irritably   i never saw such an
evening  do please to leave me alone and go and ask some of the others  

weariness sharpened her voice  till the words were out of her lips she
had no idea that she was going to speak so petulantly to will  it
sounded dreadfully even to herself 

 oh  certainly   said will with freezing dignity  he crossed the room 
and presently milly saw him take helen jones out to the set of lancers
just forming  he did not look at milly again  or come near her  and the
sense of his displeasure was just the one drop too much  milly felt
herself choke  a hot rush of tears blinded her eyes  she turned  and
being fortunately near the door  got out of it and upstairs without
suffering her face to be seen 

janet found her half an hour later lying prone across the bed  and
sobbing as if her heart would break 

 what  is  the matter   she cried in alarm   are you ill  dear milly 
has anything dreadful happened  i came up to look for you  will benham
got worried because you were away so long  and came to me to ask what
had become of you  i told him i guessed you were taking out the
ice creams  but katy said you hadn   been in the kitchen at all  so i
came up here  what is the matter  do tell me  

 oh  nothing is the matter at all  except that i am a perfect idiot  and
so tired that i wish i were dead   said milly   it was awfully good of
will to care  for i spoke so crossly to him  you can   think  it was
horrid of me  but somehow i felt so dreadfully tired that the words
seemed to jump out of my mouth against my will  dear janet  and i was
cross to you  too   added milly penitently   everything has gone wrong
with me to night  oh  and there is that horrible ice cream  i must go
and get it out of the freezers  but my back aches so  janet  and the
soles of my feet burn like fire  

 you poor thing  you are just tired out   said her friend   no wonder 
you must have worked like a horse to make everything so nice and pretty
as it is  don   worry about the ice cream  just tell me what dishes to
put it in  and i ll see to it  it won   take five minutes  but do rouse
yourself now  and keep up a little while longer  the others will wonder
so if you don   go down  you  must  go down  you know  here is a wet
towel for your eyes  and i ll smooth your hair  

even so small a lift as having the ice cream taken out for her was a
relief  and janet   kindness  and the sense that will was not hopelessly
alienated by her misconduct  helped milly to recover her equilibrium 
soothed and comforted she went downstairs  and got through the rest of
the evening tolerably well 

but when the last good night had been said  and the last sleigh bell had
jingled away from the door  she found herself too tired to rest  all
night long she tossed restlessly on her hot pillows  while visions of
pounding ice and stirring cake  of will   anger  and janet   surprise
when she found her in tears  whirled through her thoughts  when morning
came she was so  poorly  that the doctor was sent for 

 too much party  no doubt   was his inward commentary when he received
the summons  and his first words to milly were   well  missy  so you are
down with fruit cake and mottoes  are you  

 oh  doctor  no  i never ate a mouthful of the cake  i only made it  
was poor milly   disclaimer 

 that sounds serious   said the doctor  but when he had felt her pulse
he looked graver 

 you ve done a good deal too much of something  that is evident   he
said   i shall have to keep you in bed awhile to pay you for it  

milly was forced to submit  she stayed in bed for a whole week and the
greater part of another  missing thereby two candy pulls on which her
heart was set  and the best sleighing frolic of the season  everybody
was kind about coming to see her  and sending her flowers and nice
things  and janet  in particular  spent whole hours with her every day 

 the whole thing seems such a dreadful pity   milly said one day  she
was really better now  able to sit up  and equal to a calm discussion of
her woes   i had looked forward so much to my party  and i wanted to
have it as nice as could be  and i worked so hard  and then  when the
time came  i didn   enjoy it a bit  if i could only have it over again
now when i am all rested and fresh  i should have as good a time as
anybody  doesn   it seem a pity  janet  

 yes  it does   replied janet  after which she fell into a little
musing fit 

 one can   have company without taking some trouble   she said at last 
 but i wonder if one need take so much  

 i don   see what else i could have done   said milly   you must give
people nice things when they come to see you  and somebody has got to
make them  and besides that  there is so much to see to about the
house   dusting  and washing china  and making the rooms nice  

 i know   went on janet reflectively   mrs  beers half killed herself  i
remember  when she had that quilting two years ago  in giving the whole
house a thorough house cleaning beforehand  she said as like as not
somebody would want to run up into the garret chamber after something 
and she should have a fit if it wasn   in order  and after all  not a
soul went anywhere except to the parlor and dining room  and into mrs 
beers   bedroom to take off their things  so the fuss was all thrown
away  and mrs  beers had inflammation of the lungs afterward  and almost
died  

 i recollect  but then they might have gone to the attic  she couldn  
tell  it was natural that mrs  beers should think of it  

 well  and suppose they had  and that there had been a trifle of dust on
the top of some old trunk  what difference would it have made  people
who are busy enjoying themselves don   stop to notice every little
thing  i am going to think the thing over  milly  it   all wrong
somehow  

janet herself was meditating a party  her father had given permission 
and aunt esther  who managed the housekeeping  was only too glad to fall
in with any plan which pleased janet  judge norcross was the richest man
on the hill  there was no reason why janet   entertainment should not
out shine milly    in fact  she had felt a little ambitious to have it
do so  and had made certain plans in her private mind all of which
involved labor and trouble  but now she hesitated 

 if i   going to be as tired out as milly was  and not enjoy it  what  
the use of having a party at all   she said to herself   i    like  to
have it as nice as hers  but whatever i have  i have got to do it all
myself  i   not as strong as milly  i know  and it has half killed
 her   perhaps it would quite kill me  a party isn   worth that  

she discussed the matter within herself  reasonably  she  could  wind
herself up and make eight kinds of cake if she liked  there were the
recipes and the materials and she knew how  moreover  aunt esther would
help her  she could have as much jelly and syllabub and blanc mange as
milly  she could turn the house upside down if she desired  and trim and
beautify and adorn  it was a temptation  no girl likes to be outdone 
least of all by her intimate friend   but is it worth while   janet
queried  and i think she proved herself possessed of a very  level head 
when  at last  she decided that it was not 

 i ll be sensible for once   she told herself   a party is not a duty 
it is a pleasure  if i get so tired that i spoil my own pleasure  i
spoil my company   too  for they will be sure to find it out just as
they did at milly    i couldn   half enjoy anything that night  because
she looked so miserable  and i won   run the risk of having the same
thing happen at our house  i ll just do what is necessary  and leave off
the extras  

the  necessary   when janet came to analyze it  proved to be quite as
much as she was able to undertake  for  as she had admitted to herself 
she was not nearly so strong as milly grace  it meant an ample supply of
two sorts of cake  freshly made and delicate  with plenty of ice cream 
salad  scalloped oysters  and rolls  there was extra china to wash  the
table to set  and the rooms to dust and arrange  and janet was quite
tired enough before it was done  she sent to boston for some preserved
ginger to take the place of the jelly which she didn   make  she made no
attempt at evergreen wreaths  and she wisely concluded that rooms in
their usual state of cleanliness would pass muster with young people
intent on dancing and amusement  that no one would find time to peep
into holes and corners  and that the house could wait to have its
 thorough cleaning  administered gradually after the occasion was over 

there was really a great deal of steady good sense in holding to this
view of the matter  and janet found her reward in the end  the
preparations  even thus simplified  taxed her strength  the extra
touches which she had omitted would have been just the  straw too much  
she gave herself a good margin for rest on the afternoon preceding the
party  and when she came downstairs in her pretty dress of pale blue
cashmere and swan   down  ready to meet her guests  her cheeks and eyes
were as bright as usual  and her spirits were ready for the exhilaration
of excitement 

the tone of any gathering depends in great measure on its hostess  if
she is depressed or under the weather  her visitors are pretty sure to
catch her mood and be affected by it  janet   sunny looks and gay laughs
set the key note of her party  nobody missed the wine jelly or the six
absent sorts of cake  no one wasted a thought on the evergreen wreaths 
all was fun and merriment  and nothing seemed wanting to the occasion 

 what a good time we  have  had   said helen jones to alice ware as they
stood at the door of the dressing room waiting for their escorts   it  
been ever so much jollier than it was at milly    and i can   think
why  that was a beautiful party  but somehow people seemed to feel
dull   helen had no idea of being overheard  but as it happened milly
was nearer to her than she thought 

 i ll tell you why it was  helen   she said  coming forward frankly 
 don   look so shocked  i know you didn   mean me to hear  but indeed i
don   mind a bit  and it   quite true besides  janet   party has been a
great deal nicer  and it   because i was such a goose about mine  i did
a great deal too much and got dreadfully tired  so tired that i couldn  
enjoy it  and you all found it out of course  so you couldn   enjoy it
either  i   sure i don   wonder  but it was all my own fault  janet took
warning by my experience and made her party easier  and you see how nice
it has been  we have all had a beautiful time  and so has she 
well  i ve learned a lesson by it  next time i give a party i shall just
do what i can to make it pleasant for you all  and not what i can    and
i hope it will turn out better for everybody concerned  




the pink sweetmeat 


only three pairs of stockings were left in the shop  it was a very
little shop indeed  scarcely larger than a stall  job tuke  to whom it
belonged  was not rich enough to indulge in the buying of any
superfluous wares  every spring he laid in a dozen dozen of thin
stockings  a bale of cheap handkerchiefs  a gross of black buttons  a
gross of white  a little stationery  and a few other small commodities 
in the autumn he added a dozen dozen of thick stockings  and a box full
of mittens and knitted comforters  besides these he sold penny papers 
and home made yeast made by mrs  tuke  if the stock of wearables grew
scant toward midwinter  job rejoiced in his heart  but by no means made
haste to replenish it  he just laid aside the money needed for the
spring outfit  and lived on what remained  thus it went year after year 
trade was sometimes a little better  sometimes a little worse  but
whichever way it was  job grew no richer  he and his old wife lived
along somehow without coming on the parish for support  and with this
very moderate amount of prosperity they were content 

this year of which i write  the supply of winter stockings had given out
earlier than usual  the weather had been uncommonly cold since october 
which may have been the reason  certain it is  that here at michaelmas 
with december not yet come in  only three pairs of stockings were left
in the little shop  job tuke had told his wife only the week before that
he almost thought he should be forced to lay in a few dozen more  folks
seemed so eager to get  em  but since he said that  no one had asked for
stockings  as it happened  and job  thinking that trade was  after all 
pretty well over for the season  had given up the idea of replenishing
his stock 

one of the three pairs of stockings was a big pair of dark mixed gray 
one pair  a little smaller  was white  and the third  smaller still and
dark blue in color  was about the size for a child of seven or eight
years old 

job tuke had put up the shutters for the night and had gone to bed  the
stockings were talking together in the quiet darkness  as stockings will
when left alone  one pair had been hung in the window  it had got down
from its nail  and was now straddling carelessly with one leg on either
side of the edge of the box in which the others lay  as a boy might on
the top of a stile  this was the big gray pair 

 our chances seem to be getting slim   he said gloomily 

 that is more than you seem   replied the white stockings  in a tart
voice   your ankles are as thick as ever  and your mesh looks to me
coarser than usual to night  

 there are worse things in the world than thickness   retorted the gray
stockings angrily   i   useful  at any rate  i am  while you have no
wear in you  i should say that you would come to darning about the
second wash  if not sooner  

 is that my fault   said the white pair  beginning to cry 

 no  it   your misfortune  but people as unfortunate as you are should
mind their     and      and not say disagreeable things to those who
are better off  

 pray don   quarrel   put in the little blues  who were always
peacemakers   think of our situation  the last survivors of twelve
dozen  we ought to be friends  but  as you say  matters  are  getting
serious with us  of course we are all thinking about the same thing  

 yes  about the christmas  and the chimney corner   sighed the white
pair   what a dreadful thing it would be if we went to the rag bag never
having held a christmas gift  i could not get over such a disgrace  my
father  my grandfather  all my relations had their chance  some of them
were even hung a second time  

 yes  christmas is woven into our very substance   said the gray
stockings   the old skeins and the ravellings tell the story to the new
wool   the story of the christmas time  the very sheep in the fields
know it  for my part   he added proudly   i should blush to lie in the
same ash heap even with an odd stocking who had died under the disgrace
of never being hung up for christmas  and i will never believe that my
life long dream is to be disappointed  

 why will you use such inflated language   snapped the white pair   you
were only woven last july  as late as may you were running round the
meadow on a sheep   back  

 very well  i don   dispute it  i may not be as old as methuselah  but
long or short  my life is my life  and my dream is my dream  and you
have no call to criticise my expressions  miss   thundered the big pair 

 there you are again   said the little blues   i  do  wish you wouldn  
dispute  now let us talk about our chances  what day of the month is
it  

 the twenty seventh of november   said the gray stockings  who  because
they hung over the penny papers in the window  always knew the exact
date 

 little more than four weeks to the holidays   said the white pair
dolorously   how i wish some one would come along and put us out of
suspense  

 being bought mightn   do that   suggested the little blues   you might
be taken by a person who had two pairs of stockings  and the others
might be chosen to be hung up  such things do happen  

 oh  they wouldn   happen to me  i think   said the white pair
vaingloriously 

as it happened  the three pairs of stockings were all sold the very day
after this conversation  and all to one and the same person  this was
mrs  wendte  an englishwoman married to a dutch shipwright  she had
lived in holland for some years after her marriage  but now she and her
husband lived in london  they had three children 

the stockings were very much pleased to be bought  when job tuke rolled
them up in paper and tied a stout packthread round them  they nestled
close  and squeezed each other with satisfaction  besides  the joy of
being sold was the joy of keeping together and knowing about each
other   adventures 

the first of these adventures was not very exciting  it consisted in
being laid away in the back part of a bureau drawer  and carefully
locked in 

 now  what is this for   questioned the white stockings   are we to stay
here always  

 yes  that is just what i should like to know   grumbled the big grays 

 why  of course not  who ever heard of stockings being put away for
always   said the wise little blues   wait patiently and we shall see  i
think it is some sort of a surprise  

but day after day passed and nothing happened  surprising or otherwise 
till even the philosophical little blue stockings began to lose heart
and hope  at last  one evening they heard the key click in the lock of
the drawer  a stream of light flashed into their darkness  and they were
seized and drawn forth 

 well  mother  let us see thy purchase  truly fine hosen they are   said
jacob wendte  whose english was rather foreign 

 yes   replied his wife   good  handsome stockings they are  and the
children will be glad  for their old ones are about worn out  the big
pair is for wilhelm  as thou knowest  those must hang to the right of
the stove  

the big gray pair cast a triumphant glance at his companions as he found
himself suspended on a stout nail  this  was  something like life 

 the white are for greta  and these small ones for little jan  ah  they
are nice gifts indeed   said mrs  wendte  rubbing her hands   a fine
christmas they will be for the children  

the stockings glowed with pleasure  not only were they hung up to
contain presents  but they themselves were christmas gifts  this was
promotion indeed 

 hast thou naught else   demanded jacob wendte of his wife 

 no great things  a kerchief for greta  this comforter for wilhelm  for
the little one  mittens  that is all  

but it was not quite all  for after her husband had gone to bed  mrs 
wendte  a tender look on her motherly face  sought out a small 
screwed up paper  and with the air of one who is a little ashamed of
what she is doing  dropped into each stocking a something made of sugar 
they were not sugar almonds  they were not salem gibraltars   which
delightful confections are unfamiliar to london shops   but irregular
lumps of a nondescript character  which were crumbly and sweet  and
would be sure to please those who did not often get a taste of candy  it
was of little jan that his mother had thought when she bought the
sweetmeats  and for his sake she had yielded to the temptation  though
she looked upon it as an extravagance  there were three of the
sweetmeats  two white  one pink  and the pink one went into jan  
stockings  mrs  wendte had not said anything about them to her husband 

 well  this is satisfactory   said the gray pair  when mrs  wendte had
left the room  and he was sure of not being overheard   here we are all
hanging together on christmas eve  my dream is accomplished  

 mine isn     said the white pair plaintively   i always hoped that i
should hold something valuable  like a watch or a pair of earrings  it
is rather a come down to have nothing but a bit of candy inside  and a
pocket handkerchief pinned to my leg  i don   half like it  it gives me
an uncomfortable pricking sensation  like a stitch in the side  

 it   just as well for you to get used to it   put in the gray   it
doesn   prick as much as a darning needle  i fancy  and you ll have to
get accustomed to that before long  as i ve remarked before  

 i   the only one who has a pink sweetmeat   said the little blues  who
couldn   help being pleased   and i   for a real child  wilhelm and
greta are more than half grown up  

 real children are very hard on their stockings  i ve always heard  
retorted the white pair  who never could resist the temptation to say a
disagreeable thing 

 that may be  but it is all in the future  this one night is my own  and
i mean to enjoy it   replied the contented little blues 

so the night went  and now it was the dawn of christmas  with the first
light the door opened softly and a little boy crept into the room  this
was jan  when he saw the three pairs of stockings hanging by the stove 
he clapped his hands together  but softly  lest the noise should wake
the others  then he crossed the room on tiptoe and looked hard at the
stockings  he soon made sure which pair was for himself  but he did not
take them down immediately  only stood with his hands behind his back
and gazed at them with two large  pleased eyes 

at last he put his hand up and gently touched the three  felt the little
blue pair  gave it a pat  and finally unhooked it from its nail  then he
sat down on the floor  and began to put them on  his toe encountering an
obstacle  he pulled the stocking off again  put his hand in  and
extracted the pink sweetmeat  with which he was so pleased that he
laughed aloud  that woke up the others  who presently came in 

 ah  little rogue that thou art  always the first to waken   said his
mother  pleased at his pleasure 

 see  mother  see what i found   he cried   it is good  sweet  i have
tasted a crumb already  take some of it  mother  

but mrs  wendte shook her head 

 no   she said   i do not care for sugar  that is for little folks like
thee  eat it thyself  jan  

it was her saying this  perhaps  which prevented wilhelm and greta from
making the same offer   at least  i hope so  certain it is that neither
of them made it  greta ate hers up on the spot  with the frank
greediness of a girl of twelve who does not often get candy  wilhelm
buttoned his up in his trousers pocket  all three made haste to put on
the new stockings  the three pairs had only time to hastily whisper as
they were separated   

 to night perhaps we may meet again  

the pink sweetmeat went into the pocket of jan   jacket  and he carried
it about with him all the morning  he did not eat it  because once eaten
it would be gone  and it was a greater pleasure to have it to look
forward to  than to enjoy it at the moment  jan was a thrifty little
boy  as you perceive 

being christmas  it was of course an idle day  jacob wendte never knew
what to do with such  there was his pipe  and there was beer to be had 
so in default of other occupation  he amused himself with these  mrs 
wendte had her hands full with the dinner  and was frying sausages and
mixing yorkshire pudding all the morning  only greta went to church  she
belonged to a parish school where they gave christmas prizes  and by no
means intended to lose her chance  but  apart from that  she really
loved church going  for she spoke english and understood it better than
either of the other children  wilhelm went off on errands of his own 
little jan spent the morning in admiring his stockings  and in wrapping
and unwrapping his precious sweetmeat  and taking it out of his pocket
and putting it in again 

 why dost thou not eat it  dear   asked his mother  as she lifted the
frying pan from the stove 

but he answered   oh  not yet  when once it is eaten  it is over  i will
wait  

 how long wilt thou wait   she asked 

jan said bashfully   i don   know  

in truth  he had not made up his mind about the sweetmeat  only he felt
instinctively that he did not want to hurry  and shorten his pleasure 

dinner over  he went out for a walk  every now and then  as he marched
along  his hand would steal into his pocket to finger his precious candy
and make sure that it was safe 

it was a gray afternoon  but not snowing or raining  hyde park was not
too far away for a walk  and jan went there  the serpentine was skimmed
over with ice just strong enough to bear boys  and quite a little crowd
was sliding or skating upon it  jan could skate very well  he had
learned in holland  but he made no attempt to join the crowd  he was
rather shy of english boys  for they sometimes laughed at his hollander
clothes or his dutch accent  and he did not like to be laughed at 

so he strolled away  past the serpentine and the skaters  and watched
the riders in the row for a while  there were not a great many  for
people who ride are apt to be out of london at the christmas time  but
there were some pretty horses  and one fair little girl on a pony who
took jan   fancy very much  he stood for a long time watching her trot
up and down  and the idea occurred to him that he would like to give her
his sweetmeat  he even put his hand into his pocket and half pulled it
out  but the little girl did not look his way  and presently her father 
with whom she was riding  spoke to her  and she turned her horse   head
and trotted off through the marble arch  jan dropped the sugarplum again
into his pocket  and felt as if his sudden fancy had been absurd  and
indeed i think the little girl would have been surprised and puzzled
what to do had he carried out the intention 

after the pony and his little mistress had departed  jan lost his
interest in the riders  and walked away across the park  once he stopped
to look at a dear little dog with a blue collar  who seemed to have lost
his master  for he was wandering about by himself  and smelling
everybody and everything he met  as if to recover a lost trail  jan
called him  he came up in a very friendly way and allowed himself to be
patted  and once more the sweetmeat was in danger  for jan had taken it
out with the intention of dividing it with this new friend  when a
whistle was heard which the little dog evidently recognized  and he
darted off at once to join his master  so again the pink sweetmeat was
put back into jan   pocket  and he walked on 

he had gone quite a distance when he saw a number of people collected
round the foot of a tree  a ladder was set against one of the lower
branches  and a man had climbed up nearly to the top of the tree  jan 
like a true boy  lost no time in joining the crowd  but at first he
could not make out what was going on  the boughs were thick  all that he
could see was the man   back high up overhead  and what he was doing he
could not guess 

a benevolent looking old gentleman stood near  and jan heard him exclaim
with great excitement 

 there  he   got him  no  he   not  but it was a close shave  

 got what  sir   he ventured to ask 

 why  the rook  to be sure  

then  seeing that jan still looked puzzled  he took the trouble to
explain 

 you see that rook up there  my lad  don   you   jan had not seen any
rook at all   well it is caught in some way  how  i can   tell you  but
it can   get away from the tree  it has been there three days  they
say  and all that time the other rooks have brought food to it  and kept
it from starving  now some one has gone up to see what is the
difficulty  and  if possible  to set the poor thing free  

 thank you  sir   said jan 

and the old gentleman looked at him kindly  and said to himself   

 a very civil  tidy little lad  i like his face  

jan had now become deeply interested in what was going on  he stood on
tiptoe  and stretched his neck  but all he could see was the man   back
and one of his feet  and now and then the movement of a stick with which
the man seemed to be trying to hit something  at last there was a great
plunge and a rustling of branches  and people began to hurrah  jan
hurrahed too  though he still saw nothing very clearly  but it is easier
to shout when other boys shout  if you happen to be a boy  than it is to
keep still 

slowly the man in the tree began to come down  he had only one hand to
help himself with now  for the other held the heavy rook  we in america
do not know what rooks are like  but in england they are common enough 
they are large black birds  something like our crows  but they look
wiser  and are a good deal bigger 

as the man neared the ground  every one in the crowd could see what had
been the matter with the rook  a kite string  caught among the tree
branches  had tangled his legs and held him fast  he had pulled so hard
in his efforts to escape that the string had cut into one of his legs
and half broken it  it was stiff and bleeding  and the rook could
neither fly nor hop  people searched in their pockets  and one little
girl  who had a half biscuit  began to feed the rook  who  for all the
kindly efforts of his friends  seemed to be half famished  the poor
thing was too weak to struggle or be frightened  and took the crumbs
eagerly from the girl   hand 

jan thought of his sweetmeat  and took it out for the third time 
everybody was crowding round the man who held the rook  and he could not
get near  a very tall policeman stood in front of him  jan pulled his
arm  and when he turned  handed him the sweetmeat  and said in his soft
foreign english   

 for the bird  sir  

 thank you  my dear   said the policeman 

he had not understood what jan said  and in an abstracted way  with his
eyes still fixed on the rook  he bit the pink sweetmeat in two  and
swallowed half of it at a mouthful  fortunately jan did not see this 
for the policeman   back was turned to him  but observing that the man
made no attempt to go forward  he pulled his sleeve for the second time 
and again said   

 for the bird  i said  sir  

this time the policeman heard  and taking one step forward  he held the
remaining half of the sweetmeat out to the rook  who  having by this
time grown used to being fed  took the offered dainty greedily  jan saw
the last pink crumb vanish into the long beak  but he felt no regret 
his heart had been touched by the suffering of the poor bird  and he was
glad to give what he could to make it forget those painful days in the
tree 

so that was the end of the pink sweetmeat  or not quite the end  the
kind old gentleman to whom jan had spoken  had noticed the little
transaction with the policeman  he was shrewd as well as kind  he
guessed by jan   clothes that he was a working man   son  to whom sweets
were not an every day affair  and the generous act pleased him  so he
put his hand into  his  pocket  pulled out a half crown  and watching
his opportunity  dropped it into jan   pocket  quite empty now that the
sweetmeat was gone  then  with a little chuckle  he walked away  and jan
had no suspicion of what had been done to him 

gradually the crowd dispersed  jan among the rest walking briskly  for
he wanted to get home and tell his mother the story  it was not till
after supper that he discovered the half crown  and then it seemed to
him like a sort of dream  as if fairies had been at work  and turned the
pink sweetmeat into a bit of silver 

that night the three pairs of stockings had another chance for
conversation  the blue ones and the gray ones lay close together on the
floor of the room where jan slept with his brother  and the white ones 
which greta had carelessly dropped as she jumped into bed  were near
enough the half opened door to talk across the sill 

 it has been an exciting day   said the white pair   my girl got a
keble    christian year  at her school  it was the second best prize  it
is a good thing to belong to respectable people who take prizes  only
one thing was painful to me  she wriggled her toes so with pleasure that
i feel as if i were coming to an end in one of my points  

 you probably are   remarked the big gray   yes  now that i examine  i
can see the place  one stitch has parted already  and there is quite a
thin spot  you know i always predicted that you would be in the rag bag
before you knew it  

 oh  don   say such dreadful things   pleaded the little blues   mrs 
wendte will mend her  i am sure  and make her last  what did your girl
do with her sweetmeat  

 ate it up directly  of course  what else should one do with a
sweetmeat   snapped the white pair crossly   oh  dear  my toe feels
dreadfully ever since you said that  quite neuralgic  

 my boy was not so foolish as to eat his sweetmeat   said the big gray
stockings   only girls act in that way  without regard to anything but
their greedy appetites  he traded his with another boy  and he got a
pocket knife for it  three screws  and a harmonica  there  

 was the knife new   asked the blue 

 could the harmonica play any music   demanded the white 

 no  the harmonica is out of order inside somehow  but perhaps my boy
can mend it  and the knife isn   new  quite old  in fact  and its blade
is broken at the end  still  it   a knife  and wilhelm thinks he can
trade it off for something else  and now for your adventures  what did
 your  boy do with his sweetmeat  little blues  did he eat it  or trade
it  

 it is eaten   replied the blue stockings cautiously 

 eaten  then of course he ate it  why don   you speak out  if he ate it 
say so  if he didn    who did  

 well  nobody ate the whole of it  and my boy didn   eat any  it was
divided between two persons  or rather  between one person and  and  a
thing that is not a person  

 bless me  what are you talking about  i never heard anything so absurd
in my life  persons  and things that are not persons   said the white
pair   what do you mean  

 yes  what  do  you mean  what is the use of beating about the bush in
this way   remonstrated the big gray pair   who did eat the sweetmeat 
say plainly  

 half of it was eaten by a policeman  and the other half by a rook  
replied the little blues  in a meek voice 

 ho  ho   roared the gray stockings  while the white pair joined in with
a shrill giggle   that beats all  half by a policeman  and half by a
rook  a fine way to dispose of a christmas sweetmeat  your boy must be a
fool  little blues  

 not a fool at all   said the blue pair indignantly   now just listen to
me  your girl ate hers up at once  and forgot it  your boy traded his
away  and what has he got  a broken knife  and a harmonica that can  
play music  i don   call those worth having  my boy enjoyed his
sweetmeat all day  he had more pleasure in giving it away than if he had
eaten it ten times over  besides  he got half a crown for it  an old
gentleman slipped it into his pocket because he was pleased with his
kind heart  i saw him do it  

 half a crown   ejaculated the white pair  with amazement 

 that  is  something like   admitted the big gray stockings   your boy
did the best of the three  i admit  

the little blues said no more 

presently the others fell asleep  but she lay and watched jan as he
rested peacefully beside his brother  with his wonderful treasure  the
silver coin  clasped tight in his hand  he smiled in his sleep as though
his dreams were pleasant 

 even if he had no half crown  still he would have done the best   she
whispered to herself at last 

then the clock struck twelve  and the day after christmas was begun 




etelka   choice 


etelka lived on the very borders of the fairy country 

it may be that some of you do not believe that there are any such beings
as fairies  in fact  it is not easy to hold to one   faith in them when
one lives in such a country as this of ours  fairies are the shyest of
creatures  shyer than the wood dove  shyer than the glancing dragon fly 
they love silence  seclusion  places where they can sport unseen with no
intruding voice or step to startle them  when man comes they go  and i
put it to you whether it is likely that they can enjoy themselves in the
united states  where every forest with any trees in it worth cutting
down is liable at any moment to be attacked by an army of wood choppers 
where streams are looked upon as  water power   lakes as  water supply  
and ponds as suitable places for the breeding of fish  where distance
is brought near by railroads  and solitudes only mean a chance for a
settler  where people are always poking about the hills and mountains in
search of coal mines or silver mines  and prodding the valleys in hopes
of oil wells  and where silence generally means an invitation to a
steam whistle of one kind or another 

but where etelka lived no one doubted the reality of fairies any more
than they did that of human beings  her home was in bohemia  in the
outskirts of the  boehmer wald   a vast  unpeopled tract of mountainous
country thickly wooded  full of game  and seldom visited except by
hunting parties in pursuit of stags or wild boars  etelka   people were
of mixed sclavonic and gypsy origin  they cultivated a patch of land
under the stewardship of a lord who never came near his estate  but this
was only their ostensible occupation  for poaching or smuggling goods
across the frontier brought in a great deal more money to them than did
farming  there were three sons  marc  jocko  and hanserl  etelka was the
only girl  they were lithe  sinewy young fellows  with the swarthy skins
and glittering black eyes which belonged to their gypsy blood  and
something furtive and threatening in their looks  but she was different 
her hair and eyes were of a warm brown  her features were delicate  and
their expression was wistful and sweet  all summer long she ran about
with her slender feet and ankles bare  a thin little cotton gown and a
bead necklace composed her wardrobe for the warmer months  in winter she
wore woollen stockings and wooden shoes  a stuff petticoat and a little
shawl  she was always shabby  often ragged  and on cold days scarcely
ever warm enough to be comfortable  but she somehow looked pretty in her
poor garments  for beauty is the gift of heaven  and quite as often sent
to huts as to palaces  no one had ever told etelka that she was pretty 
except indeed young sepperl of the mill  whom she had seen now and again
on her semi annual visits to the neighboring village to dispose of her
yarn  and he had said more with his eyes than with his tongue 

to her family it made no difference whatever whether she was pretty or
not  they preferred to have her useful  and they took care that she
should be so  she spun and sewed  she cleaned the pots and pans  cooked
the rye porridge and the cabbage soup  and rarely got a word of thanks
for her pains  her brothers flung her their jackets to mend or their
game to dress  without a word of ceremony  if she had refused or delayed
to attend to their wants she would have got a rough word  a curse  or
perhaps a blow  but etelka never refused  she was a willing little
creature  kindly and cheerful  and had no lazy blood in her veins  so
early and late she worked for them all  and her chief  almost her only
pleasure was when  her tasks despatched  she could escape from the hut
with its atmosphere of smoke and toil  and get away into the forest by
herself 

when once the green and fragrant hush of the high arched thickets closed
her in  she would give a sigh of relief  and a sense of being at home
took possession of her  she did not feel it in the hut  though she
called that home  and it was the only one she had ever known 

did etelka believe in fairies  indeed she did  she had a whole volume of
stories about them at her tongue   end  her great grandmother had seen
them often  so had her great aunt  the mother of dame gretel  the wise
woman of the village  who herself passed for a witch  had been on
intimate terms for a long time with a hoary little kobold who had
taught her all manner of marvellous things  the same fortunate woman had
once seen rubesal  the mountain demon  and had left an account of him
and his looks  which were exactly those of a charcoal burner  etelka
knew the very hollow where dame gretel   mother used to sit and listen
to the teachings of the kobold  and could point out the ring where a
number of the  good people  had once been seen moving a mystic dance 
their wings glancing in the darkness like fire flies  she  herself  had
never seen a fairy or a kobold  it is true  everybody was not thus
fortunate  but she might some day  who knew  and meantime she had often
heard them whispering and sighing in their odd little voices close
beside her  you may be sure that etelka believed in fairies  it was one
reason why she liked so well to go to the great forest  which was their
well known abiding place 

one day the desire to escape from home was unusually strong upon her 
her mother was out of sorts for some reason and had been particularly
harsh  her father  who sometimes stood her friend  had gone to the
village with a bundle of hare skins which he hoped to trade for oil and
brandy  her brothers  who had some private expedition on foot  had kept
her running since early morning  she had grown tired and a little cross
at their many exactions  and when  finally  all was made ready  and they
set out with their guns and snares and a knapsack full of food  and her
mother  sitting with her pipe beside the fire  had fallen into a doze 
etelka gladly closed the door behind her and stole away  the soup was
simmering in its pot  the bowls were ready set on the table  she would
not be missed  for an hour or two she might feel that she belonged to
herself 

the forest felt deliciously cool and still as she walked fast up the
little glade which led to the fairy spring  this was a small pool of
clear water  bubbling strongly up from a sandy bottom  and curiously
walled round with smooth stones  which seemed fitted and joined by the
labor of man  though in reality they were a freak of nature 

etelka sat herself down on this stony rim  dipped her hands in the water
and sprinkled a little on her hot forehead  a tall spear of feathery
grass grew just by  presently it began to bend and sway as if
wind blown  and dance lightly up and down before her face  she took no
notice at first  then it occurred to her  as no wind was blowing
anywhere else  it was odd that this particular grass blade should be in
such active motion 

 how queer   she said  looking hard at the grass blade   it seems to be
alive  

a shrill  small laugh echoed her words  and suddenly  as if her eyes had
been magically opened to see  she became aware that a tiny shape in
green  with a pointed cap on its head  was sitting upon the blade of
grass and moving it to and fro with hand and foot  the little
countenance under the cap was full of mischief and malice  and the
bright eyes regarded her with a strange glee  etelka knew instantly that
her wish had come true  and that at last she was face to face with a
veritable fairy 

 oh   was all she could say in her amazement 

 well  stupid  do you know who i am   asked the creature in a voice as
shrill as its laugh 

 yes  mein herr   faltered etelka 

 here you have gone about all your days wishing you could see a fairy  
continued the small creature   and there we were close by all the time 
and you never opened your eyes to look  how do you like me now you do
see me  

 very much  herr fairy   replied etelka  gaining courage   i think you
are beautiful  

the fairy seemed pleased at this compliment  which was evidently
sincere 

 thou art a good maiden enough  as maidens go   he said  accosting her
more familiarly   i have long had my eye on thee  etelklein  i have sat
up in the roof thatch and heard jocko and hanserl scold and hector  and
the mother order thee about  and i have noted that thou wast almost
always kind and humble  and seldom answered them back again  thou art
neat handed  too  and that we fairies think much of  many a drink of
good new milk have i had  which i should have missed hadst thou
forgotten to scour the pail  so now in return i will do something for
thee  listen 

 thou must know that each fairy of the  boehmer wald  has the privilege
once every hundred years of granting one wish to a mortal  all do not
exercise it  some crabbed ones do not like the human folk enough to be
willing to do them a good turn  others again are too lazy or too
pleasure loving to go out of their way for the purpose  i am neither of
these  now  hearken  i will give thee the power that every time thou
dancest a piece of gold shall lie under thy foot  or  instead of the
gold  a flower shall spring up out of the ground  which wilt thou have  

 yes  which wilt thou have   cried another sharp voice  and a second
fairy appeared  out of the air as it were  and seated himself on the
very tip of the grass blade   don   be in a hurry  think a bit before
you choose  etelka  why  child  what are you looking so scared about  

for etelka had grown pale  and had not been able to repress a little
scream at this sudden apparition  she rallied her courage and tried to
look brave  but her heart misgave her  was the wood full of these unseen
creatures 

 it is only my gossip   explained fairy number one   thimblerig is his
name  mine is pertzal  he usually comes after me wherever i go  you
needn   be afraid of  him   now  gold piece or flower  decide  

etelka was in a whirl of confusion  it was dreadful to have to make up
her mind all in a moment about such an important thing  her thoughts
flew to sepperl of the mill  he was fond of flowers  she knew  the mill
garden was always full of blue flax  poppies  and lavender  and sepperl
spent all his spare hours in working over it  suppose  suppose  the
thing over which she had sometimes shyly glowed and blushed were to
happen  how pleasant it would be to dance flowers all day long for
sepperl 

then her mind reverted to the hut  to her mother and the boys  who were
always craving after the luxuries of life which they could not have  and
fiercely envying those who were better off than themselves  would they
not be happier and better and kinder for the gold which she had it in
her power to give them  they would not forgive her if she lost such a
chance  that she knew  and even so far as sepperl went  gold never came
amiss to a poor man   door  so many things could be bought with it 

 one cannot eat flowers   said etelka to herself with a sigh  yet still
she hesitated  and her heart felt heavy within her 

 choose   repeated the two fairies  each echoing the other 

 i choose the gold piece   said etelka  the fairy faces clouded over as
she spoke  and she knew she had chosen wrong 

 very well   said pertzal   have thy wish   he vanished as he spoke 
etelka sat alone by the bubbling spring  and she rubbed her eyes and
asked herself if it were not all a dream 

 i will put it to the test   she thought  and jumping up she began to
dance beneath the trees  slowly and doubtfully at first  and then with
swift and joyful bounds and steps  for as she danced  ever and anon upon
the ground beneath her feet appeared a glittering coin  she danced so
long that when at last she ceased she sank down exhausted  the beautiful
yellow pieces lay thickly around her  some larger  some smaller  as if
their size depended upon the vigor of her movements  she had never
dreamed of such wealth before  and she gathered them up and tied them in
the corner of her shawl  half fearing they might turn to brass or
pebbles  but when she neared home and looked at them again they were
still gold 

her mother was standing at the door with a black look on her face 

 where hast thou been  thou idle baggage   she demanded   i drop asleep
for one moment  and when i wake the fire is well nigh out  

etelka glanced at the setting sun  in her excitement she had not marked
the flight of time  it was much later than she had supposed 

 i am sorry   she faltered  then  to appease her mother   anger  she
untied the corner of her shawl and showed the fairy money 

 see what i have brought   she said   they are all for thee  

the old woman fairly gasped in her surprise 

 gold   she cried  clutching the coins which etelka held out   real
gold  more than i ever saw before  where didst get it  girl  who gave it
thee  

 the fairies   exclaimed etelka joyfully   and they taught me how to get
more when we are again in need  

 do you dare to make a mock of me   screamed her mother  aiming a blow
at her with the staff which she held in her hand   fairies indeed  a
fine story  tell the truth  hussy  didst thou meet some count in the
forest  or the landgrave himself  

 i met nobody   persisted etelka   no one at all except the fairy and
the other fairy  and it was they who gave me the gift  

her mother   staff descended with a whack on her shoulder 

 get thee in   she said harshly   thou are lying   but she held fast to
the gold all the same  and when etelka   back was turned she hid it
secretly away 

so the first fruit of the fairy gift was a blow 

later  when the father came back from the village  there was another
scene of severity and suspicion  neither of etelka   parents believed
her story  they treated her like a culprit who will not confess his
guilt  it was worse yet when her brothers returned the following day  in
vain she wept and protested  in vain she implored them to believe her 

 it   easy enough to talk   jocko declared at last   but to prove thy
words is not so easy  if thou hast the power to dance gold pieces into
existence  why  face to work and dance  then we shall know whether or
not to believe thee  

strange to say  this method of proving her veracity had not occurred to
etelka   mind  after her troubled sleep and unhappy day she had begun
to feel that the interview with the fairies was no more than a dream 
and she scarcely ventured on the test  dreading that the strange gift
bestowed upon her might have been withdrawn 

slowly and fearfully she began to dance  while her family watched every
movement with eyes of scornful incredulity  suddenly marc  uttering a
great oath  stooped and picked up something from the hard trodden
earthen floor  it was a gold piece 

 by heavens   he exclaimed   the girl spoke true  or   with a return of
suspicion   is it one of those she gave thee which thou hast dropped  
turning to his mother 

but as etelka  with heart suddenly grown lighter  went on bounding and
twirling  one shining coin after another shone out on the floor beneath
her feet  and with howls and screams of joy her relatives precipitated
themselves upon them  it seemed as if they could never have enough  if
etelka paused to rest they urged her on 

 dance thou   they cried   dance  etelklein  liebchen  susschen 
darling of our hearts  do not stop  keep on till we are all rich  

one hour  two  passed  and still etelka obeyed their eager behest and
danced on  the boys  pockets  her father   pouch  her mother   lap were
full  and yet they demanded more 

at last  quite worn out  she sank in a heap on the ground 

 i cannot take another step   she sighed 

 oh  well   jocko reluctantly admitted   that may do for to night 
to morrrow we will have some more of it  

from that day all was changed for the family in the forest hut  every
one  except etelka  fell to work straightway to squander the fairy gold 
the sons made expeditions to the distant town  and came back laden with
goods of the most incongruous kinds   silks  velvets  tobacco 
gold embroidered caps  bonbons  carved pipes  gayly painted china  gilt
clocks  toys of all descriptions  anything and everything which had
pleased their untutored fancy  the father and mother smoked all day
long  till the air of the hut was dense and stifling  brandy and
 kirsch wasser  flowed in streams  etelka alone profited nothing from
the fairy gift  to be sure she had her share of the dainties which the
others devoured  and her brothers now and then tossed her a ribbon or a
brightly colored handkerchief  but for these she did not much care  and
her liberty  for which she did care  was greatly abridged  no longer was
she suffered to wander at will in the forest  she had become too
precious for that  something might happen to her  they all declared  a
bear or a wolf might come along and attack her  or she might slip and
sprain her ankle  which  so far as they were concerned  would be just as
bad  no  etelka must run no risks  she must stay at home  and be ready
to dance for them whenever they needed her 

the slender limbs grew very weary  and the heart which gave them life
was often heavy  as time went on  and more and more gold was needed to
satisfy the exactions of her family  money easily won is still more
easily spent  the fairy gold melted fast in the rapacious fingers which
clutched it  soon  for appetite grows by what it feeds upon  the little
hut no longer sufficed the growing ambition of etelka   brothers  it was
too poor  too lonely  too everything  they declared  they must all
remove to budweis or linz  the city was the only fit place for people to
live in who had money to spend 

etelka was not consulted  she was ordered to pack this and that  and to
leave the other behind  that was all  and was made to dance a few extra
hours to pay the travelling expenses  all the homely old furniture was
left in the hut  as not smart enough for the grand city home they were
going to  they took only the things they had bought since their good
luck began  but these filled a great cart  on the top of which etelka
and her mother were perched  she cast one last look toward her beloved
forest  to which she had not been allowed a farewell visit  jocko
cracked his long whip  the oxen slowly moved forward   good by to
everything   said etelka in her heart  but she dared not say it aloud 

a quick pang shot through her as they passed the mill garden  gay with
flowers  where sepperl  hoe in hand  was standing  his eyes met hers
with deep and silent reproach  then were averted  she did not
understand  but it made her very sad  no one had told her that a few
weeks before  sepperl had asked her in marriage of her father  and had
been roughly refused  such an offer would have been looked upon as
unheard of good fortune six months previously  now it was regarded
almost as an insult  marry etelka  take their gold earner away from
them  it was out of the question  what was the fool thinking of  but
etelka heard nothing of all this 

haunted by the recollection of sepperl   wistful glance  she went her
way with the others  little heart had she for the new home which seemed
to them so fine  it was high up in an old building  overlooking a
crowded street  the rooms seemed very large and empty after the forest
hut  and the first care of the family was to furnish them  with reckless
disregard of good taste as well as of expense  marc and jocko and
hanserl rushed away to the market and the shops  and presently the
stairs began to fill with porters bringing up all manner of
things   beds and chairs and tables  gaudy carpets for the floors 
ill painted pictures in showy frames for the walls  a piano on which
none of them knew how to play  a music box of extraordinary size which
could play without assistance  looking glasses  lamps  wonderful china
figures  a parrot in a gilded cage  with a dreadful command of profane
language  the rooms were filled and more than filled in no time  and
for the payment of all these things etelka must dance 

and dance she did  but with a heavy heart and no spring in her feet 
accustomed to the quiet of the forest neighborhood  the sounds and
smells of the city oppressed her greatly  the crowd and bustle
frightened her  the roar of noise kept her awake at night  she felt as
if she could not breathe  things grew worse rather than better  their
extravagance provoked notice  and the fame of their riches and their
ignorance soon brought about them a crew of tempters and needy
adventurers  men with evil eyes and sly greedy faces began to appear at
all hours  to smoke and drink with marc and jocko  to gamble with them
and win their money  much money did they win  and all that was lost
etelka must make good  with her will or without it  she must
dance   dance always to content her rapacious kindred  they could hardly
endure to spare her for the most needful rest  time and again when she
had sunk exhausted on her bed to sleep  while dice rattled and glasses
clinked in the next room  hanserl or jocko had rushed in to awaken her
roughly and demand that she should get up at once and dance  stumbling
and half blind with drowsiness the poor girl would do her best  but her
movements being less brisk and buoyant  the coins would be of smaller
value  and she would be sworn at for her pains  and threatened with dire
penalties if she did not do better next time 

no wonder that under this treatment she grew pale and thin  the pretty
cheeks lost their roundness  the pink faded from them  her eyes were
dull and lustreless  a great homesickness took possession of her  night
and day she pined for the forest hut  so wan and unhappy was she  that
even the hard hearts of those who profited by her should have been
touched by it  but no one noticed her looks or cared that she was
unhappy  so long as she would keep on dancing and coin gold for them 

at last came a day when she could not rise from her bed  marc came and
threatened her  he even pulled her on to her feet  but it was in vain 
she fell down with weakness and could not stand  alarmed at last  jocko
hastened after a doctor  he came  felt etelka   pulse  shook his head 

 what has she been doing   he asked 

nothing  they told him  nothing at all  then he shook his head still
more portentously 

 ah  well  in that case it is all of no use   he said   she is all given
out  she must die  

and now indeed those who had let etelka tire herself to death for them
were thoroughly frightened  with her would perish all their hopes  for
the gold she had earned for them had been spent as fast as made  nothing
had been laid up  they took wonderfully good care of her now  there was
nothing she fancied that they would not willingly have brought her  but
all the poor child asked for was to be left alone and suffered to lie
still  not to be forced to keep on with that weary dancing 

gradually the spent flame of life flickered feebly upward within her 
and as she gained a little in strength  a longing after the forest took
possession of her  the wish seemed utterly foolish to her family  but
they would not refuse it  for their one desire was to have her get well
and able to earn gold for them again  so the big wagon and the oxen were
hired  etelka on her bed was laid carefully in it  marc took the goad 
and slowly  slowly  the sick girl was carried back to her old home 

all was unchanged there  dust lay thickly on the rude furniture which
had been left behind  on the pots and pans which hung upon the wall  but
no one had meddled with them or lifted the latch of the door since the
family went away  the cool hush and stillness of the place was like a
balm to etelka   overstrained nerves  she slept that night as she had
not slept for weeks  and on the morrow was visibly stronger  marc did
not stay with her long  the quiet of the hut disgusted him  and after
enduring it for a day or two he went back to the others in the city 
leaving etelka alone with her father and mother  he gave strict orders
that he was to be sent for the moment that etelka was able to use her
feet again  then  indeed  she must fall to work and dance to make up for
all this wasted time 

poor etelka rejoiced to see him go  she had learned to fear her brothers
and almost to dislike them 

the day after he went  she begged her father to carry her in his arms to
the edge of the forest and lay her under a tree  she wanted to feel the
wind in her face again  she said  he consented at last  though grumbling
a little at the trouble  etelka was comfortably placed on a bear skin
under the shade of a spreading fir  and after a while  as her eyes were
closed and she seemed to be asleep  her father stole away and left her 
she was in full sight of the hut  so there seemed no danger in leaving
her alone 

but etelka was not asleep  she was thinking with all her might  thinking
of the fairy  wishing she could see him again and ask him to undo the
fatal gift which had brought such misery into her life 

suddenly  as she lay thinking these thoughts  her cheek was tickled
sharply  she opened her eyes  there stood the same odd little figure in
green which she had seen before  as then a grass blade was in his hand 
and leaning over his shoulder was his gossip thimblerig  etelka almost
screamed in her joy 

 thou seemest pleased to see us   remarked pertzal with a mocking smile 

 oh  i am glad  indeed i am   cried poor etelka   dear kind herr fairy 
have pity  don   let me dance gold any more  

 what  tired already  what queer creatures mortals be   began pertzal
teasingly  but the kinder thimblerig interposed 

 tired of her gift  of course she is  you knew she would be when you
gave it  gossip  don   plague the poor child  look how thin she has
grown  but  etelka  i must tell thee that when once a fairy has granted
to a mortal his wish  he has no power to take it back again  

 what   cried etelka in despair   must i then go on dancing forever till
i die  

 he cannot take it back   repeated thimblerig   but do not cry so  there
is another way  a second fairy can grant a wish which will contradict
the first  and so all may be made right  now  etelka  i have a kindness
for thee as well as pertzal here  and like him i have the right to grant
a favor to a mortal  now  listen  dance thee never so well or dance thee
never so long  from henceforward shall never gold piece lie under foot
of thine for all thy dancing  and  furthermore  if ever thou art married
to a man whom thou lovest  i endow thee with this gift  that when thou
dancest with will and because thy heart is light  violets and daisies
and all sweet blossoms shall spring at thy tread  till all about thee is
as a garden  

 now i will add this piece of advice   said pertzal  grinning
maliciously   if ever this does happen  hold thy tongue about thy gift
to thy husband  the best of men can hardly resist the temptation of
making money out of their womenkind   safety lies in silence  

 oh  how can i thank you   sighed etelka 

 thank us by being happy   said thimblerig  then the fairies faded from
sight  and etelka was alone 

i have not time to tell of the wrath of etelka   father and mother and
brothers  when  as she grew strong enough to dance again for their
bidding  it was found that no gold pieces followed her light steps  and
that the fairy gift had been withdrawn  their ill humor and discontent
made the life of the hut worse than ever it had been before  etelka sank
into her former insignificance  very willingly and faithfully she worked
for them all  but she could not win them to content  one after another
the boys departed from home  marc enlisted as a soldier  jocko joined a
party of smugglers and disappeared over the italian frontier  hanserl
took service with the charcoal burners high up on the mountains  when
sepperl of the mill asked again for etelka   hand in marriage the
following year  there was no question as to what answer should be given
him  her father was only too glad to say yes  etelka was made happy at
last 

she had been a wife several months before she made trial of her second
fairy gift  it was one evening when she and sepperl were in their
garden  and he was telling her his plans with regard to a bit of waste
land which he had lately fenced in 

 it will take many roots and seeds to make it like the rest   he
remarked   but little by little we can do it without feeling the cost 
and in the end it will be the best of all  

then  with a sudden flash in her eyes  etelka left her husband and began
to dance  to and fro over the bare earth she sped with quick graceful
steps  now advancing  now retreating  now describing circles  with her
arm poised above her head like wings and her laughing eyes fixed on
sepperl  he was puzzled by this freak on the part of his pretty wife 
but stood watching her with great admiration  her cheeks were so
flushed  and her movements so light and dainty 

she stopped at last  came to him  and laid her hand on his arm 

 illustration  then with a sudden flash in her eyes  etelka left her
husband and began to dance    page 202   

 now look   she said 

and lo  where had been bare  brown earth a half hour before  was now a
green sward enamelled all over with buttercups  violets  pink and white
michaelmas daisies  and pansies of every shade of gold and purple 

sepperl stood transfixed   hast thou commerce with the elves   he asked 

but etelka did not reply  the words of pertzal recurred to her memory 
 silence is safety   and they were like a wise hand laid on her lips 
she only laughed like a silver bell  shook her head  and left on
sepperl   cheek a happy kiss 




the fir cones 

an idyl of christmas eve 


 well  the old tree has gone at last   said the farmer  as he latched
the heavy door and began to stamp the snow from his boots 

 what tree   cried a girl   voice  as the whir of the busy wheel
suddenly slackened   oh  father  not the lovers  tree   the old fir 
surely thou canst not mean  that   

 no other  hilda  the lovers  tree  under which thy mother and i
exchanged our troth plight more than twenty years back  hey  dame   and
he turned with a smile to where his wife sat in the sunset light 
humming a low tune to the accompaniment of her clicking needles  she
smiled back in answer 

 yes  paul  and my mother as well  and thine too  i ll be bound  for she
also was a brelau girl  all brelau knows the fir   a hundred years old
it was  they say  

 more than that   said the farmer   my grandfather courted his lass
under its shade  and his father did the same  add a hundred and fifty to
your hundred  and it won   be so far amiss  wife  but it has fallen at
last  there ll be no more maidens wooed and won under the lovers  tree 
thou hast lost thy chance  hilda   and he turned fondly to his girl 

 that was indeed a terrible wind last night   went on the dame   it
rocked the bed till it waked me from my sleep  did it rouse thee also 
liebchen  

but hilda responded neither to word nor look  she had left her wheel 
had crossed the room  and now stood gazing from the window to where
across the valley the green obelisk of the old fir had risen  men were
moving about the spot where once it stood  and the ring of axes on the
frosty air told that already the frugal peasantry were at work  and the
pride of the village  confidant of many secrets  was in process of
reduction to the level of vulgar fire wood 

in rushed two children   hast thou heard the news   they cried   the
lovers  tree is blown down  all the people are up there chopping  may we
go too  and see them chop  we will bring home all the cones to build the
christmas fire  ah  do let us go  mother  fir cones blaze so
magnificently  

 you are such little ones  you will get in the way of the axes and be
hurt   replied their mother  fondling them 

but the farmer said   

 yes  let them go  we will all go  get thy cloak  ursula  and thy
woollen hood  we will see the old tree once more before it is carried
away  wilt thou come too  hilda  

but hilda shook her head  and did not turn or answer  the children
rioted about  searching for baskets and fagot strings  but she neither
moved nor spoke  then the door closed  and all was quiet in the cottage 
but still hilda stood in the window  looking with dreamy  unseeing eyes
across the valley to the opposite hillside 

she was looking upon a picture   a picture which nobody would ever see
again  upon the venerable tree  beloved of all brelau  which for more
years than men could count  had stood there watching the tide of human
life ebb and flow  as some majestic old man might stand with children
playing about his kindly knees  whole generations of lovers had held
tryst under its shade  kisses had been interchanged  vows murmured   the
old  old story of human love  of human joy  of hope  of longing  of
trust  had been repeated and repeated there  age after age  and still
the old tree guarded its secrets well  as in days of greenest youth  and
still bent to listen like a half human friend  white arms clasped its
trunk  soft cheeks were laid there  as if the rough bark could feel
responsive thrill  two centuries of loving and listening had mellowed
its heart  the boughs seemed to whisper meanings to those who sought
their shade   gay songs to the young  counsels to the burdened 
benedictions to those who  bowed down with trouble  came  black clad and
sorrowful  to look across the valley where once the purple lights of
hope had met their eyes   wait   the rustling murmur seemed to say to
such   only wait  wait  as i have waited  and you shall be made
exceedingly glad  behold  the day dawns and the shadows fly away   and
though the heavy heart might not comprehend the whispered words 
something seemed lifted from the weight of sadness  and the mourners
departed comforted  knowing not why 

but not upon a vague picture only did hilda look  german girls can keep
their own counsel as well as girls of other nations  and for all her
father   joking she had not  lost her chance  under the lovers  tree 
often had she sat there  sat there not alone  and now in thought she was
there again  she heard a voice  she leaned to meet a kiss   wilhelm  
she faltered  and then the vision dissolved in a mist of hot and rushing
tears  in the old fir she seemed to lose a friend  an intercessor  oh 
why had this unhappy quarrel arisen  why had she and wilhelm loved at
all  if only to be so unhappy in the end 

but  in truth  it is very easy for lovers to quarrel  like particles of
electric matter  the two natures near  attract  repel  the fire that
leaps from either soul  responsive to kindred fire  fuses or destroys  a
hint  a suspicion  jealousy  mistrust  the thousand and one small
chances of life  come between  and all is over  only  

     the little pitted speck in garnered fruit 

is needful  a trifle  or what seemed a trifle  had been the beginning of
mischief between hilda and wilhelm  but the breach had slowly widened
till now  when for weeks they had neither met nor spoken  and the idyl
begun under summer boughs was withering in time of frost like summer
flowers 

to the old tree  and to him alone  did the girl confide her
wretchedness  in his dumb ear she owned herself in the wrong   why do
you not say so   the responsive murmur seemed to breathe   wilhelm is
true  wilhelm is kind  only a word  and all will be well   but pride
laid his finger on her lips  she neglected the kindly monitor  the word
came not  and now the dear old fir was gone  and thinking of all these
things  hilda   heart was very sad 

meantime upon the hillside a great crowd of people were assembled about
the fallen trunk  old men and women  with wistful eyes  stood there 
comely middle aged pairs  surrounded by children  young girls and their
bachelors  boys with fresh rosy faces and wondering eyes   all alike had
come to see once more the face of the village friend  merrily rang the
axes upon the wood  some looked sad  some merry  as the work went on 
there was much interchange of  do you remembers   much laughing and
joking  a few tears  the children with their baskets ran about picking
up the bright cones which once hung like a coronet upon the forehead of
the fir  here and there a woman stooped for a chip or a small twig to
carry away as relic  and then it began to grow dark  the people
recollected themselves  as people will after doing a sentimental thing 
and saw that it was time to go home  so in contented crowds they
descended the hill to their suppers  and threw billets of the old fir on
the fire  and beside the blaze partook of sausage and cheese  and
laughed and gossiped no less merrily than usual  and the funeral of the
old tree was over 

 we will keep all our cones  and the big fagot which fritz tied up 
until day after to morrow   said little gretchen   because  you know 
day after to morrow comes christmas eve  and the christ child must be
sure to find a good fire  

no one gainsaid this  so the fagot was laid aside 

all next day  and the next  did hilda labor busily  throwing herself
with feverish energy into the christmas preparations  there was a plenty
to do  the furniture must shine its brightest  veal and puddings must be
made ready for spit and oven  green boughs be hung everywhere  and 
above all  the tree must be prepared  hard and continually she worked 
and as the sun set on the blessed eve all was in order  a vast fire
crackled on the hearth of the  big room   thrown open in honor of the
festival  its bright blaze was reflected back from the polished panels
of the tall corner clock  and danced on the rosy apples and glossy
filberts of the still unlighted tree  which stood  green and
magnificent  beyond  little fruit of value did this wonderful tree bear 
jackets  stockings  leather shoes  loaded the lower boughs  above was a
flowering of warm hoods and gay neck cloths  there was a wooden cow for
gretchen  a trumpet of red tin for little paul  but the useful and the
necessary predominated  tender hands had arranged all  had hung the
many colored tapers  crowned the whole with bright berried stems  and 
in the moss at the foot  laid reverently a tiny straw cradle  with waxen
occupant  in memory of that resting place in the bethlehem manger where
once a  young child lay   and now  pale and tired  hilda stood gazing
upon her finished work 

 sister  sister   clamored eager voices through the closed door   hasn  
the christ child come yet  

 no  dears  not yet  go away and play quietly in the kitchen  i ll call
you when he comes  

the little footsteps retreated  and hilda seated herself before the fire
with a weary sigh  it would be an hour or more before her father would
return  and the lighting of the tree begin  so  leaning back in the high
carved chair  she gave herself up to rest of body  leaving her mind to
rove listlessly as it would 

the basket of cones stood beside the hearth  half mechanically she
stooped for a handful  and threw them on the blaze  then a certain
drowsy peace came over her  broken only by the flickering noise of the
burning cones  they did not burn like other cones  she thought  and even
as the idea floated through her brain  a strange  phantasmal change
passed over them  moving and blending  they began to build a picture in
the heart of the fire   the picture of a tree  drawn in flaming lines 
hilda knew the tree  it was the old fir of brelau  complete in limb and
trunk  and  as she gazed  figures formed themselves beneath the
boughs   figures as of people sitting there  which moved and
scintillated  and  swaying toward each other  seemed to clasp and kiss 
she uttered a low cry of pain  at the sound the scene shifted  the tree
dissolved as in fiery rain  and the cones  raising themselves and
climbing upward  stood ranged in a group on the topmost log  like a
choir of musicians about to play  strange notes seemed to come from the
blaze  low and humming  like a whispered prelude  then voices began to
speak  or to sing  which was it   in tones which sounded oddly near  and
yet infinitely far away  it was like a chorus of elves sung to the
accompaniment of rustling leaves  and all the time it went on  certain
brightly flaming cones  which took precedence  emphasized the music with
a succession of quick  glancing sparks  darting out like tiny
finger points  as if to attract attention 

 look at us  look at us   were the words of the strange  staccato  chant
which sounded from the fire   we are all light and glorious as your love
used to be   used to be  it isn   so any longer   then other cones  half
burned and crusted over with white ashes  pushed forward and took up the
strain in sad recitative   look at us  look at us  hilda  we are as your
love is now   is now  ah  there will be worse to come ere long   and all
the time they sang  glowing strongly from within  they fixed what
seemed eyes  red and winking  on hilda   face  then the ashes from
below  drifting upward in an odd  aimless way  formed themselves into a
shadowy shape  and began to sing in low  muffled tones  full of sadness 
 we are dead  hilda   was their song   all dead  dead as your love will
be  will be  before long   and at the close of the strain all the cones
closed together  and emitted a sigh so profound and so melancholy that
hilda started from her chair  tears stood upon her cheeks  she stared at
the fire with strange excitement  it was burning quietly now  and
without noise  she was certainly awake  had she been dreaming 

just at that moment the latch of the door clicked slightly  and somebody
entered  slowly  hesitatingly  propelled from behind by a childish
figure   hilda   said gretchen   voice   here   wilhelm wanting to see
the father  i told him to come in  because  perhaps  the father was
here  or else the mother   and gretchen   eyes explored the room in
search of the christ child  for a glimpse of whom she had resorted to
this transparent device  then  alarmed by hilda   stony silence  she
suddenly hung her head  and  rushing out  clapped the door behind her 
and left the two alone 

hilda gave a gasp of bewilderment  she could not move  was this part of
the vision  wilhelm stole one furtive glance at her face  then dropped
his eyes  for a moment perfect stillness prevailed  then  shifting
uneasily from one leg to the other in his embarrassment  the young man
muttered something undistinguishable  and turned  his hand was on the
door   a moment more and he would be gone  hilda started forward 

 wilhelm   she exclaimed  with the hoarse utterance of one who seeks to
escape from some frightful dream 

wilhelm turned  he saw the pale  agitated face  the eyes brimmed with
tears  the imploring  out stretched hands  another second and he held
her in his arms  the familiar touch melted the ice of hilda   heart  her
head sank upon his breast  and in a few broken words all was spoken and
explained 

so brief an interval and all life changed  the same intense feeling
which drove them asunder drew them as inevitably together now that once
the returning tides had chance to flow  clasped in close embrace  with
tears and smiles and loving self reproachings  they stood before the
fire  and as they bent for their first reconciled kiss  the fir cones 
flashing once more into life and activity  rose upon the topmost log 
even the burned and blackened ones glowed with fresh fire  hand in hand 
as it were  they climbed into position  and leaped and capered side by
side as if merrily dancing  while little jubilant cracks and clicks and
sounds  as of small hands clapped for joy  accompanied the movement 
then suddenly the splendor faded  and sinking with one consent into
ashes  the cones sifted through the logs and vanished forever  their
mission accomplished  their work done 

with eyes of amazement the lovers gazed upon the spectacle to its close 
as the last spark faded  hilda laid her head again on wilhelm   breast 

 ah   she said  tenderly sighing   the dear old fir  he loved us well 
wilhelm  and that was his  good by   

perhaps it was 




a balsam pillow 


now that fir needles and hemlock needles have become recognized articles
of commerce  and every other shop boasts its row of fragrant cushions 
with their inevitable motto   give me of thy balm  o fir tree   i am
reminded of the first pillow of the sort that i ever saw  and of what it
meant to the girl who made it  i should like to tell you the little
story  simple as it is  it belongs to the time  eight or nine years
since  before pine pillows became popular  perhaps chateaubriand dorset
may be said  for once in her life  to have set a fashion 

yes  that was really her name  her mother met with it in a newspaper 
and  without the least idea as to whether it appertained to man or
woman  adopted it for her baby  the many syllables fascinated her  i
suppose  and there was  besides  that odd joy in a piece of extravagance
that costs nothing  which appeals to the thrifty new england nature 
and is one of its wholesome outlets and indulgences 

so the methodist elder baptized the child  chateaubriand aramintha  
making very queer work of the unfamiliar accents  and then  so far as
practical purposes are concerned  the name ceased to be  how can a busy
household  with milk to set  and milk to skim  and pans to scald  and
butter to make  and pigs to feed  find time for a name like that 
 baby   the little girl was called till she was well settled on her feet
and in the use of her little tongue  then she became  brie   and brie
dorset she remained to the end  few people recollected that she
possessed any other name  unless the marriage  birth  and death pages of
the family bible happened to be under discussion 

the dorsets  was one of those picturesque  lonely  outlying farms  past
which people drive in the summer  saying   how retired  how peaceful  
but past which almost no one drives in the winter  it stood  with its
environment of red barns and apple orchards  at the foot of a low
granite cliff whose top was crowned with a fir wood  and two enormous
elm trees met over its roof and made a checker work of light and shade
on its closely blinded front  no sign of life appeared to the city
people who drew their horses in to admire the situation  except 
perhaps  a hen scratching in the vegetable beds  or a lazy cat basking
on the doorstep  and they would drive on  unconscious that behind the
slats of the green blinds above a pair of eyes watched them go  and a
hungry young heart contrasted their lot with its own 

hungry  there never was anything like the starvation which goes on
sometimes in those shut up farmhouses  boys and girls feel it alike  but
the boys are less to be pitied  for they can usually devise means to get
away 

how could brie get away  she was the only child  her parents had not
married young  when she was nineteen  they seemed almost elderly people 
so badly does life on a bleak new england farm deal with human beings 
her mother  a frail little woman  grew year by year less fit for hard
labor  the farm was not productive  poverty  pinch  the inevitable
recurrence of the same things to be done day after day  month after
month  the same needs followed by the same fatigues   all these brie had
to bear  and all the while the child had that love and longing for the
beautiful which is part of the artist   equipment  and the deprivation
of which is keen suffering  sweet sights  sounds  smells   all these she
craved  and could get only in such measure as her daily work enabled her
to get them from that world of nature which is the satisfaction of eager
hearts to whom all other pleasures are denied 

the fir wood on the upper hill was the temple where she worshipped 
there she went with her bible on sunday afternoons  with her patching
and stocking mending on other days  there she dreamed her dreams and
prayed her prayers  and while there she was content  but all too soon
would come the sound of the horn blown from below  or a call from the
house   brie  brie  the men are coming to supper  make haste   and she
would be forced to hurry back to the workaday world 

harder times followed  when she was just twenty  her father fell from
his loaded hay wagon  and fractured his thigh  there was no cure for the
hurt  and after six months of hopeless tendance  he died  brie and her
mother were left together on the lonely farm  with the added burden of a
large bill for doctoring and medicines  which pressed like a heavy
weight on their honorable hearts 

the hired man  reuben hall  was well disposed and honest  but before mr 
dorset   death he had begun to talk of going to the west  and brie
foreboded that he might not be willing to stay with them  mrs  dorset 
broken down by nursing and sorrow  had become an invalid  unable to
assist save in the lightest ways  the burden was sore for one pair of
young shoulders to bear  brie kept up a brave face by day  but at night 
horrors of helplessness and apprehension seized her  the heavens seemed
as brass  against which her feeble prayers beat in vain  the future was
barred  as it were  with an impassable gate 

what could they do  sell the farm  that would take time  for no one in
particular wanted to buy it  if reuben would stand by them  they might
be able to fight it out for another year  and  what with butter and eggs
and the corn crop  make enough for his wages and a bare living  but
would reuben stay 

our virtues sometimes treat us as investments do  and return a dividend
when we least expect it  it was at this hard crisis that certain good
deeds of brie   in the past stood her friend  she had always been good
to reuben  and her sweet ways and consideration for his comfort had
gradually won a passage into his rather stolid affections  now  seeing
the emergency she was in  and the courage with which she met it  he
could not quite find the heart to  leave the little gal to make out by
herself   fully purposing to go  he stayed  putting off the idea of
departure from month to month  and though  true to his idea of proper
caution  he kept his good intentions to himself  so that the relief of
having him there was constantly tempered by the dread lest he might go
at any time  still it  was  relief 

so april passed  and may and june  the crops were planted  the
vegetables in  brie strained every nerve  she petted her hens  and
coaxed every possible egg out of them  she studied the tastes of the two
cows  she maintained a brave show of cheer for her ailing mother  but
all the time she was sick at heart  everything seemed closing in  how
long could she keep it up 

the balsam firs of the hill grove could have told tales in those days 
they were brie   sole confidants  the consolation they gave  the counsel
they communicated  were mute  indeed  but none the less real to the
anxious girl who sat beneath them  or laid her cheek on their rough
stems  june passed  and with early july came the answer to brie   many
prayers  it came  as answers to prayer often do  in a shape of which she
had never dreamed 

miss mary morgan  teacher in grammar school no  3  ward nineteen  of the
good city of boston  came  tired out from her winter   work  to spend a
few days with farmer allen   wife  her second cousin  stopped one day at
the dorset   door  while driving  to ask for a drink of water  took a
fancy to the old house and to brie  and next day came over to propose
herself as a boarder for three months 

 i can only afford to pay seven dollars a week   she said   but  on the
other hand  i will try not to make much trouble  if you will take me  

 seven dollars a week  only think   cried brie  gleefully  to her mother
after the bargain was completed  and miss morgan gone   doesn   it seem
like a fortune  it ll pay reuben   wages  and leave ever so much over 
and she doesn   eat much meat  she says  and she likes baked potatoes
and cream and sweet baked apples better than anything  and there   the
keeping room chamber all cleaned and ready  doesn   it seem as if she
was sent to us  mother  

 your poor father never felt like keepin  boarders   said mrs  dorset 
 i used to kind of fancy the idea of it  but he wasn   willin   i
thought it would be company to have one in the house  if they was nice
folks  it does seem as if this was the lord   will for us  her coming in
so unexpected  and all  

two days later miss morgan  with a hammock and a folding canvas chair
and a trunk full of light reading  arrived  and took possession of her
new quarters  for the first week or two she did little but rest 
sleeping for hours at a time in the hammock swung beneath the shadowing
elms  then  as the color came back to her thin face and the light to her
eyes  she began to walk a little  to sit with brie in the fir grove  or
read aloud to her on the doorstep while she mended  shelled peas  or
picked over berries  and all life seemed to grow easier and pleasanter
for the dwellers in the solitary farmhouse  the guest gave little
trouble  she paid her weekly due punctually  and the steady income 
small as it was  made all the difference in the world to brie 

as the summer went by  and she grew at home with her new friend  she
found much relief in confiding to her the perplexities of her position 

 i see   miss morgan said   it is the winter that is the puzzle  i will
engage to come back next summer as i have this  and that will help
along  but the time between now and then is the difficulty  

 yes   replied brie   the winter is the puzzle  and reuben   money  we
have plenty of potatoes and corn and vegetables to take us through  and
there   the pig to kill  and the chickens will lay some  if only there
were any way in which i could make enough for reuben   wages  we could
manage  

 i must think it over   said miss morgan 

she pulled a long branch of the balsam fir nearer as she spoke  and
buried her nose in it  it was the first week of september  and she and
brie were sitting in the hill grove 

 i love this smell so   she said   it is delicious  it makes me dream  

brie broke off a bough 

 i shall hang it over your bed   she said   and you will smell it all
night  

so the fir bough hung upon the wall till it gradually yellowed  and the
needles began to drop 

 why  they are as sweet as ever   sweeter   declared brie  smelling a
handful which she had swept from the floor  then an idea came into her
head 

she gathered a great fagot of the branches  and laid them to dry in the
sun on the floor of a little used piazza  when partly dried  she
stripped off the needles  stuffed with them a square cotton bag  and
made for that a cover of soft sage green silk  with an odd shot pattern
over it  it was a piece of what had been her great grandmother   wedding
gown 

 voilà   do you realize the situation  reader  brie had made the first
of all the many balsam pillows  it was meant for a good by gift to miss
morgan 

 your cushion is the joy of my life   wrote that lady to her a month
after she went home   every one who sees it  falls in love with it  half
a dozen people have asked me how they could get one like it  and  brie 
this has given me an idea  why should you not make them for sale  i will
send you up some pretty silk for the covers  and you might cross stitch
a little motto if you liked  i copy some for you  two people have given
me an order already  they will pay four dollars apiece if you like to
try  

this suggestion was the small wedge of the new industry  brie lost no
time in making the two pillows  grandmother   gown fortunately holding
out for their covers  then came some pretty red silk from miss morgan 
with yellow  filoselle  for the mottoes  and more orders  brie worked
busily that winter  for her balsam pillows had to be made in spare
moments when other work permitted  the grove on the hill was her
unfailing treasury of supply  the thick set twigs bent them to her will 
the upper branches seemed to her to rustle as with satisfaction at the
aid they were giving  in the spring the old trees renewed their foliage
with vigorous purpose  as if resolved not to balk her in her purpose 

the fir grove paid reuben   wages that winter  miss morgan came back the
following june  and by that time balsam pillows were established as
articles of commerce  and brie had a munificent offer from a recently
established decorative art society for a supply of the needles  at
three dollars the pound  it was hard  dirty work to prepare such a
quantity  but she did not mind that 

as i said  this was some years since  brie no longer lives in her old
home  her mother died the third year after miss morgan came to them  the
farm is sold  and brie married  she lives now on a ranch in colorado 
but she has never forgotten the fir grove  and the memory of it is a
help often in the desponding moments that come at times to all lives 

 i could not be worse off than i was then   she says to herself   there
seemed no help or hope anywhere  i felt as if god didn   care and didn  
hear my prayers  and yet  all the time  there was dear miss morgan
coming to help us  and there were the trees  great beautiful things 
nodding their heads  and trying to show me what could be made out of
them  no  i never will be faithless again  nor let myself doubt  however
dark things may look  but remember my balsam pillows  and trust in
god  




colonel wheeler 


colonel wheeler  as any one might see at a glance  had been a gallant
officer in his day  it was true that he no longer had anything to do
with military movements  but his very face suggested a martial past  so
did his figure  which  though thin to an almost incredible degree  was
unmistakably that of a military man  and also his dress  for the colonel
invariably appeared in full uniform  with a scarlet  gold laced coat 
epaulettes  and a cocked hat and feathers  seldom removed even at
meal times  his moustache waved fiercely half way across his cheeks  his
eyes were piercing  and his eyebrows black and frowning  in short  it
would be difficult to imagine a more warlike appearance than he
presented on the most peaceful occasions 

like all truly brave men  colonel wheeler was as gentle as he was
valiant  and nothing pleased him better in the piping times of peace
than to be detailed on escort duty  and made of use to the ladies of his
acquaintance  so it came to pass that again and again he was asked to
take charge of large family parties on long journeys  you might see him
starting off with a wife or two  half a dozen sisters in law  and from
eight to fourteen children  all of them belonging to somebody else  not
one of them being kith or kin to the gallant colonel  they made really a
formidable assemblage when collected  and it took the longest legal
envelope which liz  

there  i have let out the secret  colonel wheeler was a paper doll  and
these ladies and children who travelled about with him were paper dolls
also  they belonged to lizzie bruce and her cousin ernestine  who
between them owned several whole families of such  these families were
all large  none of the mamma dolls had less than twelve children  and
some of them had as many as twenty  lizzie and ernestine despised people
not made of paper  who had only two or three little boys and girls  in
fact  lizzie was once heard to say of some neighbors with eleven
children   they are the only really satisfactory people i ever
knew   just as good as paper dolls   and this was meant as the highest
possible compliment 

lizzie lived in annapolis  md   and ernestine in hingham  mass   so  as
you will see  there was a long distance between their homes  it took a
day and a half to make the journey  and the little cousins did not visit
each other more than once or twice a year  but the dolls went much
oftener   they  travelled by mail  in one of those long yellow envelopes
which lawyers use to put papers in  and colonel wheeler always went in
the same envelope to take care of them  when they came back from these
trips  lizzie or ernestine  whichever it chanced to be  would unpack
them  and exclaim delightedly   how well the dear things look  so much
better for the change  see  mamma  how round and pink their faces have
grown  

 i wouldn   advise you to depend so much on colonel wheeler   lizzie  
mother would sometimes say   these military men are rather uncertain
characters  i wouldn   send off all the dolls at once with him  if i
were you  and really  lizzie  such constant journeys are very expensive 
there is never a stamp in my desk when i want one in a hurry  

 but  mamma  the children really  had  to have a change   lizzie would
protest  with tears in her eyes   and as for the colonel  he is such a
good man  truly  mamma  he would never steal anybody else   family  he
takes beau tiful care of the dolls  always  

 very well  we shall see   answered mamma  with a teazing smile  but she
saw that lizzie was in earnest  so she did not say anything more to
trouble her  and the very next day contributed seven postage stamps to
pay for the transportation of a large party which lizzie wanted to send
on to hingham for a christmas visit 

this party included  besides colonel wheeler  who as usual acted as
escort  mrs  allen  the wife of captain allen  her fourteen children 
her sister in law miss allen  her own sister pauline gray   so called
because her only dress happened to be made of gray and blue
tissue paper   and mrs  adipose and her little girl  mrs  adipose  whose
name had been suggested by papa  was the fattest of all the dolls  her
daughter was fat  too  and ernestine had increased this effect by making
her a jacket so much too large for her that it could only be kept on
with a dab of glue  captain allen was a creature who had no real
existence  lizzie meant to make a doll to represent him some day 
meanwhile  he was kept persistently  at the front   wherever that might
be  and mrs  allen travelled about as freely as if she had no husband at
all  this lizzie and ernestine considered an admirable arrangement  for 
as captain allen never came home and never wrote  he was as little of an
inconvenience to his family as any gentleman can ever hope to be 

well  this large and mixed company started off gayly in the mail bag 
and in due time lizzie heard of their safe arrival  that they were all
well  and that the baby  already looked better for the change   about
three weeks later another letter came  and she opened it without the
least qualm of anxiety  or any suspicion of the dreadful news it was to
bring  it ran thus   

    dear liz   mrs  adipose grew a little home sick  she began to
    worry about mr  adipose  she was afraid he would have trouble
    with the servants  or else try to clean house while she was
    away  and make an awful mess all over everything  you never
    could tell what men would do when they were left alone  she
    said  so  as i saw she wasn   enjoying herself any more  and as
    the baby and little ellen seemed to have got as much good out of
    the visit as they were likely to get  i sent them back last week
    friday  and hope you got them safely 

lizzie dropped the letter with a scream of dismay  this was saturday 
last week friday was more than a week ago  where  oh  where were the
precious dolls 

she flew with her tragic tale to mamma  who  for all she was very sorry 
could not help laughing 

 you know i warned you against trusting too much to colonel wheeler  
she said 

 oh  mamma  it isn   his fault  i am sure it isn     pleaded lizzie   i
have perfect confidence in him  think how often he has gone to hingham 
and never once didn   come back  he  would  have fetched them safely if
he hadn   been interfered with  i know he would  no  something dreadful
has happened   it   that horrid post office   and she wrung her hands 

mamma was very sorry for lizzie  papa wrote to the postmaster  and
ernestine   papa inquired at the hingham post office  and there was
quite a stir over the lost travellers 

time went on  a month  six weeks  two months passed  and no tidings
came  and mr  adipose still sat in the lonely baby house  watching the
cook brandishing a paper saucepan  always the same saucepan  over the
toy stove  and bridget  the  housemaid   forever dusting the same
table top  and never getting any farther on with her work  mamma
proposed that lizzie should make some new dolls to take the place of the
lost ones  and offered help and the use of her mucilage bottle  but
lizzie shook her head sorrowfully 

 i can   help feeling as if the allens may come back some day   she
said   colonel wheeler is such a good traveller  and what would they
think if there was a strange family in their rooms  besides  it   almost
as much fun to play without them  because there is mr  adipose  a
widower  you know  which is very interesting  and the two pairs of
twins  which mrs  allen forgot to take  besides  i can always make
believe that they are coming to morrow  

the very next morning after this conversation  as mamma sat writing in
her room upstairs  she heard a wild shriek at the front door  the
postman had rapped a moment before  and lizzie had rushed down to meet
him  as she had each day since the dolls were lost  the shriek was so
loud and sudden that mrs  bruce jumped up  but before she could get to
the door in flew lizzie  holding in her hand a wild huddle of battered
blue envelopes with  dead letter office  stamped on their corners  and a
mass of pink and gray and green gowns and funny tumbled capes and hats 
it was the doll party  returned at last 

 mamma  mamma   she cried   what did i tell you  colonel wheeler didn  
run away with them  he has brought them all home  

there they were indeed  mrs  adipose as fat as ever  mrs  allen  and all
her children  the sister  the sister in law  and colonel wheeler  erect
and dignified as usual  in spite of a green crease across both his legs 
and a morsel of postage stamp in his eye  and wearing an air of
conscious merit  which the occasion fully warranted  as lizzie
rapturously embraced him  she cried   dear old colonel  nobody believed
in you but me  not even mamma  i knew you hadn   run away with nineteen
people  mamma laughed at me  but she doesn   know you as well as i do 
nobody shall ever laugh at you again  

and nobody did  colonel wheeler had earned public confidence  and from
that day to this no one has dared to say a word against him in lizzie  
hearing  he has made several journeys to hingham without the least
misadventure  and papa says he would trust him to escort lizzie herself
if it were necessary  he is the hero of the dolls  home  and poor old
mr  adipose  who never stirs from home  is made miserable by having him
held up as a perpetual model for imitation  but unlike the generality of
heroes  colonel wheeler lives up to his reputation  and is not less
modest  useful  and agreeable in the domestic circle because of being so
exceptionally meritorious 




ninety three and ninety four 


ninety three and ninety four were two houses standing side by side in
the outskirts of a country town  and to all outward appearance as like
each other as two peas  they were the pioneer buildings of a small brick
block  but as yet the rest of the block had not been built  which was
all the better for ninety three and ninety four  and gave them more
space and outlook  both had french roofs with dormer windows  both front
doors  grained  to represent oak  the graining falling into a pattern of
regular stripes like a watered silk  and across the front of each  on
the ground floor  ran the same little sham balcony of varnished
iron   balconies on which nothing heavier than a cat could venture
without risk of bringing the frail structures down into the street 

inside  the houses differed in trifling respects  as houses must which
are under the control of differing minds  but in one point they were
precisely alike within   which was  that the back room of the third
story of each was occupied by a girl of seventeen 

it is of these two rooms that i want to tell the story  so much has been
said and written of late years about home decoration and the methods of
producing it  that i think some other girls of seventeen with rooms to
make pretty may like to hear of how eleanor pyne and may blodgett
managed theirs 

eleanor was the girl at ninety three  she and may were intimate friends 
or considered themselves such  intimacy is a word very freely used among
young people who have not learned what a sacred word it is and how very
much it means  they had grown up together  had gone to the same schools 
shared most of their pleasures as well as their lessons  sent each other
christmas presents and birthday cards every year  and consulted in
advance over their clothes  spring bonnets  and fancy work  which  taken
all together  may be said to make an intimacy according to the general
use of the term  so it was natural that  when may  stirred by the sense
of young ladyhood just at hand and by the modern impulse for house
decoration  desired to  do over  and beautify her room  eleanor should
desire it also 

making a room pretty nowadays would seem easy enough where there is
plenty of money for the purpose  there is only the embarrassment of
choice  though that is so embarrassing at times as to lead one to envy
those grandmothers of ours  who  with only three or four patterns of
everything to choose from  and those all ugly  had but the simple task
of selecting the least ugly  but in the case of my two girls there was
this further complication  that very little money could be used for
adornment of the bedrooms  mrs  blodgett and mrs  pyne had consulted
over the matter  and the decision was that eleanor and may might each
spend twenty dollars  and no more 

what can be done with twenty dollars  it will buy one pretty article of
furniture  it will pay for a  kensington art square   with perhaps
enough left for cheese cloth curtains  it will paper a room  or paint
it  you can easily dispose of the whole of it  if you will  in a single
portière  and here were two rooms which needed renovation from floor to
ceiling 

the rooms were of the same size  both had two windows looking north and
an ample closet  the most important difference lay in the fact that the
builder of the houses  for some reason known only to himself  had put a
small fireplace across the corner of eleanor   room  and had put none in
may     per contra  may   room was papered  which she considered a
counterbalancing advantage  but as the paper was not very pretty 
eleanor did not agree with her 

many were the consultations held between the two girls  and just here 
before they had actually begun operations  a piece of good luck befell
both of them  eleanor   grandmother presented her with an easy chair  an
old one  very shabby as to cover  but a good chair still  and very
comfortable  and almost simultaneously a happily timed accident occurred
to mrs  blodgett   spare room carpet  which made the buying of a new one
necessary  and the old one was given to may  it was a still respectable
brussels  with rather a large medallion figure on a green ground  it did
not comport very well with the blue and drab paper on the walls  and the
medallions looked very big on the smaller floor  but may cared nothing
for that  and she accepted her windfall gleefully 

 it will save ever and ever so much   she said  joyously   carpets do
cost so  poor eleanor  you will have to get one for yourself  unless you
can persuade your cook to upset an oil lamp on one of your mother    

 oh  annie is too careful  she could never be persuaded to do such a
thing as that   laughed eleanor   besides  i don   want her to  i don  
like any of mother   carpets very much  

 well  i don   care what sort of a carpet it is so long as i don   have
to buy it   said may 

 i do   replied eleanor 

she did  there was this great point of difference between the friends 
eleanor possessed by nature that eye for color and sense of effects
which belongs to what people call the  artistic  temperament  may had
none of this  and did not even understand what it meant  to her all reds
and olives and yellows were alike  differences of tone  inflections of
tint  were lost on her untrained and unappreciative vision  she was
unconscious of this deficiency  so it did not annoy her  and as eleanor
had a quiet and pleasant way of differing with her  they never
quarrelled  but none the less did each hold to her own point of view and
her own opinion 

so  while may read eagerly all the articles in the secular and religious
papers which show how girls and women have made plain homes cheaply
charming by painting sunflowers and black eyed susans on ink bottles and
molasses jugs  converting pork barrels into arm chairs with the aid of
 excelsior  and burlaps  and  lighting up  dark corners with six cent
fans  and was fired with an ambition to do the same  eleanor silently
dissented from her enthusiasms  she was ready to help  however  even
when she did not agree  and may  glad of the help  did not notice much
the lack of sympathy  it is often so in friendships  one does the
talking and one the listening  one kisses while the other holds out the
cheek  as the french proverb puts it  one lays down the law and the
other differs without disputing it  so both are satisfied 

it was so in this case  eleanor was doing a great deal of quiet thinking
and planning while may chattered by the hour over her projects 

 what i want my room to be   she told her friend   is gay and dressy  i
hate dull looking rooms  and having no carpet or paper to buy i can get
lots of chintz  there   a lovely pattern on the bargain counter at
shell   for fourteen cents  all over roses  i am going to have a whole
piece of it  and just cover up all that awful old yellow furniture of
mine entirely  the bureau is to have little rods across the front and
curtains to hide the drawers  like that picture in the  pomologist   and
i shall make a soapbox footstool and a barrel chair  and have
lambrequins and a drapery over my bed  and a coverlet and valances  the
washstand i have decided to do in burlaps with cat tails embroidered on
the front  and a splasher with a pattern of swans and   wash and be
clean   won   it be lovely 

 you know those black walnut book shelves of mine   she went on  after a
pause   well  i am going to cover them in white muslin with little
pleated ruffles on the edges and pink satin bows at the corners  sarah
stanton has promised to paint me a stone bottle with roses to put on
top  and bell short is working me a wall banner  it   going to be the
gayest little place you ever saw  

 won   the white muslin soil soon  and won   so much chintz get very
dusty   objected eleanor 

 oh  they can be washed   replied may  easily 

so the big roll of chintz was ordered home  and for a fortnight she and
eleanor spent all their spare time in hemming ruffles  tacking pleatings
on to wooden shelves  and putting up frills and curtains  when all was
done the room looked truly very fresh and gay  the old yellow  cottage
furniture  had vanished under its raiment of chintz and was quite
hidden  even the foot board of the bed had its slip cover and flounce 
the books were ranged in rows on the muslin shelves with crisp little
ruffles above and below  flowers and bright colored zig zags of crewels
adorned everything  wherever it was possible  a japanese fan was stuck
on the wall  or a bow of ribbon  or a little embroidered something  or a
christmas card  scarfs of one sort or another were looped across the
corners of the pictures  tidies innumerable adorned the chair backs and
table tops  there was a general look of fulness and of an irresistible
tendency in things to be of no particular use except to make spots of
meaningless color and keep the eye roving restlessly to and fro 

 isn   it just lovely   said may  as she stood in the doorway to take in
the effect   now  eleanor pyne  do say it   lovely  

 it   as bright as can be   answered eleanor  cordially   only i can  
bear to think of all these pretty things getting dusty  they re so nice
and fresh now  

 oh  they can easily be dusted   said may   you are a perfect crank
about dust  elly  now  here is my account  i think i have managed pretty
well  don   you  

the account ran thus   

    sixty yards of chintz at 14 cents a yard      8 40
    burlaps  cheese cloth  white muslin           3 25
    fans  ribbons  crewels                        1 60
    stamping a tidy                                 30
    one wicker work chair                         5 00
    hanging basket                                1 25
                                                      
    total                                        19 80

 there   twenty cents left over   explained may  as she finished reading
the items   that will just get a yellow ribbon to tie round the handle
of my clothes brush  eleanor  you ve been ever so good to help me so
much  when are you going to begin your room  you must let me help you
now  

 i began this morning  

 have you really begun  what did you get  

 oh  i didn   get anything  this first thing isn   to cost anything at
all  

 why  what is it  

 you know that ugly fire board in front of my fireplace  i have taken it
upstairs to the attic  and mother has lent me some cunning little
andirons and a shovel and tongs which grandmamma gave her  and i am
going to have an open fire  

 but you don   need one  the room is warm enough  with your register  

 oh  i know that  and i didn   mean that i was going to  light  the
fire  only have it all ready for lighting  i rubbed the brass knobs
myself with puit   pomade  and they shine  beautifully   and i painted
the bricks with red ochre and water  and arranged the wood and
kindlings  and it has such a cosy  homelike look  you can   think  

 well  i confess i don   see the cosiness of a fire that you re never
going to light  

 oh  mamma says if i ever am sick in bed  or there is any particular
reason for it  i may light it  and even if it doesn   happen often  i
shall have the comfort of knowing that it   all ready  

 i call it cold comfort  what a queer girl you are  well  what are you
going to do next  elly  

 you will laugh when i tell you  i   going to paper my room myself  

 not really  why  you can    papering is very difficult  i have always
heard so  people have to get men to do it  always  

 i don   believe it   so very difficult  there was a piece about it once
in the  family friend  which i cut out and saved  it told how to make
the paste and everything  and it didn   seem hard at all  mother thinks
i can  i   going to begin to morrow  in fact  i began yesterday  for old
joyce came and mended the crack in the ceiling and kalsomined it  and
oh  may  i did such a  thrifty  thing  he had a nice big brush and a
roller to smooth out the paper with  and don   you think  i made a
bargain with him to hire them out to me for three cents an hour  so i
sha     have to buy any  

 didn   he laugh  

 yes  he laughed  and ned laughed too  but i don   care   let those
laugh who win    concluded eleanor  with a bright  confident smile 

 come in to morrow afternoon and see how i get on   she called out from
the door of ninety three 

may went at the appointed time  the papering was done  and for a
beginner very well done  though an expert might easily have found faulty
places here and there  the paper eleanor had chosen was of a soft  warm
yellow like pale sunshine  which seemed to neutralize the cold light of
the north windows  it looked plain when seen in shadow  but where the
light struck it revealed a pattern of graceful interlaced disks  and the
ceiling was tinted with a much lighter shade of the same yellow  a
chestnut picture rod separated wall and ceiling 

 putting the paper on myself saved  lots    announced eleanor 
gleefully   it only cost fifteen cents a roll  so the whole room came to
exactly a dollar eighty  then i am to pay joyce eighteen cents for six
hours  use of his brush and roller  and mother isn   going to charge
anything for the flour for the paste  because i boiled it myself  i had
to get the picture moulding  though  and that was rather dear   nearly
two dollars  ned nailed it up for me  

 why didn   you have a paper border  it would not have cost nearly as
much  

 no  but i should have had to drive nails and tacks in every time i
wanted to hang up anything  and that would have spoiled the paper  and i
want that to last a long  long time  

 what are you going to do with your furniture   asked may  casting an
eye of disfavor at the articles in question  a so called  cottage  set 
enamelled  of a faded  shabby blue 

 i am going to paint them   replied eleanor  daringly 

 eleanor pyne  you can    

but eleanor could and did  painting is by no means the recondite art
which some of its professors would have us suppose  eleanor avoided one
of the main difficulties of the craft  by buying her paint ready mixed
and qualified with  dryers   she chose a pretty tint of olive brown  ned
took her bedstead apart for her  and one by one she carried the
different articles to a little used attic  where  equipped in a
long sleeved apron and a pair of old cotton gloves to save her fingers 
she gradually coated each smoothly with the new paint  it took some
days to finish  for she did not work continuously  but when done she
felt rewarded for her pains  for the furniture not only looked new  but
was prettier than it had ever been before during the memory of man  her
brother ned was so pleased with her success  that he volunteered  if she
would pay for the  stuff   to make a broad pine shelf to nail over the
narrow shelf of her chimney piece  and some smaller ones above  cut
after a pretty design which he had seen in an agricultural magazine 
this handsome offer eleanor gladly accepted  and when the shelves were
done  she covered them with two coats of the same useful olive brown
paint 

there was still some paint left  and grown bold with practice and no
longer afraid of her big brush  eleanor essayed a bolder flight  she
first painted her doors and her window frames  then she attacked her
floor  and  leaving an ample square space in the middle  executed a
border two feet and a half wide all round it  in a pattern of long
diamonds done in two shades of olive  the darker being obtained by
mixing a little black with the original tint 

 you see i have to buy my own carpet   she explained to the astonished
and somewhat scandalized may   and with this border a little square one
will answer  instead of my having to get a great big thing for the whole
floor  

 but sha     you hate to put your feet on bare boards  

 that   just what i sha     do  don   you see that the bureau and
washstand and the bedstead and towel frame and all the rest fill up
nearly all the space i have left for a border  what   the use of buying
carpet for  them  to stand on  

may shook her head  she was not capable of such original reasoning  in
her code the thing that generally had been always should be 

 well  it seems rather queer to me  and not very comfortable   she said 
 and i can   think why you painted those shelves over the mantel instead
of covering them with something   chintz  now  they would have looked
awfully pretty with pinked ruffles  you know  and long curtains to draw
across the front like that picture you saw in  home made happy   

 oh  i shouldn   have liked that at all  i should hate the idea of
calico curtains to a mantel piece  it would always seem as if they were
going to catch fire  

 but they  couldn     you don   have any fire   persisted may 

 no  but they would seem so  and i want my fire to look as if it could
be lighted at any minute  

eleanor   instinct was based on an  underlying principle   it is a
charming point in any fireplace to look as if it were constantly ready
for use  inflammable draperies  however pretty  militate against this
look  and so are a mistake in taste  especially in our changeful new
england climate  where  even in midsummer  a little blaze may at any
moment be desirable to cheer a dull day or warm a chilly evening 

but may herself was forced to admit that the room looked  comfortable 
when the square of pretty ingrain carpeting of a warm golden brown was
tacked into its place  and the furniture brought back from the attic and
arranged  things at once fell into harmonious relation with each other 
as in a well thought out room they should do  the creamy  bright paper
made a pleasant background  there was an air of cheerfulness even on
cloudy days  may could not understand the reason of this  or why on such
days her reds and pinks and drabs and greens and blues never seemed to
warm her out of dulness 

 i am sure my colors are a great deal brighter than yours   she would
say   i cannot imagine why they don   light up better  

eleanor did not try for many evanescent prettinesses  in fact  she could
not  even had she wished to do so  for her money was all spent  so  as
she told her mother  she contented herself with having secured things
that would wear  and a pretty color  she put short curtains of  scrim 
at her windows  and plain serviceable towels which could be often washed
on her bureau and table tops  the bureau was enlivened by a large 
square scarlet pincushion  the only bit of finery in which eleanor
indulged  amid the subdued tone of its surroundings it looked absolutely
brilliant  like the famous red wafer which the great turner stuck in the
foreground of his dim tinted landscape  and which immediately seemed to
take the color out of the bright pictures on either side 

later  when eleanor had learned to do the pretty mexican work  now in
fashion  she decorated some special towels for her table and bureau 
with lace like ends  and a pair of pillow covers  meanwhile  she bore
very well the knowledge that may and most of the other girls of their
set considered her room rather  plain and bare   it suited her own
fancy  and that satisfied her 

 i do like room to turn about in and not too many things  and not to
smell of dust   she told her mother 

here is eleanor   budget of expenses  to set against may     

    wall paper  twelve rolls                                       1 80
    use of brush and roller                                          18
    kalsomining ceiling                                            1 75
    picture moulding                                               2 00
    two gallons of mixed paint  at  1 80 per gallon                3 60
    brush                                                            30
    nine yards of ingrain carpeting at sixty five cents a yard     5 85
    carpet thread and tacks                                          20
    pine shelving                                                  1 00
    chintz for chair cover put on by eleanor herself               1 75
    satin and ribbon for cushion                                   1 12
                                                                       
    total                                                         19 86

this was two years ago  if you could take a peep at the rival rooms in
ninety three and ninety four to day  you would find eleanor   looking
quite as pretty as when new  or prettier  for she has used it
carefully  and each year has added something to its equipments  as years
will  when a girl has once secured a good foundation for her room  her
friends are apt to make their gifts work in toward its further
beautification 

with may it is different  her room has lost the freshness which was its
one good point  the chintz has become creased and a little faded  the
muslin and scrim from repeated washings are no longer crisp  and look
limp and threadbare  all the ribbons and scarfs are shabby and tumbled 
while the green carpet and the blue wall  swear  as vigorously at each
other as they did at first  may sighs over it frequently  and wishes she
had tried for a more permanent effect  next time she will do better  she
avers  but next times are slow in coming where the family exchequer has
not the recuperative powers of fortunatus   purse 

the moral of this simple tale may be divided into three heads  i object
to morals myself as a wind up for stories  and i dare say most of you
who read this are no fonder of them than i am  still  a three headed
moral is such a novelty that it may be urged as an excuse  the three
heads are these   

1  when you have only a small sum to spend on renovations  choose those
that will last 

2  ingenuity and energy count for more than mere money can 

3  once make sure in a room of convenience  cheerfulness  and a good
color  and you can afford to wait for gimcracks  or  jamescracks   or
any of the thousand and one little duds which so many people consider
indispensable features of pleasantness  rooms have their anatomy as well
as human beings  there must be a good substructure of bones rightly
placed to underlie the bloom and sparkle in the one  and in like manner
for the other the laws of taste  which are immutable  should underlie
and support the evanescent and passing fancies and fashions of every
day 




the sorrows of felicia 


it was a pretty chamber  full of evidences of taste and loving care 
white curtains draped the windows and the looking glass  there was a
nice writing table  set where the light fell upon it exactly as it
should for convenience to the writer  there was a book shelf full of
gayly bound books  a pretty blue carpet  photographs on the faintly
tinted blue wall   somebody had evidently taken pains to make the room
charming  and just as evidently to make it charming for the use of a
girl  and there lay the girl on the sofa   felicia  or  in schoolroom
parlance  felie bliss  was she basking in the comfort and tastefulness
of her room  not at all  a volume of  in memoriam  was in her hand  her
face was profoundly long and dismal  she murmured mournful lines over to
herself  only pausing now and then to reach out her hand and fill a
tumbler from a big jug of lemonade which stood on a little table beside
her  felie always provided herself with lemonade when she retired to her
bedroom to enjoy the pleasures of woe for a season 

from the door  which was locked  sounded a chorus of knocks and
irreverent voices 

 sister  are you in there   demanded one 

 are you thinking about life  sister   asked another 

 have you got your sharp pointed scissors with you   cried the first
voice   oh  felie  felie  stay your rash hand  

 we like lemonade just as much as you   chimed in dimple  the youngest
of the four 

 let us in  we are very thirsty  and we long to comfort you   said voice
the second  with a stifled giggle 

felicia paid no attention whatever to these observations  only murmured
to herself   

     but what to her shall be the end 
       and what to me remains of good 
       to her perpetual maidenhood   

 who is  her    demanded that bad jenny through the door   if you mean
mrs  carrington  you are all wrong  may curtis says her engagement is
announced to mr  collins  

 oh  children  do go away   cried felie in a despairing tone 

     forgive these wild and wandering cries 
       confessions of a wasted youth 
       forgive them where they fail in truth 
     and in thy wisdom make me wise  

 hear her   said betty outside   she   having it very badly to day  i
wish i knew tennyson  i should like to tell him what i think of his
writing a horrid  melancholy  caterwauling book  and making the bliss
family miserable  felie  if you ve drunk up all your lemonade  you might
at least lend us the pitcher  

it was no use  felicia either did not  or would not  hear  so  with a
last thump on the panels of the long suffering door  the trio departed
in search of another pitcher 

if anybody had told felie bliss  at seventeen  that she really had not
a grief in the world worthy of the name  she would have resented it
deeply  she was a tall girl  whose bones and frame were meant for the
use of a large woman  when their owner should have arrived at all that
nature meant her to be  but who at this period of her life was almost
startlingly long and thin  she had  outgrown her strength   as people
say  which was felie   only excuse for the almost tragic enjoyment
which she took in mournful things  she was in fair health  and had
an excellent appetite  and a real school girl love for raisins 
stick cinnamon  sugar plums  and soda water  tastes which were
highly at variance with the rôle which she wished to play   that of a
sweetly resigned and long suffering being  whose hopes had faded from
earth  into the distant heaven toward which she was hastening  felie  
sweet tooth was quite a trial to her  but she struggled with it  and
resisted enjoyment as far as was possible with her naturally cheerful
disposition 

she was an interesting perplexity to her family  who were contented 
reasonable folk  of the sort which  happily for the world  is called
commonplace  to her younger sisters  especially  felicia was a
never failing and exciting conundrum  the answer to which they were
always guessing  but never could find out  for days together she would
be as cheerful as possible  full of fun and contrivance  and the life of
the house  then  all of a sudden  gloom would envelop her like a soft
fog  and she would retire to her room with  in memoriam   or some other
introspective volume  and the fat jug of lemonade  lock the door  and
just  drink and weep for hours together   as her sister jenny expressed
it  it was really unaccountable 

all her books were deeply scored with lines against the woful passages 
and such pencilled remarks as  alas   and  all too true   she sat in
church with a carefully arranged sad smile on her face  but this  as
unsuitable to her natural expression  was not always a success  felie
was much aggrieved one day at being told  by an indiscriminating friend 
that her face  seemed made to laugh   no one could imagine it anything
but bright   this  for a girl who was posing for  patience on a monument
smiling at grief   was rather a trial  but then the friend had never
seen her reading  king john   and murmuring   

     here i and sorrow sit   

with a long brown stick of cinnamon  in process of crunch  occupying the
other corner of her mouth  but perhaps the friend might have found even
this funny   there are such unfeeling people in the world 

felie   letters were rather dull reading  because she told so little of
what she had said or done  and hinted so liberally at her own aching
heart and thwarted hopes  but her correspondents  who were mostly jolly
school girls  knew her pretty well  and dismissed these jeremiads as 
 just felie   way  she does love to be miserable  you know  but nobody
is better fun than she when she doesn   think it her duty to be
unhappy  

felie didn   come down to tea on the evening of the day on which our
story opens  an afternoon of lemonade had dampened her appetite  but at
bedtime she stole out in her dressing gown and slippers  helped herself
to a handful of freshly baked cookies and a large green cucumber pickle 
and  by the aid of these refreshments  contrived to stave off the pangs
of hunger till next morning  when she appeared at breakfast cheerful and
smiling  with no sign upon her spirits of the eclipse of the day before 
her family made no allusion to that melancholy episode   they were used
to such   only mr  bliss asked  between two mouthfuls of toast   where
were you gadding to last night  child  i didn   hear you come home  

 i was not out  i didn   feel very  very bright  and went to bed early  

 oh    mr  bliss understood 

 he who makes truth unlovely commits high treason against virtue   says
an old writer  but he who simulates grief  and makes it ridiculous 
commits an almost equal crime against true feeling  felie had been
playing at sorrow where no sorrow was  that very day a real sorrow came 
and she woke up to find her world all changed into a reality of pain and
puzzle and bewilderment  which was very different from the fictitious
loss and the sham suffering which she had found so much to her mind 

she had no idea  as she watched her father and mother drive off that
afternoon  that anything terrible was about to happen  only the  seers 
of the scotch legends could see the shroud drawn up over the breast of
those who are  appointed to die  suddenly  the rest of us see nothing 
the horse which mr  bliss drove was badly broken  but he had often gone
out before and come back safely  it was only on this particular day that
the combination of circumstances occurred which made the risky horse
dangerous   the shriek of the railroad whistle  the sharp turn in the
road  the heap of stones  there was a runaway  an overset  and two hours
from the time when the youthful sisters  unexpectant of misfortune  had
watched their parents off  they were brought back  mr  bliss dead  mrs 
bliss with a broken arm  and injuries to the spine so severe that there
was little chance of her ever being able to leave her bed again  so much
can be done in one fatal moment 

it is at such dark  dark times that real character shows itself  felie  
little affectations  her morbid musings and fancies  fell from her like
some light  fantastic drapery  which is shrivelled in sudden heat  her
real self  hopeful  self reliant  optimistic  rose into action as soon
as the first paralyzing shock of pain was past  and she had taken in the
reality of this new and strange thing  all the cares of the house  the
management of affairs  the daily wear and tear of life  which has to be
borne by  some one   fell upon her inexperienced hands  her mother was
too shaken and ill to be consulted  the younger girls instinctively
leaned on what they felt to be a strength superior to their own  it was
a heavy load for young shoulders  and felie was not yet eighteen 

she made mistakes of course   mistakes repented of with bitter crying
and urgent resolutions  she was often tried  often discouraged  things
did not smooth themselves easily  or the world go much out of its usual
course  because felie bliss was perplexed and in trouble  there were no
mornings to spare for tragedy  or tennyson  felie   eyeballs often
longed for the relief of a good fit of tears  that troublesome little
lump would come into her throat which is the price of tears resolutely
held back  but there was too much to do to allow of such a weakening
self indulgence  mother must be cared for  the house must be looked
after  people on business must be seen  the  children   as she called
her sisters  must not be suffered to be too sad  and then  again   in
memoriam   beautiful as it is  and full of sweet and true and tender
feeling  did not satisfy felie now as it had done when she was forced to
cultivate an artificial emotion outside of herself 

 if i had time and knew how to write poetry  i could say a great many
things that tennyson never thought of   she told jenny  one day  it is
so with all who suffer  no poet ever voiced the full and complete
expression of our own personal pain  there is always something
beyond   an individual pang recognized and understood only by ourselves 

so the years went on  as years do even when their wheels seem weighted
with lead  the first sharpness of their loss abated  they became used to
the sight of their father   empty chair  of his closed desk  they ceased
to listen for the sound of his step on the porch  his key in the door 
mrs  bliss gradually regained a more comfortable measure of health  but
she remained an invalid  the chief variation in her life being when she
was lifted from bed to sofa  and back again from sofa to bed  felie was
twenty four  and the younger ones were no longer children  though she
still called them so  even dimple wore long dresses  and had set up
something very like a lover  though felie sternly refused to have him
called so till dimple was older  felie was equally severe with dr 
ernest allen  on her own account   she was a great deal too busy to
think of such a thing   she declared  but dr  allen  who had faith in
time  simply declared that he  didn   mind waiting   and continued to
hang his hat on the hat tree in the bliss   entry three times a week 

indeed  looking at felicia bliss  now that she had rounded physically
and mentally into what she was meant to become  you would not wonder
that any man should be willing to wait a while in hope of winning such a
prize  a certain bright cheer and helpfulness was her charm   the room
grew pleasanter as soon as she came into it   dimple declared  certainly
dr  allen thought so  and as a man may willingly put off building a
house till he can afford to have one which fronts the sun  so he
considered it worth while to delay  for a few years  even  if need be 
and secure for life a daily shining which should make all life
pleasanter  he had never known felie in her morbid days  and she could
never make him quite believe her when she tried to tell of that past
phase of her girlhood 

 it is simply impossible  you must exaggerate  if you have not dreamed
it   he said 

 not a bit  ask dimple   ask any of them  

 i prefer to ask my own eyes  my own convictions   declared the lover 
 you are the most  wholesome  woman  through and through  that i ever
knew  a doctor argues from present indications to past conditions  i am
sure you are mistaken about yourself  if i can detect with the
stethoscope the spot in your lungs where five years back pneumonia left
a trace  surely i ought to be able to make out a similar spot in your
nervous temperament  the idea is opposed to all that you are  

 but not to all that i was  really and truly  dr  allen  i used to be
the most absurd girl in the world  if you could have seen me  

 but what cured you in this radical and surprising manner  

 well   said felie  demurely   i suppose the remedy was what you would
call homeopathic  i had revelled in a sort of imaginary sorrowfulness 
but when that dreadful time came  and i tasted real sorrow  i found that
it took all my strength to meet it  and i was glad enough of everything
bright and cheering that i could get at to help me through 

 i wonder if there are many girls in the world who are nursing imaginary
miseries as i used to do   she went on   if there are  i should like to
tell them how foolish it is  and how bad for them  but  dear me  there
are so many girls and one can   get at them  i suppose each must learn
the lesson for herself and fight her fight out somehow  and i hope they
will all get through safely  and learn  as i have  that happiness is the
most precious thing in the world  and that it is so   so  foolish not to
enjoy and make the most of it while we have it  because  you know 
 some  day trouble must come to everybody  and it is such a pity to have
to look back and know that you have wasted a chance  




imprisoned 


the big house stood in the middle of a big open space  with wide lawns
about it shaded by cherry trees and lilac bushes  toward the south an
old fashioned garden  and back of that the apple orchard 

the little house was on the edge of the grounds  and had its front
entrance on the road  its doors were locked and its windows shuttered
now  for no one had lived in it for several years 

three little girls lived in the big house  lois  who was eight years
old  and emmy  who was seven  were sisters  kitty  their cousin  also
seven  had lived with them so long that she seemed like another sister 
there was  besides  marianne  the cook   baby  but as she was not quite
three  she did not count for much with the older ones  though they
sometimes condescended to play with her 

it was a place of endless pleasure to these happy country children  and
they needed no wider world than it afforded them  all summer long they
played in the open air  they built bowers in the feathery asparagus 
they knew every bird   nest in the syringa bushes and the thick
guelder roses  and were so busy all the time that they rarely found a
moment in which to quarrel 

one day in july their mother and father had occasion to leave home for a
long afternoon and evening 

 you can stay outdoors till half past six   mrs  spenser said to her
little girls   then you must come in to tea  and at half past seven you
must go to bed as usual  you may play where you like in the grounds  but
you must not go outside the gate   she kissed them for good by 
 remember to be good   she said  then she got into the carriage and
drove away 

the children were very good for several hours  they played that little
marianne was their baby  and was carried off by a gypsy  lois was the
gypsy  and the chase and recapture of the stolen child made an exciting
game 

at last they got tired of this  and the question arose   what shall we
do next  

 i wish mother would let us play down the road   said emmy   the noyse
children   mother lets them  

 i ll tell you what we ll do   said lois  struck by a sudden bright
idea   let   go down to the shut up house  that isn   outside the gate  

 o lois  yes  it is  you can   go to the front door without walking on
the road  

 well  who said anything about the front door  i   going to look in at
the back windows  mother never said we mustn   do that  

still  it was with a sense of guilt that the three stole across the
lawn  and they kept in the shadow of the hedge  as if afraid some one
would see and call them back  little marianne  with her rag doll in her
arms  began to run after them 

 there   that little plague tagging us   said kitty 

 go back  marianne  we don   want you   then  when marianne would not go
back  they all ran away  and left her crying 

the shut up house looked dull and ghostly enough  the front was in deep
shadow from the tall row of elms that bordered the road  but at the
back the sun shone hotly  it glowed through the low  dusty window of a
cellar  and danced and gleamed on something bright which lay on the
floor within 

 what do you suppose it is   said emmy  as they all stooped to look   it
looks like real gold  perhaps some pirates hid it there  and no one has
come since but us  

 or perhaps it   a mine   cried lois    a mine of jewels  see  it   all
purple  like the stones in mother   breastpin  wouldn   it be fun if it
was  we wouldn   tell anybody  and we could buy such splendid things  

 we must get in and find out   added kitty 

just then a wail sounded close at hand  and a very woful  tear stained
little figure appeared  it was marianne  the poor baby had trotted all
the long distance in the sun after her unkind playfellows 

 oh  dear  you little nuisance  what made you come   demanded emmy 

 i  ant to   was all marianne   explanation 

 well  don   cry  now you ve come  you can play   remarked lois  and
marianne was consoled 

they began to try the windows in turn  and at last found one in a
wood shed which was unfastened  kitty scrambled in  and admitted the
others  first into the wood shed and then into a very dusty kitchen  the
cellar stairs opened from this  they all ran down  but  oh 
disappointment   the jewel mine proved to be only the half of a broken
teacup with a pattern on it in gold and lilac  this was a terrible
come down from a pirate treasure 

 pshaw   said kitty   only an old piece of crockery  i don   think it  
fair to cheat like that  

little marianne had been afraid to venture down into the cellar  and now
stayed at the top waiting for them 

 let   run away from her   suggested kitty  who was cross after her
disappointment 

so they all hopped over marianne  and  deaf to her cries  ran upstairs
to the second story as fast as they could go  there were four bare 
dusty chambers  all unfurnished 

 there she comes   cried kitty  as marianne was heard climbing the
stairs   where shall we hide from her  oh  here   a place  

she had spied a closet door  fastened with a large old fashioned iron
latch  she flew across the room  it was a narrow closet  with a shelf
across the top of it 

 hurry  hurry   called kitty  the others made haste  they squeezed
themselves into the closet  and banged the door to behind them  not till
it was firmly fastened did they notice that there was no latch inside 
or handle of any sort  and that they had shut themselves in  and had no
possible way of getting out again 

their desire to escape from marianne changed at once into dismay  they
kicked and pounded  but the stout old fashioned door did not yield 
marianne could be heard crying without  there was a round hole in the
door just above the latch  putting her eye to this  lois could see the
poor little thing  doll in arms  standing in the middle of the floor 
uncertain what to do 

 marianne   she called   here we are  in the closet  come and let us
out  that   a good baby  put your little hand up and push the latch  you
can  if you will only try  

 i ll show you how   added kitty  taking her turn at the peep hole 
 see  come close to the door  and kitty will tell you what to do  

but these mysterious voices speaking out of the unseen frightened
marianne too much to allow of her doing anything helpful 

 i tan    i tan     she wailed  not venturing near the door 

 oh  do try  please do   pleaded lois   i ll give you my china doll if
you will  marianne  

 and i ll give you my doll   bedstead   added emmy   you   like that  i
know  dear little marianne  do try to let us out  please do  we re so
tired of this old closet  

but still marianne repeated   tan    tan     and at last she sat down on
the floor and wept  the imprisoned children wept with her 

 i ve thought of a plan   said emmy at last   if you ll break one of the
teeth out of your shell comb  lois  i think i can push it through the
hole and raise the latch up  

alas  the hole was above the latch  not below it  half the teeth were
broken out of lois   comb in their attempt  and with no result except
that they fell through the hole to the floor outside  at intervals they
renewed their banging and pounding on the door  but it only tired them
out  and did no good 

it was a very warm afternoon  and  as time went on  the closet became
unendurably hot  emmy sank down exhausted on the floor  and she and
kitty began to sob wildly  lois alone kept her calmness  little marianne
had grown wonderfully quiet  peeping through the hole  lois saw that she
had gone to sleep on the floor 

 don   cry so  kitty   she said   it   no use  we were naughty to come
here  i suppose we ve got to die in this closet  and it is my fault  we
shall starve to death pretty soon  and no one will know what has become
of us till somebody takes the house  and when they come to clean it and
they open the closet door  they will find our bones  

kitty screamed louder than ever at this terrible picture 

 oh  hush   said her cousin   the only thing we can do now is to pray 
god is the only person that can help us  mamma says he is close to every
person who prays  he can hear us if we are in the closet  

then lois made this little prayer   

 our father who art in heaven  we have been naughty  and came down here
when mamma didn   give us leave to come  but please forgive us  we won  
disobey again  if only thou wilt  we make a promise  help us  show us
the way to get out of this closet  don   let us die here  with no one to
know where we are  we ask it for jesus christ   sake  forever and
forever  amen  

it was a droll little prayer  but lois put all her heart into it  a
human listener might have smiled at the odd turn of the phrases  but god
knew what she meant  and he never turns away from real prayer  he
answered lois 

how did he answer her  did he send a strong angel to lift up the latch
of the door  he might have done that  you know  as he did for peter in
prison  but that was not the way he chose in this instance  what he did
was to put a thought into lois   mind 

she stood silent for a while after she had finished praying 

 children   she said   i have thought of something  kitty  you are the
lightest  do you think emmy and i could push you up on to the shelf  

it was not an easy thing to do  for the place was narrow  but at last 
with lois and emmy  boosting   and kitty scrambling  it was
accomplished 

 now  kitty  put your back against the wall   said lois   and when i say
 one  two  three   push the door with your feet as hard as you can 
while we push below  

kitty braced herself  and at the word  three   they all exerted their
utmost strength  one second more  and  oh  joy   the latch gave way  and
the door flew open  kitty tumbled from the shelf  the others fell
forward on the floor   they were out  lois had bumped her head  and
emmy   shoulder was bruised  but what was that  they were free 

 let us run  run   cried lois  catching marianne up in her arms   i
never want to see this horrible house again  

so they ran downstairs  and out through the wood shed into the open air 
oh  how sweet the sunshine looked  and the wind felt  after their fear
and danger 

their mother taught them a little verse next morning  after they had
told her all about their adventure and made confession of their fault 
and lois said it to herself every day all her life afterward  this is
it   

     god is never far away 
     god is listening all the day 
     when we tremble  when we fear 
     the dear lord is quick to hear   
     quick to hear  and quick to save 
       quick to grant each prayer we make 
     for the precious gift he gave 
       for his son our saviour   sake  

 i love that hymn   lois used to say   and i know it   true  because god
heard us just as well in that little bit of a closet as if we had been
in church  




a child of the sea folk 


the great storm of 1430 had done its worst  for days the tempest had
raged on land and sea  and when at last the sun struggled through the
clouds  broken now and flying in angry masses before the strong sea
wind  his beams revealed a scene of desolation 

all along the coast of friesland the dikes were down  and the salt water
washing over what but a few days before had been vegetable gardens and
fertile fields  the farm houses on the higher ground stood each on its
own little island as it were  with shallow waves breaking against the
walls of barns and stoned sheepfolds lower down on the slopes  already
busy hands were at work repairing the dykes  men in boats were wading up
to their knees in mud and water  men  swimming their horses across the
deeper pools  were carrying materials and urging on the work  but many
days must pass before the damage could be made good  and meanwhile  how
were people to manage for food and firing  with the peat stacks under
water  and the cabbages and potatoes spoiled by the wet 

 there is just this one thing   said metje huyt to her sister
jacqueline   little karen shall have her cup of warm milk to night if
everybody else goes without supper  on that i am determined  

 that will be good  but how canst thou manage it   asked jacqueline  a
gentle  placid girl of sixteen  with a rosy face and a plait of thick 
fair hair hanging down to her waist  metje was a year younger  but she
ruled her elder sister with a rod of iron by virtue of her superior
activity and vivacity of mind 

 i shall manage it in this way   i shall milk the electoral princess  

 but she is drowned   objected jacqueline  opening wide a pair of
surprised blue eyes 

 drowned  not at all  she is on that little hump of land over there
which looks like an island  but is really neighbor livard   high
clover patch  i mean to row out and milk her  and thou shalt go with
me  

 art thou sure that it is the electoral princess  and not any other
cow   asked jacqueline 

 sure  have i not a pair of eyes in my head  sure  don   i know the
twist of our own cow   horns  oh  jacque  jacque   what were thy blue
saucers given thee for  thee never seemest to use them to purpose 
however  come along  karen must not want for her milk any longer  the
mother was making some gruel water for her when i came away  and karen
did not like it  and was crying  

some wading was necessary to reach the row boat  which fortunately had
been dragged up to the great barn for repairs before the storm began 
and so had escaped the fate which had befallen most of the other boats
in the neighborhood   of being swept out to sea in the reflux of the
first furious tide  the barn was surrounded by water now  but it was
nowhere more than two or three inches deep  and pulling off their wooden
shoes  the sisters splashed through it with merry laughter  like most
friesland maidens  they were expert with the oar  and  though the waves
were still rough  they made their way without trouble to the wet green
slope where the electoral princess was grazing  raising her head from
time to time to utter a long melancholy moo of protest at the long delay
of her milkers  very glad was she to see the girls  and she rubbed her
head contentedly against jacqueline   shoulder while metje  with gentle 
skilful fingers  filled the pail with foaming milk 

 now stay quietly and go on eating friend livard   clover  since no
better may be   she said  patting the cow   red side   the water is
going down  the dikes are rebuilding  presently we will come and take
thee back to the home field  meanwhile each day jacque and i will row
out and milk thee  so be a good cow and stay contentedly where thou
art  

 what can that be   jacqueline asked after the sisters had proceeded a
short distance on their homeward way 

 what  

 that thing over there   and she pointed toward a distant pool some
quarter of a mile from them and still nearer to the sea   it looks
like  like  oh  metje  do you think it can be some one who has been
drowned  

 no   for it moves   it lifts its arm   said metje  shading her eyes
from the level rays of the sun  and looking steadily seaward 

 it is a girl  she is caught by the tide in the pool  row  jacqueline 
row  the tide turns in half an hour  and then she will be drowned
indeed  the water was very deep out there last night when the flood was
full  i heard voorst say so  

the heavy boat flew forward  for the sisters bent to the oars with all
their strength  jacqueline turned her head from time to time  to judge
of their direction and the distance 

 it   no neighbor   she answered as they drew nearer   it   no one i
ever saw before  metje  it is the strangest looking maiden you ever saw 
her hair is long   so long  and her face is wild to look upon  i am
afraid  

 never mind her hair  we must save her  however long it is   gasped
metje  breathless from the energy of her exertions   steady  now 
jacque  here we are  hold the boat by the reeds  girl  i say  girl  do
you hear me  we are come to help you  

the girl  for a girl it was who half sat  half floated in the pool 
raised herself out of the water as one alive  and stared at the sisters
without speaking  she was indeed a wild and strange looking creature 
quite different from any one that they had ever seen before 

 well  are you not going to get into the boat   cried metje   are you
deaf  maiden  that you do not answer me  you ll be drowned presently 
though you swam like forty fishes  for the tide will be coming in like
fury through yon breach in the dike  here  let me help you  give me your
hand  

the strange girl did not reply  but she seemed to understand a part  at
least  of what was said to her  she moaned  her face contracted as if
with pain  and  raising herself still farther from the water with an
effort  she indicated by signs that she was caught in the mud at the
bottom of the pool and could not set herself free 

this was a serious situation  for  as metje well knew  the mud was deep
and adhesive  she sat a moment in thought  then she took her oar  forced
the boat still nearer  and  directing jacqueline to throw her weight on
the farther edge to avoid an upset  she grasped the cold hands which the
stranger held out  and  exerting her full strength  drew her from the
mud and over the side of the boat  it rocked fearfully under her
weight  the milk splashed from the pail  but the danger was over in half
a minute  and the rescued girl  exhausted and half dead  lay safely on
the bottom 

 dear me  she will freeze   cried jacqueline hastily  for the poor thing
they had saved was without clothing  save for the long hair which hung
about her like a mantle   here  metje  i can spare my cloak to wrap
round her limbs  and she must put on thy jacket  we will row the harder
to keep ourselves warm  

rowing hard was indeed needful  for  summer as it was  the wind  as the
sun sank  blew in icy gusts from the zetland zee  whirling the sailless
windmills rapidly round  and sending showers of salt spray over the
walls of the sheepfolds and other outlying enclosures  the sisters were
thoroughly chilled before they had pulled the boat up to a place of
safety and helped the half drowned stranger across the wet slope of
grass to the house door 

their mother was looking out for them 

 where hast thou been  children   she asked   ach   with a look of
satisfaction as metje slipped the handle of the milk pail between her
fingers   that is well  little karen was wearying for her supper  but
who hast thou here   looking curiously at the odd figure whom her
daughters were supporting 

 oh  mother  it is a poor thing that we saved from drowning in that pool
over there   explained metje  pointing seaward   she is a stranger  from
far away it must be  for she understands not our speech  and answers
nothing when we ask her questions  

 dear me  what should bring a stranger here at this stormy time  but
whoever she is  she must needs be warmed and fed   and the good vrow
hurried them all indoors  where a carefully economized fire of peats was
burning  the main stock of peats was under water still  and it behooved
them to be careful of what remained  the father had said 

 we shall have to lend her some clothes   said metje in an embarrassed
tone   hers must have been lost in the water somehow  

 perhaps she went in to bathe  and the tide carried them away  
suggested jacqueline 

 bathe  in a tempest such as there has not been in my time  bathe  thou
art crazed  child  it is singular  most singular  i don   like it  
muttered the puzzled mother   well  what needs be must be  go and fetch
thy old stuff petticoat  metje  and one of my homespun shifts  and
there   that old red jacket of jacqueline    she must have that  i
suppose  make haste  before the father comes in  

it was easier to fetch the clothes than to persuade the strange girl to
put them on  she moaned  she resisted  she was as awkward and ill at
ease as though she had never worn anything of the sort before  now that
they scanned her more closely there seemed something very unusual about
her make  her arms hung down   like flippers  metje whispered to her
sister  she stumbled when she tried to walk alone  it seemed as though
her feet  which looked only half developed  could scarcely support her
weight 

for all that  when she was dressed  with her long hair dried  braided 
and bound with a scarlet ribbon  there was something appealing and
attractive in the poor child   face  she seemed to like the fire  and
cowered close to it  when milk was offered her  she drank with avidity 
but she would not touch the slice of black bread which metje brought 
and instead caught up a raw shell fish from a pail full which voorst
had scooped out of the pool of sea water which covered what had been the
cabbage bed  and ate it greedily  the mother looked grave as she watched
her  and was troubled in her mind 

 she seems scarce human   she whispered to metje  drawing her to a
distant corner  though indeed they might have spoken aloud with no fear
of being understood by the stranger  who evidently knew no dutch   she
is like no maiden that ever i saw  

 perhaps she is english   suggested metje  who had never seen any one
from england  but had vaguely heard that it was an odd country quite
different from friesland 

the mother shook her head   she is not english  i have seen one english
that time that thy father and i went to haarlem about thy grand uncle  
inheritance  it was a woman  and she was not at all like this girl 
metje  but that thou wouldst laugh  and father pettrie might reprove me
for vain imaginations  i should guess her to be one of those mermaidens
of whom our forefathers have told us  there are such creatures   my
mother   great aunt saw one with her own eyes  and wrote it down  and
my mother kept the paper  often have i read it over  it was off the
texel  

 could she really be that  why  it would be better  more interesting  i
mean  than to have her an englishwoman   cried metje   we would teach
her to spin  to knit  she should go with us to church and learn the ave 
would it not be a good and holy work  mother  to save the soul of a poor
wild thing from the waves where they know not how to pray  

 perhaps   replied the vrow  doubtfully  she could not quite accustom
herself to her own suggestion  yet could not quite dismiss it from her
mind 

the father and voorst now came in  and supper  delayed till after its
usual time by the pressing needs of the stranger  must be got ready in
haste 

metje fell to slicing the black loaf  jacqueline stirred the porridge 
while the mother herself presided over the pot of cabbage soup which had
been stewing over the fire since early morning  voorst  meanwhile 
having nothing to do but to wait  sat and looked furtively at the
strange girl  she did not seem to notice him  but remained motionless in
the chimney corner  only now and then giving a startled sudden glance
about the room  like some wild creature caught in a trap  voorst thought
he had never seen anything so plaintive as her large  frightened eyes 
or so wonderful as the thick plait of hair which  as she sat  lay on the
ground  and was of the strangest pale color  like flax on which a
greenish reflection is accidentally thrown  it was no more like metje  
ruddy locks  or the warm fairness of jacqueline   braids  than moonlight
is like dairy butter  he said to himself 

supper ready  metje took the girl   hand and led her to the table  she
submitted to be placed on a wooden stool  and looked curiously at the
bowl of steaming broth which was set before her  but she made no attempt
to eat it  and seemed not to know the use of her spoon  metje tried to
show her how to hold it  but she only moaned restlessly  and  as soon as
the family moved after the father had pronounced the latin grace which
father pettrie taught all his flock to employ  she slipped from her seat
and stumbled awkwardly across the floor toward the fire  which seemed to
have a fascination for her 

 poor thing  she seems unlearnt in christian ways   said goodman huyt 
but later  when his wife confided to him her notion as to the
stranger   uncanny origin  he looked perplexed  crossed himself  and
said he would speak to the priest in the morning  it was no time for
fetching heathen folk into homes  he remarked  still less those who were
more fish than folk  as for mermaids  if such things there might be 
they were no better in his opinion than dolphins or mackerel  and he did
not care to countenance them 

father pettrie was duly consulted  he scouted the mermaid theory  and 
as the vrow had foreboded  gave her a reprimand for putting such ideas
into the mind of her family 

the girl was evidently a foreigner from some far distant country  he
said  a turk it might be  or a daughter of that people  descended from
ishmael  who held rule in the land of the holy sepulchre  all the more
it became a duty to teach her christian ways and bring her into the true
fold  and he bade goodman huyt to keep her till such time as her friends
should be found  to treat her kindly  and make sure that she was brought
regularly to church and taught religion and her duty 

there was no need of this admonition as to kindness  vrow huyt could
hardly have used a stray dog less than tenderly  and for jacqueline and
metje  they looked upon the girl as their own special property  and were
only in danger of spoiling her with over indulgence   ebba   they called
her  as they knew no name by which to address her  and in course of time
she learned to recognize it as hers and to answer to it   answer by
looks and signs  that is  for she never learned to speak  or to make
other sound than inarticulate moans and murmurs  except a wild sort of
laughter  and now and then  when pleased and contented  a low humming
noise like an undeveloped song  from these the family could guess at her
mood  from her expressive looks and gestures they made shift to
understand her wishes  and she  in turn  comprehended their meaning half
by observation  half by instinct  but closer communication was not
possible  and the lack of a common speech was a barrier between them
which neither she nor they could overcome 

gradually  dumb ebba   as the neighbors called her  was taught some of
the thrifty household arts in which dame huyt excelled  she learned to
spin  and though less expertly  to knit  and could be trusted to stir
whatever was set upon the fire to cook  and not let it burn or boil
over  when the family went to mass  she went too  limping along with
painful slowness on her badly formed feet  and she bowed her head and
knelt with the rest  but how much or how little she understood they
could not tell  except on sundays she never left the house  her first
attempts at doing so were checked by metje  who could not dismiss from
her memory what her mother had said  and was afraid to let her charge so
much as look toward the tempting blue waves which shone in the distance 
and after a while ebba seemed to realize that she was  so to speak  a
kindly treated captive  and resigned herself to captivity  little karen
was the only creature whom she played with  sometimes when busied with
the child she was noticed to smile  but for every one else her face
remained pitifully sad  and she never lost the look of a wild 
imprisoned thing 

so two years passed  and still dumb ebba remained  unclaimed by friends
or kindred  one of the friendly huyt household  the dikes were long
since rebuilt  the electoral princess had come back to her own
pasture ground and fed there contentedly in company with two of her own
calves  but the poor sea stray whom metje had pulled into the boat that
stormy night remained speechless  inscrutable  a mystery and a
perplexity to her adopted family 

but now a fresh interest arose to rival ebba   claims on their
attention  a wooer came for pretty jacqueline  it was young hans polder 
son of a thrifty miller in the neighborhood  and himself owner of one of
the best windmills in that part of friesland  jacqueline was not hard to
win  the wedding day was set  and she  metje  and the mother were busy
from morning till night in making ready the store of household linen
which was the marriage portion of all well to do brides  ebba   services
with the wheel were also put into requisition  and part of her spinning 
woven into towels  which  after a fancy of metje    had a pattern of
little fish all over them  were known for generations as  the mermaid  
towels   but this is running far in advance of my story 

amid this press of occupation ebba was necessarily left to herself more
than formerly  and some dormant sense of loneliness  perhaps  made her
turn to voorst as a friend  he had taken a fancy to her at the
first   the sort of fancy which a manly youth sometimes takes to a
helpless child   and had always treated her kindly  now she grew to
feel for him a degree of attachment which she showed for no one else  in
the evening  when tired after the day   fishing he sat half asleep by
the fire  she would crouch on the floor beside him  watching his every
movement  and perfectly content if  on waking  he threw her a word or
patted her hair carelessly  she sometimes neglected to fill the father  
glass or fetch his pipe  but never voorst    and she heard his footsteps
coming up from the dike long before any one else in the house could
catch the slightest footfall 

the strict watch which the family had at first kept over their singular
inmate had gradually relaxed  and ebba was suffered to go in and out at
her will  she rarely ventured beyond the house enclosure  however  but
was fond of sitting on the low wall of the sheep fold and looking off at
the sea  which  now that the flood had subsided  was at a long distance
from the house  and at such moments her eyes looked larger  wilder  and
more wistful than ever 

as the time for the wedding drew near  voorst fell into the way of
absenting himself a good deal from home  there were errands to be done 
he said  but as these  errands  always took him over to the little
island of urk  where lived a certain pretty olla tronk  who was
jacqueline   great friend and her chosen bridesmaiden  the sisters
naturally teased him a good deal about them  ebba did not  of course 
understand these jokings  but she seemed to feel instinctively that
something was in the air  she grew restless  the old unhappy moan came
back to her lips  only when voorst was at home did she seem more
contented 

three days before the marriage  olla arrived to help in the last
preparations  she was one of the handsomest girls in the neighborhood 
and besides her beauty was an heiress  for her father  whose only child
she was  owned large tracts of pasture on the mainland  as well as the
greater part of the island of urk  where he had a valuable dairy  the
family crowded to the door to welcome olla  she came in with voorst  who
had rowed over to urk for her   tall  blooming  with flaxen tresses
hanging below her waist  and a pair of dancing hazel eyes fringed with
long lashes  voorst was almost as good looking in his way   they made a
very handsome couple 

 and this must be the stranger maiden of whom voorst has so often told
me   said olla after the first greetings had been exchanged  she smiled
at ebba  and tried to take her hand  but the elfish creature frowned 
retreated  and  when olla persisted  snatched her hand away with an
angry gesture and put it behind her back 

 why does she dislike me so   asked olla  discomfited and grieved  for
she had meant to be kind 

 oh  she doesn   dislike thee  she couldn     cried peace loving
jacqueline 

but ebba did dislike olla  though no one understood why  she would
neither go near nor look at her if she could help it  and when  in the
evening  she and voorst sat on the doorstep talking together in low
tones  ebba hastened out  placed herself between them  and tried to push
olla away  uttering pitiful little wailing cries 

 what does ail her   asked jacqueline  metje made no answer  but she
looked troubled  she felt that there was sorrow ahead for ebba or for
voorst  and she loved them both 

the wedding day dawned clear and cloudless  as a marriage day should 
jacqueline in her bravery of stiff gilded head dress with its long
scarf like veil  her snowy bodice  and necklace of many colored beads 
was a dazzling figure  olla was scarcely less so  and she blushed and
dimpled as voorst led her along in the bridal procession  ebba walked
behind them  she  too  had been made fine in a scarlet bodice and a
grand cap with wings like that which metje wore  but she did not seem to
care that she was so well dressed  her sad eyes followed the forms of
olla and voorst  and as she limped painfully along after them  she
moaned continually to herself  a low  inarticulate  wordless murmur like
the sound of the sea 

following the marriage mass came the marriage feast  goodman huyt sat at
the head of the table  the mother at the foot  and  side by side  the
newly wedded pair  opposite them sat voorst and olla  his expression of
triumphant satisfaction  and her blushes and demurely contented glances 
had not been unobserved by the guests  so no one was very much surprised
when  in the midst of the festivity  the father rose  and knocked with
his tankard on the table to insure silence 

 neighbors and kinsfolk  one marriage maketh another  saith the old
proverb  and we are like to prove it a true one  i hereby announce that 
with consent of parents on both sides  my son voorst is troth plight
with olla the daughter of my old friend tronk who sits here    slapping
tronk on the shoulder    and i would now ask you to drink with me a
high health to the young couple   suiting the action to the word  he
filled the glass with hollands  raised it  pronounced the toast   a
high health to voorst huyt and to his bride olla tronk   and swallowed
the spirits at a draught 

ebba  who against her will had been made to sit at the board among the
other guests  had listened to this speech with no understanding of its
meaning  but as she listened to the laughter and applause which followed
it  and saw people slapping voorst on the back with loud congratulations
and shaking hands with olla  she raised her head with a flash of
interest  she watched voorst rise in his place with olla by his side 
while the rest reseated themselves  she heard him utter a few sentences 
what they meant she knew not  but he looked at olla  and when  after
draining his glass  he turned  put his arm round olla   neck  drew her
head close to his own  and their lips met in a kiss  some meaning of the
ceremony seemed to burst upon her  she started from her seat  for one
moment she stood motionless with dilated eyes and parted lips  then she
gave a long wild cry and fled from the house 

 what is the matter  who screamed   asked old huyt  who had observed
nothing 

 it is nothing  the poor dumb child over there   answered his wife 

metje looked anxiously at the door  the duties of hospitality held her
to her place   she will come in presently and i will comfort her   she
thought to herself 

but ebba never  came in  again  when metje was set free to search  all
trace of her had vanished  as suddenly and mysteriously as she had come
into their lives she had passed out of them again  no one had seen her
go forth from the door  no trace could be found of her on land or sea 
only an old fisherman  who was drawing his nets that day at a little
distance from the shore  averred that just after high noon he had
noticed a shape wearing a fluttering garment like that of a woman pass
slowly over the ridge of the dike just where it made a sudden curve to
the left  he had had the curiosity to row that way after his net was
safely pulled in  for he wanted to see if there was a boat lying there 
or what could take any one to so unlikely a spot  but neither boat nor
woman could be found  and he half fancied that he must have fallen
asleep in broad daylight and dreamed for a moment 

however that might be  ebba was gone  nor was anything ever known of her
again  metje mourned her loss  all the more that jacqueline   departure
left her with no mate of her own age in the household  little karen
cried for  ebbe  for a night or two  the vrow missed her aid in the
spinning  but voorst  absorbed in his happiness  scarcely noted her
absence  and olla was glad 

gradually she grew to be a tradition of the neighborhood  handed down
from one generation to another even to this day  and nobody ever knew
whence she came or where she went  or whether it was a mortal maiden or
one of the children of the strange  solemn sea folk who was cast so
curiously upon the hands of the kindly friesland family and dwelt in
their midst for two speechless years 

    note   the tradition on which this story is founded  and which
    is still held as true in some parts of friesland  is referred to
    by parival in his book   les delices de hollande

louisa    alcott   writings 


 miss alcott is really a benefactor of households         

 miss alcott has a faculty of entering into the lives and feelings of
children that is conspicuously wanting in most writers who address them 
and to this cause  to the consciousness among her readers that they are
hearing about people like themselves  instead of abstract qualities
labelled with names  the popularity of her books is due    mrs  sarah

book the first  recalled to life




i  the period


it was the best of times 
it was the worst of times 
it was the age of wisdom 
it was the age of foolishness 
it was the epoch of belief 
it was the epoch of incredulity 
it was the season of light 
it was the season of darkness 
it was the spring of hope 
it was the winter of despair 
we had everything before us 
we had nothing before us 
we were all going direct to heaven 
we were all going direct the other way  
in short  the period was so far like the present period  that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received  for good or for
evil  in the superlative degree of comparison only 

there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face  on the
throne of england  there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face  on the throne of france  in both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the state preserves of loaves and fishes 
that things in general were settled for ever 

it was the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy five 
spiritual revelations were conceded to england at that favoured period 
as at this  mrs  southcott had recently attained her five and twentieth
blessed birthday  of whom a prophetic private in the life guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of london and westminster  even the cock lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years  after rapping out its
messages  as the spirits of this very year last past  supernaturally
deficient in originality  rapped out theirs  mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the english crown and people 
from a congress of british subjects in america  which  strange
to relate  have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the cock lane
brood 

france  less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident  rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill  making paper money and spending it  under the guidance of her
christian pastors  she entertained herself  besides  with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off  his tongue
torn out with pincers  and his body burned alive  because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view  at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards  it is likely enough that  rooted in the woods of france and
norway  there were growing trees  when that sufferer was put to death 
already marked by the woodman  fate  to come down and be sawn into
boards  to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it  terrible in history  it is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to paris  there were
sheltered from the weather that very day  rude carts  bespattered with
rustic mire  snuffed about by pigs  and roosted in by poultry  which
the farmer  death  had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the revolution  but that woodman and that farmer  though they work
unceasingly  work silently  and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread  the rather  forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake  was to be atheistical and traitorous 

in england  there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting  daring burglaries by armed men  and
highway robberies  took place in the capital itself every night 
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers  warehouses for security  the highwayman
in the dark was a city tradesman in the light  and  being recognised and
challenged by his fellow tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
 the captain   gallantly shot him through the head and rode away  the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers  and the guard shot three dead  and
then got shot dead himself by the other four   in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition   after which the mail was robbed in peace 
that magnificent potentate  the lord mayor of london  was made to stand
and deliver on turnham green  by one highwayman  who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue  prisoners in london
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys  and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them  loaded with rounds of shot and ball 
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
court drawing rooms  musketeers went into st  giles    to search
for contraband goods  and the mob fired on the musketeers  and the
musketeers fired on the mob  and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way  in the midst of them  the hangman  ever busy
and ever worse than useless  was in constant requisition  now  stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals  now  hanging a housebreaker on
saturday who had been taken on tuesday  now  burning people in the
hand at newgate by the dozen  and now burning pamphlets at the door of
westminster hall  to day  taking the life of an atrocious murderer 
and to morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer   boy of
sixpence 

all these things  and a thousand like them  came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy five 
environed by them  while the woodman and the farmer worked unheeded 
those two of the large jaws  and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces  trod with stir enough  and carried their divine rights
with a high hand  thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy five conduct their greatnesses  and myriads of small
creatures  the creatures of this chronicle among the rest  along the
roads that lay before them 




ii  the mail


it was the dover road that lay  on a friday night late in november 
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business 
the dover road lay  as to him  beyond the dover mail  as it lumbered up
shooter   hill  he walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail 
as the rest of the passengers did  not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise  under the circumstances  but because the hill 
and the harness  and the mud  and the mail  were all so heavy  that the
horses had three times already come to a stop  besides once drawing the
coach across the road  with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to blackheath  reins and whip and coachman and guard  however  in
combination  had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument  that some brute animals
are endued with reason  and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty 

with drooping heads and tremulous tails  they mashed their way through
the thick mud  floundering and stumbling between whiles  as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints  as often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand  with a wary  wo ho  so ho then   the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it  like an
unusually emphatic horse  denying that the coach could be got up the
hill  whenever the leader made this rattle  the passenger started  as a
nervous passenger might  and was disturbed in mind 

there was a steaming mist in all the hollows  and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill  like an evil spirit  seeking rest and finding
none  a clammy and intensely cold mist  it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another  as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do  it was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach lamps but these its own workings 
and a few yards of road  and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it  as if they had made it all 

two other passengers  besides the one  were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail  all three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears  and wore jack boots  not one of the three could have said  from
anything he saw  what either of the other two was like  and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind  as from
the eyes of the body  of his two companions  in those days  travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice  for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers  as to the latter 
when every posting house and ale house could produce somebody in
 the captain    pay  ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non descript  it was the likeliest thing upon the cards  so the guard
of the dover mail thought to himself  that friday night in november  one
thousand seven hundred and seventy five  lumbering up shooter   hill  as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail  beating his feet 
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm chest before him  where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse pistols 
deposited on a substratum of cutlass 

the dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers  the passengers suspected one another and the guard  they
all suspected everybody else  and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses  as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two testaments that they were not fit for the
journey 

 wo ho   said the coachman   so  then  one more pull and you re at the
top and be damned to you  for i have had trouble enough to get you to
it   joe  

 halloa   the guard replied 

 what o clock do you make it  joe  

 ten minutes  good  past eleven  

 my blood   ejaculated the vexed coachman   and not atop of shooter  
yet  tst  yah  get on with you  

the emphatic horse  cut short by the whip in a most decided negative 
made a decided scramble for it  and the three other horses followed
suit  once more  the dover mail struggled on  with the jack boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side  they had stopped when the coach
stopped  and they kept close company with it  if any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness  he would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman 

the last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill  the horses
stopped to breathe again  and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent  and open the coach door to let the passengers in 

 tst  joe   cried the coachman in a warning voice  looking down from his
box 

 what do you say  tom  

they both listened 

 i say a horse at a canter coming up  joe  

  i  say a horse at a gallop  tom   returned the guard  leaving his hold
of the door  and mounting nimbly to his place   gentlemen  in the king  
name  all of you  

with this hurried adjuration  he cocked his blunderbuss  and stood on
the offensive 

the passenger booked by this history  was on the coach step  getting in 
the two other passengers were close behind him  and about to follow  he
remained on the step  half in the coach and half out of  they remained
in the road below him  they all looked from the coachman to the guard 
and from the guard to the coachman  and listened  the coachman looked
back and the guard looked back  and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his ears and looked back  without contradicting 

the stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach  added to the stillness of the night  made it very quiet
indeed  the panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach  as if it were in a state of agitation  the hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard  but at any rate  the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath  and holding
the breath  and having the pulses quickened by expectation 

the sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill 

 so ho   the guard sang out  as loud as he could roar   yo there  stand 
i shall fire  

the pace was suddenly checked  and  with much splashing and floundering 
a man   voice called from the mist   is that the dover mail  

 never you mind what it is   the guard retorted   what are you  

  is  that the dover mail  

 why do you want to know  

 i want a passenger  if it is  

 what passenger  

 mr  jarvis lorry  

our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name  the guard 
the coachman  and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully 

 keep where you are   the guard called to the voice in the mist 
 because  if i should make a mistake  it could never be set right in
your lifetime  gentleman of the name of lorry answer straight  

 what is the matter   asked the passenger  then  with mildly quavering
speech   who wants me  is it jerry  

  i don   like jerry   voice  if it is jerry   growled the guard to
himself   he   hoarser than suits me  is jerry   

 yes  mr  lorry  

 what is the matter  

 a despatch sent after you from over yonder     and co  

 i know this messenger  guard   said mr  lorry  getting down into the
road  assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers  who immediately scrambled into the coach  shut the door  and
pulled up the window   he may come close  there   nothing wrong  

 i hope there ain    but i can   make so  nation sure of that   said the
guard  in gruff soliloquy   hallo you  

 well  and hallo you   said jerry  more hoarsely than before 

 come on at a footpace    ye mind me  and if you ve got holsters to that
saddle o  yourn  don   let me see your hand go nigh  em  for i   a devil
at a quick mistake  and when i make one it takes the form of lead  so
now let   look at you  

the figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist 
and came to the side of the mail  where the passenger stood  the rider
stooped  and  casting up his eyes at the guard  handed the passenger
a small folded paper  the rider   horse was blown  and both horse and
rider were covered with mud  from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man 

 guard   said the passenger  in a tone of quiet business confidence 

the watchful guard  with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss  his left at the barrel  and his eye on the horseman 
answered curtly   sir  

 there is nothing to apprehend  i belong to tellson   bank  you must
know tellson   bank in london  i am going to paris on business  a crown
to drink  i may read this  

 if so be as you re quick  sir  

he opened it in the light of the coach lamp on that side  and
read  first to himself and then aloud    wait at dover for mam selle  
it   not long  you see  guard  jerry  say that my answer was  recalled
to life  

jerry started in his saddle   that   a blazing strange answer  too  
said he  at his hoarsest 

 take that message back  and they will know that i received this  as
well as if i wrote  make the best of your way  good night  

with those words the passenger opened the coach door and got in  not at
all assisted by his fellow passengers  who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots  and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep  with no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action 

the coach lumbered on again  with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent  the guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm chest  and  having looked to the rest of its contents  and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt 
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat  in which there were a
few smith   tools  a couple of torches  and a tinder box  for he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach lamps had been blown
and stormed out  which did occasionally happen  he had only to shut
himself up inside  keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw 
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease  if he were lucky  in
five minutes 

 tom   softly over the coach roof 

 hallo  joe  

 did you hear the message  

 i did  joe  

 what did you make of it  tom  

 nothing at all  joe  

 that   a coincidence  too   the guard mused   for i made the same of it
myself  

jerry  left alone in the mist and darkness  dismounted meanwhile  not
only to ease his spent horse  but to wipe the mud from his face  and
shake the wet out of his hat brim  which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon  after standing with the bridle over his
heavily splashed arm  until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again  he turned to walk down the
hill 

 after that there gallop from temple bar  old lady  i won   trust your
fore legs till i get you on the level   said this hoarse messenger 
glancing at his mare    recalled to life   that   a blazing strange
message  much of that wouldn   do for you  jerry  i say  jerry  you  
be in a blazing bad way  if recalling to life was to come into fashion 
jerry  




iii  the night shadows


a wonderful fact to reflect upon  that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other  a
solemn consideration  when i enter a great city by night  that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret  that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret  that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there  is  in some of
its imaginings  a secret to the heart nearest it  something of the
awfulness  even of death itself  is referable to this  no more can i
turn the leaves of this dear book that i loved  and vainly hope in time
to read it all  no more can i look into the depths of this unfathomable
water  wherein  as momentary lights glanced into it  i have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged  it was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring  for ever and for ever  when i had read
but a page  it was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost  when the light was playing on its surface  and i stood
in ignorance on the shore  my friend is dead  my neighbour is dead 
my love  the darling of my soul  is dead  it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality  and which i shall carry in mine to my life   end  in
any of the burial places of this city through which i pass  is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are  in their
innermost personality  to me  or than i am to them 

as to this  his natural and not to be alienated inheritance  the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the king  the
first minister of state  or the richest merchant in london  so with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach  they were mysteries to one another  as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six  or his own coach and sixty  with the
breadth of a county between him and the next 

the messenger rode back at an easy trot  stopping pretty often at
ale houses by the way to drink  but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel  and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes  he had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration  being of a surface black  with
no depth in the colour or form  and much too near together  as if they
were afraid of being found out in something  singly  if they kept too
far apart  they had a sinister expression  under an old cocked hat like
a three cornered spittoon  and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat  which descended nearly to the wearer   knees  when he stopped
for drink  he moved this muffler with his left hand  only while he
poured his liquor in with his right  as soon as that was done  he
muffled again 

 no  jerry  no   said the messenger  harping on one theme as he rode 
 it wouldn   do for you  jerry  jerry  you honest tradesman  it wouldn  
suit  your  line of business  recalled    bust me if i don   think he  
been a drinking  

his message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain  several
times  to take off his hat to scratch his head  except on the crown 
which was raggedly bald  he had stiff  black hair  standing jaggedly all
over it  and growing down hill almost to his broad  blunt nose  it was
so like smith   work  so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair  that the best of players at leap frog might
have declined him  as the most dangerous man in the world to go over 

while he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of tellson   bank  by temple bar  who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within  the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message  and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of  her  private topics of uneasiness 
they seemed to be numerous  for she shied at every shadow on the road 

what time  the mail coach lumbered  jolted  rattled  and bumped upon
its tedious way  with its three fellow inscrutables inside  to whom 
likewise  the shadows of the night revealed themselves  in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested 

tellson   bank had a run upon it in the mail  as the bank
passenger  with an arm drawn through the leathern strap  which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger 
and driving him into his corner  whenever the coach got a special
jolt  nodded in his place  with half shut eyes  the little
coach windows  and the coach lamp dimly gleaming through them  and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger  became the bank  and did a great
stroke of business  the rattle of the harness was the chink of money 
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even tellson    with
all its foreign and home connection  ever paid in thrice the time  then
the strong rooms underground  at tellson    with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger  and it was not a
little that he knew about them   opened before him  and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly burning candle  and found them
safe  and strong  and sound  and still  just as he had last seen them 

but  though the bank was almost always with him  and though the coach
 in a confused way  like the presence of pain under an opiate  was
always with him  there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run  all through the night  he was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave 

now  which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person  the shadows of the night did
not indicate  but they were all the faces of a man of five and forty by
years  and they differed principally in the passions they expressed 
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state  pride  contempt 
defiance  stubbornness  submission  lamentation  succeeded one another 
so did varieties of sunken cheek  cadaverous colour  emaciated hands
and figures  but the face was in the main one face  and every head was
prematurely white  a hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre 

 buried how long  

the answer was always the same   almost eighteen years  

 you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  

 long ago  

 you know that you are recalled to life  

 they tell me so  

 i hope you care to live  

 i can   say  

 shall i show her to you  will you come and see her  

the answers to this question were various and contradictory  sometimes
the broken reply was   wait  it would kill me if i saw her too soon  
sometimes  it was given in a tender rain of tears  and then it was 
 take me to her   sometimes it was staring and bewildered  and then it
was   i don   know her  i don   understand  

after such imaginary discourse  the passenger in his fancy would dig 
and dig  dig  now with a spade  now with a great key  now with his
hands  to dig this wretched creature out  got out at last  with earth
hanging about his face and hair  he would suddenly fan away to dust  the
passenger would then start to himself  and lower the window  to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek 

yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain  on the moving
patch of light from the lamps  and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks  the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within  the real banking house by temple bar  the
real business of the past day  the real strong rooms  the real express
sent after him  and the real message returned  would all be there  out
of the midst of them  the ghostly face would rise  and he would accost
it again 

 buried how long  

 almost eighteen years  

 i hope you care to live  

 i can   say  

dig  dig  dig  until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window  draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap  and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms  until his mind lost its hold of them  and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave 

 buried how long  

 almost eighteen years  

 you had abandoned all hope of being dug out  

 long ago  

the words were still in his hearing as just spoken  distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life  when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight  and found that the
shadows of the night were gone 

he lowered the window  and looked out at the rising sun  there was a
ridge of ploughed land  with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked  beyond  a quiet coppice wood 
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees  though the earth was cold and wet  the sky was clear 
and the sun rose bright  placid  and beautiful 

 eighteen years   said the passenger  looking at the sun   gracious
creator of day  to be buried alive for eighteen years  




iv  the preparation


when the mail got successfully to dover  in the course of the forenoon 
the head drawer at the royal george hotel opened the coach door as his
custom was  he did it with some flourish of ceremony  for a mail journey
from london in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon 

by that time  there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated  for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations  the mildewy inside of the coach  with its damp
and dirty straw  its disagreeable smell  and its obscurity  was rather
like a larger dog kennel  mr  lorry  the passenger  shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw  a tangle of shaggy wrapper  flapping hat  and
muddy legs  was rather like a larger sort of dog 

 there will be a packet to calais  tomorrow  drawer  

 yes  sir  if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair  the
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon  sir  bed 
sir  

 i shall not go to bed till night  but i want a bedroom  and a barber  

 and then breakfast  sir  yes  sir  that way  sir  if you please 
show concord  gentleman   valise and hot water to concord  pull off
gentleman   boots in concord   you will find a fine sea coal fire  sir  
fetch barber to concord  stir about there  now  for concord  

the concord bed chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail  and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot  the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
royal george  that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it 
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it  consequently  another
drawer  and two porters  and several maids and the landlady  were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the concord
and the coffee room  when a gentleman of sixty  formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes  pretty well worn  but very well kept  with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets  passed along on his way to
his breakfast 

the coffee room had no other occupant  that forenoon  than the gentleman
in brown  his breakfast table was drawn before the fire  and as he sat 
with its light shining on him  waiting for the meal  he sat so still 
that he might have been sitting for his portrait 

very orderly and methodical he looked  with a hand on each knee  and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist coat 
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire  he had a good leg  and was a little vain
of it  for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close  and were of a
fine texture  his shoes and buckles  too  though plain  were trim  he
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig  setting very close to his
head  which wig  it is to be presumed  was made of hair  but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass 
his linen  though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings 
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach  or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea  a
face habitually suppressed and quieted  was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner  in years gone by  some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of tellson   bank  he had a healthy colour in his
cheeks  and his face  though lined  bore few traces of anxiety 
but  perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in tellson   bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people  and perhaps
second hand cares  like second hand clothes  come easily off and on 

completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait 
mr  lorry dropped off to sleep  the arrival of his breakfast roused him 
and he said to the drawer  as he moved his chair to it 

 i wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to day  she may ask for mr  jarvis lorry  or she may only ask for a
gentleman from tellson   bank  please to let me know  

 yes  sir  tellson   bank in london  sir  

 yes  

 yes  sir  we have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt london and paris  sir  a
vast deal of travelling  sir  in tellson and company   house  

 yes  we are quite a french house  as well as an english one  

 yes  sir  not much in the habit of such travelling yourself  i think 
sir  

 not of late years  it is fifteen years since we  since i  came last
from france  

 indeed  sir  that was before my time here  sir  before our people  
time here  sir  the george was in other hands at that time  sir  

 i believe so  

 but i would hold a pretty wager  sir  that a house like tellson and
company was flourishing  a matter of fifty  not to speak of fifteen
years ago  

 you might treble that  and say a hundred and fifty  yet not be far from
the truth  

 indeed  sir  

rounding his mouth and both his eyes  as he stepped backward from the
table  the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left 
dropped into a comfortable attitude  and stood surveying the guest while
he ate and drank  as from an observatory or watchtower  according to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages 

when mr  lorry had finished his breakfast  he went out for a stroll on
the beach  the little narrow  crooked town of dover hid itself away
from the beach  and ran its head into the chalk cliffs  like a marine
ostrich  the beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about  and the sea did what it liked  and what it liked was
destruction  it thundered at the town  and thundered at the cliffs  and
brought the coast down  madly  the air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it  as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea  a little
fishing was done in the port  and a quantity of strolling about by
night  and looking seaward  particularly at those times when the tide
made  and was near flood  small tradesmen  who did no business whatever 
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes  and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter 

as the day declined into the afternoon  and the air  which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the french coast to be seen  became
again charged with mist and vapour  mr  lorry   thoughts seemed to cloud
too  when it was dark  and he sat before the coffee room fire  awaiting
his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast  his mind was busily digging 
digging  digging  in the live red coals 

a bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm  otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work 
mr  lorry had been idle a long time  and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle  when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street  and rumbled into the inn yard 

he set down his glass untouched   this is mam selle   said he 

in a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that miss manette
had arrived from london  and would be happy to see the gentleman from
tellson   

 so soon  

miss manette had taken some refreshment on the road  and required none
then  and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from tellson  
immediately  if it suited his pleasure and convenience 

the gentleman from tellson   had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation  settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears  and follow the waiter to miss manette   apartment 
it was a large  dark room  furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair  and loaded with heavy dark tables  these had been oiled and
oiled  until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf  as if  they  were buried  in deep
graves of black mahogany  and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dug out 

the obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that mr  lorry  picking his
way over the well worn turkey carpet  supposed miss manette to be  for
the moment  in some adjacent room  until  having got past the two tall
candles  he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire  a young lady of not more than seventeen  in a riding cloak 
and still holding her straw travelling hat by its ribbon in her hand  as
his eyes rested on a short  slight  pretty figure  a quantity of golden
hair  a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look  and
a forehead with a singular capacity  remembering how young and smooth
it was   of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity  or wonder  or alarm  or merely of a bright
fixed attention  though it included all the four expressions  as his
eyes rested on these things  a sudden vivid likeness passed before him 
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
channel  one cold time  when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high  the likeness passed away  like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier glass behind her  on the frame of which  a hospital
procession of negro cupids  several headless and all cripples  were
offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender  and he made his formal bow to miss manette 

 pray take a seat  sir   in a very clear and pleasant young voice  a
little foreign in its accent  but a very little indeed 

 i kiss your hand  miss   said mr  lorry  with the manners of an earlier
date  as he made his formal bow again  and took his seat 

 i received a letter from the bank  sir  yesterday  informing me that
some intelligence  or discovery   

 the word is not material  miss  either word will do  

   respecting the small property of my poor father  whom i never saw  so
long dead   

mr  lorry moved in his chair  and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids  as if  they  had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets 

   rendered it necessary that i should go to paris  there to communicate
with a gentleman of the bank  so good as to be despatched to paris for
the purpose  

 myself  

 as i was prepared to hear  sir  

she curtseyed to him  young ladies made curtseys in those days   with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she  he made her another bow 

 i replied to the bank  sir  that as it was considered necessary  by
those who know  and who are so kind as to advise me  that i should go to
france  and that as i am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me  i should esteem it highly if i might be permitted to place myself 
during the journey  under that worthy gentleman   protection  the
gentleman had left london  but i think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here  

 i was happy   said mr  lorry   to be entrusted with the charge  i shall
be more happy to execute it  

 sir  i thank you indeed  i thank you very gratefully  it was told me
by the bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business  and that i must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature  i have done my best to prepare myself  and i naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are  

 naturally   said mr  lorry   yes  i   

after a pause  he added  again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears   it is very difficult to begin  

he did not begin  but  in his indecision  met her glance  the young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression  but it was pretty
and characteristic  besides being singular  and she raised her hand 
as if with an involuntary action she caught at  or stayed some passing
shadow 

 are you quite a stranger to me  sir  

 am i not   mr  lorry opened his hands  and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile 

between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose  the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be  the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing  he watched her as she mused  and the
moment she raised her eyes again  went on 

 in your adopted country  i presume  i cannot do better than address you
as a young english lady  miss manette  

 if you please  sir  

 miss manette  i am a man of business  i have a business charge to
acquit myself of  in your reception of it  don   heed me any more than
if i was a speaking machine  truly  i am not much else  i will  with
your leave  relate to you  miss  the story of one of our customers  

 story  

he seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated  when he added 
in a hurry   yes  customers  in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers  he was a french gentleman  a scientific
gentleman  a man of great acquirements  a doctor  

 not of beauvais  

 why  yes  of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the
gentleman was of beauvais  like monsieur manette  your father  the
gentleman was of repute in paris  i had the honour of knowing him there 
our relations were business relations  but confidential  i was at that
time in our french house  and had been  oh  twenty years  

 at that time  i may ask  at what time  sir  

 i speak  miss  of twenty years ago  he married  an english lady  and
i was one of the trustees  his affairs  like the affairs of many other
french gentlemen and french families  were entirely in tellson   hands 
in a similar way i am  or i have been  trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers  these are mere business relations  miss 
there is no friendship in them  no particular interest  nothing like
sentiment  i have passed from one to another  in the course of my
business life  just as i pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day  in short  i have no feelings  i am a mere
machine  to go on   

 but this is my father   story  sir  and i begin to think   the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him   that when i was
left an orphan through my mother   surviving my father only two years 
it was you who brought me to england  i am almost sure it was you  

mr  lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his  and he put it with some ceremony to his lips  he then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again  and  holding
the chair back with his left hand  and using his right by turns to rub
his chin  pull his wig at the ears  or point what he said  stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his 

 miss manette  it  was  i  and you will see how truly i spoke of myself
just now  in saying i had no feelings  and that all the relations i hold
with my fellow creatures are mere business relations  when you reflect
that i have never seen you since  no  you have been the ward of
tellson   house since  and i have been busy with the other business of
tellson   house since  feelings  i have no time for them  no chance
of them  i pass my whole life  miss  in turning an immense pecuniary
mangle  

after this odd description of his daily routine of employment  mr  lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands  which was most
unnecessary  for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before   and resumed his former attitude 

 so far  miss  as you have remarked   this is the story of your
regretted father  now comes the difference  if your father had not died
when he did  don   be frightened  how you start  

she did  indeed  start  and she caught his wrist with both her hands 

 pray   said mr  lorry  in a soothing tone  bringing his left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble   pray control your agitation  a matter of
business  as i was saying   

her look so discomposed him that he stopped  wandered  and began anew 

 as i was saying  if monsieur manette had not died  if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared  if he had been spirited away  if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place  though no art could
trace him  if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that i in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper  across the water there  for instance  the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time  if his wife had
implored the king  the queen  the court  the clergy  for any tidings of
him  and all quite in vain   then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman  the doctor of beauvais  

 i entreat you to tell me more  sir  

 i will  i am going to  you can bear it  

 i can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment  

 you speak collectedly  and you   are  collected  that   good    though
his manner was less satisfied than his words    a matter of business 
regard it as a matter of business  business that must be done  now
if this doctor   wife  though a lady of great courage and spirit 
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
born   

 the little child was a daughter  sir  

 a daughter  a a matter of business  don   be distressed  miss  if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born 
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of  by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead  no  don   kneel  in
heaven   name why should you kneel to me  

 for the truth  o dear  good  compassionate sir  for the truth  

 a  a matter of business  you confuse me  and how can i transact
business if i am confused  let us be clear headed  if you could kindly
mention now  for instance  what nine times ninepence are  or how many
shillings in twenty guineas  it would be so encouraging  i should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind  

without directly answering to this appeal  she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her  and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been  that she
communicated some reassurance to mr  jarvis lorry 

 that   right  that   right  courage  business  you have business before
you  useful business  miss manette  your mother took this course with
you  and when she died  i believe broken hearted  having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father  she left you  at two years old 
to grow to be blooming  beautiful  and happy  without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison  or wasted there through many lingering years  

as he said the words he looked down  with an admiring pity  on the
flowing golden hair  as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey 

 you know that your parents had no great possession  and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you  there has been no new
discovery  of money  or of any other property  but   

he felt his wrist held closer  and he stopped  the expression in the
forehead  which had so particularly attracted his notice  and which was
now immovable  had deepened into one of pain and horror 

 but he has been  been found  he is alive  greatly changed  it is too
probable  almost a wreck  it is possible  though we will hope the best 
still  alive  your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in paris  and we are going there  i  to identify him if i can  you  to
restore him to life  love  duty  rest  comfort  

a shiver ran through her frame  and from it through his  she said  in a
low  distinct  awe stricken voice  as if she were saying it in a dream 

 i am going to see his ghost  it will be his ghost  not him  

mr  lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm   there  there 
there  see now  see now  the best and the worst are known to you  now 
you are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman  and  with a fair
sea voyage  and a fair land journey  you will be soon at his dear side  

she repeated in the same tone  sunk to a whisper   i have been free  i
have been happy  yet his ghost has never haunted me  

 only one thing more   said mr  lorry  laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention   he has been found under
another name  his own  long forgotten or long concealed  it would be
worse than useless now to inquire which  worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked  or always designedly
held prisoner  it would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries 
because it would be dangerous  better not to mention the subject 
anywhere or in any way  and to remove him  for a while at all
events  out of france  even i  safe as an englishman  and even
tellson    important as they are to french credit  avoid all naming of
the matter  i carry about me  not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it  this is a secret service altogether  my credentials  entries 
and memoranda  are all comprehended in the one line   recalled to life  
which may mean anything  but what is the matter  she doesn   notice a
word  miss manette  

perfectly still and silent  and not even fallen back in her chair  she
sat under his hand  utterly insensible  with her eyes open and fixed
upon him  and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead  so close was her hold upon his arm  that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her  therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving 

a wild looking woman  whom even in his agitation  mr  lorry observed to
be all of a red colour  and to have red hair  and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight fitting fashion  and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a grenadier wooden measure  and good measure too 
or a great stilton cheese  came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants  and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady  by laying a brawny hand upon his chest  and sending him
flying back against the nearest wall 

  i really think this must be a man   was mr  lorry   breathless
reflection  simultaneously with his coming against the wall  

 why  look at you all   bawled this figure  addressing the inn servants 
 why don   you go and fetch things  instead of standing there staring
at me  i am not so much to look at  am i  why don   you go and fetch
things  i ll let you know  if you don   bring smelling salts  cold
water  and vinegar  quick  i will  

there was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives  and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa  and tended her with great skill and
gentleness  calling her  my precious   and  my bird   and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care 

 and you in brown   she said  indignantly turning to mr  lorry 
 couldn   you tell her what you had to tell her  without frightening her
to death  look at her  with her pretty pale face and her cold hands  do
you call  that  being a banker  

mr  lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer  that he could only look on  at a distance  with much feebler
sympathy and humility  while the strong woman  having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of  letting them know  something
not mentioned if they stayed there  staring  recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations  and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
upon her shoulder 

 i hope she will do well now   said mr  lorry 

 no thanks to you in brown  if she does  my darling pretty  

 i hope   said mr  lorry  after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility   that you accompany miss manette to france  

 a likely thing  too   replied the strong woman   if it was ever
intended that i should go across salt water  do you suppose providence
would have cast my lot in an island  

this being another question hard to answer  mr  jarvis lorry withdrew to
consider it 




   the wine shop


a large cask of wine had been dropped and broken  in the street  the
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart  the cask had tumbled
out with a run  the hoops had burst  and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine shop  shattered like a walnut shell 

all the people within reach had suspended their business  or their
idleness  to run to the spot and drink the wine  the rough  irregular
stones of the street  pointing every way  and designed  one might have
thought  expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them 
had dammed it into little pools  these were surrounded  each by its own
jostling group or crowd  according to its size  some men kneeled down 
made scoops of their two hands joined  and sipped  or tried to help
women  who bent over their shoulders  to sip  before the wine had all
run out between their fingers  others  men and women  dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware  or even with
handkerchiefs from women   heads  which were squeezed dry into infants 
mouths  others made small mud embankments  to stem the wine as it ran 
others  directed by lookers on up at high windows  darted here and
there  to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions  others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee dyed
pieces of the cask  licking  and even champing the moister wine rotted
fragments with eager relish  there was no drainage to carry off the
wine  and not only did it all get taken up  but so much mud got taken up
along with it  that there might have been a scavenger in the street 
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence 

a shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices  voices of men  women 
and children  resounded in the street while this wine game lasted  there
was little roughness in the sport  and much playfulness  there was a
special companionship in it  an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one  which led  especially among the
luckier or lighter hearted  to frolicsome embraces  drinking of healths 
shaking of hands  and even joining of hands and dancing  a dozen
together  when the wine was gone  and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron pattern by fingers  these
demonstrations ceased  as suddenly as they had broken out  the man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting  set it in
motion again  the women who had left on a door step the little pot of
hot ashes  at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes  or in those of her child  returned to it  men
with bare arms  matted locks  and cadaverous faces  who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars  moved away  to descend again  and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine 

the wine was red wine  and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of saint antoine  in paris  where it was spilled  it had
stained many hands  too  and many faces  and many naked feet  and many
wooden shoes  the hands of the man who sawed the wood  left red marks
on the billets  and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby  was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again 
those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask  had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth  and one tall joker so besmirched  his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it  scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine lees  blood 

the time was to come  when that wine too would be spilled on the
street stones  and when the stain of it would be red upon many there 

and now that the cloud settled on saint antoine  which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance  the darkness of it was
heavy  cold  dirt  sickness  ignorance  and want  were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence  nobles of great power all of them 
but  most especially the last  samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill  and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young  shivered at every corner 
passed in and out at every doorway  looked from every window  fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook  the mill which
had worked them down  was the mill that grinds young people old  the
children had ancient faces and grave voices  and upon them  and upon the
grown faces  and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh 
was the sigh  hunger  it was prevalent everywhere  hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses  in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines  hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper  hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off  hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys  and started up from the filthy street that had no offal 
among its refuse  of anything to eat  hunger was the inscription on the
baker   shelves  written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread  at the sausage shop  in every dead dog preparation that
was offered for sale  hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder  hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato  fried with some reluctant
drops of oil 

its abiding place was in all things fitted to it  a narrow winding
street  full of offence and stench  with other narrow winding streets
diverging  all peopled by rags and nightcaps  and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps  and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill  in the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay  depressed and
slinking though they were  eyes of fire were not wanting among them  nor
compressed lips  white with what they suppressed  nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows rope they mused about enduring  or
inflicting  the trade signs  and they were almost as many as the shops 
were  all  grim illustrations of want  the butcher and the porkman
painted up  only the leanest scrags of meat  the baker  the coarsest of
meagre loaves  the people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine shops 
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer  and were
gloweringly confidential together  nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition  save tools and weapons  but  the cutler   knives
and axes were sharp and bright  the smith   hammers were heavy  and the
gunmaker   stock was murderous  the crippling stones of the pavement 
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water  had no footways  but
broke off abruptly at the doors  the kennel  to make amends  ran down
the middle of the street  when it ran at all  which was only after heavy
rains  and then it ran  by many eccentric fits  into the houses  across
the streets  at wide intervals  one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley  at night  when the lamplighter had let these down  and lighted 
and hoisted them again  a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead  as if they were at sea  indeed they were at sea  and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest 

for  the time was to come  when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter  in their idleness and hunger  so
long  as to conceive the idea of improving on his method  and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys  to flare upon the darkness of their
condition  but  the time was not come yet  and every wind that blew over
france shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain  for the birds  fine of
song and feather  took no warning 

the wine shop was a corner shop  better than most others in its
appearance and degree  and the master of the wine shop had stood outside
it  in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches  looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine   it   not my affair   said he  with a final shrug
of the shoulders   the people from the market did it  let them bring
another  

there  his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke 
he called to him across the way 

 say  then  my gaspard  what do you do there  

the fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance  as is often
the way with his tribe  it missed its mark  and completely failed  as is
often the way with his tribe too 

 what now  are you a subject for the mad hospital   said the wine shop
keeper  crossing the road  and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud  picked up for the purpose  and smeared over it   why do you write
in the public streets  is there  tell me thou  is there no other place
to write such words in  

in his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand  perhaps accidentally 
perhaps not  upon the joker   heart  the joker rapped it with his
own  took a nimble spring upward  and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude  with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand  and held out  a joker of an extremely  not to say wolfishly
practical character  he looked  under those circumstances 

 put it on  put it on   said the other   call wine  wine  and finish
there   with that advice  he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker  
dress  such as it was  quite deliberately  as having dirtied the hand on
his account  and then recrossed the road and entered the wine shop 

this wine shop keeper was a bull necked  martial looking man of thirty 
and he should have been of a hot temperament  for  although it was a
bitter day  he wore no coat  but carried one slung over his shoulder 
his shirt sleeves were rolled up  too  and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows  neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply curling short dark hair  he was a dark man altogether  with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them  good humoured looking on
the whole  but implacable looking  too  evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose  a man not desirable to be met  rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side  for nothing would turn
the man 

madame defarge  his wife  sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in  madame defarge was a stout woman of about his own age  with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything  a large hand
heavily ringed  a steady face  strong features  and great composure of
manner  there was a character about madame defarge  from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided  madame defarge being
sensitive to cold  was wrapped in fur  and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head  though not to the concealment of her large
earrings  her knitting was before her  but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick  thus engaged  with her right elbow supported
by her left hand  madame defarge said nothing when her lord came in  but
coughed just one grain of cough  this  in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line  suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers  for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way 

the wine shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about  until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady  who were seated in
a corner  other company were there  two playing cards  two playing
dominoes  three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine  as he passed behind the counter  he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady   this is our man  

 what the devil do  you  do in that galley there   said monsieur defarge
to himself   i don   know you  

but  he feigned not to notice the two strangers  and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter 

 how goes it  jacques   said one of these three to monsieur defarge   is
all the spilt wine swallowed  

 every drop  jacques   answered monsieur defarge 

when this interchange of christian name was effected  madame defarge 
picking her teeth with her toothpick  coughed another grain of cough 
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line 

 it is not often   said the second of the three  addressing monsieur
defarge   that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine  or
of anything but black bread and death  is it not so  jacques  

 it is so  jacques   monsieur defarge returned 

at this second interchange of the christian name  madame defarge  still
using her toothpick with profound composure  coughed another grain of
cough  and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line 

the last of the three now said his say  as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips 

 ah  so much the worse  a bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths  and hard lives they live  jacques  am i
right  jacques  

 you are right  jacques   was the response of monsieur defarge 

this third interchange of the christian name was completed at the moment
when madame defarge put her toothpick by  kept her eyebrows up  and
slightly rustled in her seat 

 hold then  true   muttered her husband   gentlemen  my wife  

the three customers pulled off their hats to madame defarge  with three
flourishes  she acknowledged their homage by bending her head  and
giving them a quick look  then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine shop  took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit  and became absorbed in it 

 gentlemen   said her husband  who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her   good day  the chamber  furnished bachelor fashion  that you
wished to see  and were inquiring for when i stepped out  is on the
fifth floor  the doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here   pointing with his hand   near to the window of
my establishment  but  now that i remember  one of you has already been
there  and can show the way  gentlemen  adieu  

they paid for their wine  and left the place  the eyes of monsieur
defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner  and begged the favour of a word 

 willingly  sir   said monsieur defarge  and quietly stepped with him to
the door 

their conference was very short  but very decided  almost at the first
word  monsieur defarge started and became deeply attentive  it had
not lasted a minute  when he nodded and went out  the gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady  and they  too  went out  madame defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows  and saw nothing 

mr  jarvis lorry and miss manette  emerging from the wine shop thus 
joined monsieur defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before  it opened from a stinking little black courtyard 
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses  inhabited
by a great number of people  in the gloomy tile paved entry to the
gloomy tile paved staircase  monsieur defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master  and put her hand to his lips  it was
a gentle action  but not at all gently done  a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds  he had no good humour
in his face  nor any openness of aspect left  but had become a secret 
angry  dangerous man 

 it is very high  it is a little difficult  better to begin slowly  
thus  monsieur defarge  in a stern voice  to mr  lorry  as they began
ascending the stairs 

 is he alone   the latter whispered 

 alone  god help him  who should be with him   said the other  in the
same low voice 

 is he always alone  then  

 yes  

 of his own desire  

 of his own necessity  as he was  when i first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if i would take him  and  at my peril be
discreet  as he was then  so he is now  

 he is greatly changed  

 changed  

the keeper of the wine shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand 
and mutter a tremendous curse  no direct answer could have been half so
forcible  mr  lorry   spirits grew heavier and heavier  as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher 

such a staircase  with its accessories  in the older and more crowded
parts of paris  would be bad enough now  but  at that time  it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses  every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building  that is to say 
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase  left its own heap of refuse on its own landing  besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows  the uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered  would have polluted
the air  even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities  the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable  through such an atmosphere  by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison  the way lay  yielding to his own disturbance of mind  and to
his young companion   agitation  which became greater every instant  mr 
jarvis lorry twice stopped to rest  each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating  by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted  seemed to escape  and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in  through the rusted bars  tastes  rather than glimpses  were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood  and nothing within range  nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of notre dame  had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations 

at last  the top of the staircase was gained  and they stopped for the
third time  there was yet an upper staircase  of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions  to be ascended  before the garret story
was reached  the keeper of the wine shop  always going a little in
advance  and always going on the side which mr  lorry took  as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady  turned himself about
here  and  carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder  took out a key 

 the door is locked then  my friend   said mr  lorry  surprised 

 ay  yes   was the grim reply of monsieur defarge 

 you think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired  

 i think it necessary to turn the key   monsieur defarge whispered it
closer in his ear  and frowned heavily 

 why  

 why  because he has lived so long  locked up  that he would be
frightened  rave  tear himself to pieces  die  come to i know not what
harm  if his door was left open  

 is it possible   exclaimed mr  lorry 

 is it possible   repeated defarge  bitterly   yes  and a beautiful
world we live in  when it  is  possible  and when many other such things
are possible  and not only possible  but done  done  see you   under
that sky there  every day  long live the devil  let us go on  

this dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper  that not a word
of it had reached the young lady   ears  but  by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion  and her face expressed such deep anxiety 
and  above all  such dread and terror  that mr  lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance 

 courage  dear miss  courage  business  the worst will be over in a
moment  it is but passing the room door  and the worst is over  then 
all the good you bring to him  all the relief  all the happiness you
bring to him  begin  let our good friend here  assist you on that side 
that   well  friend defarge  come  now  business  business  

they went up slowly and softly  the staircase was short  and they were
soon at the top  there  as it had an abrupt turn in it  they came all at
once in sight of three men  whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door  and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged  through some chinks or holes in the wall  on hearing
footsteps close at hand  these three turned  and rose  and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine shop 

 i forgot them in the surprise of your visit   explained monsieur
defarge   leave us  good boys  we have business here  

the three glided by  and went silently down 

there appearing to be no other door on that floor  and the keeper of
the wine shop going straight to this one when they were left alone  mr 
lorry asked him in a whisper  with a little anger 

 do you make a show of monsieur manette  

 i show him  in the way you have seen  to a chosen few  

 is that well  

  i  think it is well  

 who are the few  how do you choose them  

 i choose them as real men  of my name  jacques is my name  to whom the
sight is likely to do good  enough  you are english  that is another
thing  stay there  if you please  a little moment  

with an admonitory gesture to keep them back  he stooped  and looked in
through the crevice in the wall  soon raising his head again  he struck
twice or thrice upon the door  evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there  with the same intention  he drew the key across it 
three or four times  before he put it clumsily into the lock  and turned
it as heavily as he could 

the door slowly opened inward under his hand  and he looked into the
room and said something  a faint voice answered something  little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side 

he looked back over his shoulder  and beckoned them to enter  mr  lorry
got his arm securely round the daughter   waist  and held her  for he
felt that she was sinking 

 a a a business  business   he urged  with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek   come in  come in  

 i am afraid of it   she answered  shuddering 

 of it  what  

 i mean of him  of my father  

rendered in a manner desperate  by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor  he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder  lifted her a little  and hurried her into the room  he sat her
down just within the door  and held her  clinging to him 

defarge drew out the key  closed the door  locked it on the inside 
took out the key again  and held it in his hand  all this he did 
methodically  and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make  finally  he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was  he stopped there  and faced round 

the garret  built to be a depository for firewood and the like  was dim
and dark  for  the window of dormer shape  was in truth a door in the
roof  with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street  unglazed  and closing up the middle in two pieces  like any
other door of french construction  to exclude the cold  one half of this
door was fast closed  and the other was opened but a very little way 
such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means  that it
was difficult  on first coming in  to see anything  and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one  the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity  yet  work of that kind was being
done in the garret  for  with his back towards the door  and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine shop stood looking at
him  a white haired man sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very
busy  making shoes 




vi  the shoemaker


 good day   said monsieur defarge  looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking 

it was raised for a moment  and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation  as if it were at a distance 

 good day  

 you are still hard at work  i see  

after a long silence  the head was lifted for another moment  and the
voice replied   yes  i am working   this time  a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner  before the face had dropped again 

the faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful  it was not the
faintness of physical weakness  though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it  its deplorable peculiarity was  that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse  it was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago  so entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice  that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain  so sunken and
suppressed it was  that it was like a voice underground  so expressive
it was  of a hopeless and lost creature  that a famished traveller 
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness  would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die 

some minutes of silent work had passed  and the haggard eyes had looked
up again  not with any interest or curiosity  but with a dull mechanical
perception  beforehand  that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood  was not yet empty 

 i want   said defarge  who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker 
 to let in a little more light here  you can bear a little more  

the shoemaker stopped his work  looked with a vacant air of listening 
at the floor on one side of him  then similarly  at the floor on the
other side of him  then  upward at the speaker 

 what did you say  

 you can bear a little more light  

 i must bear it  if you let it in    laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word  

the opened half door was opened a little further  and secured at that
angle for the time  a broad ray of light fell into the garret  and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap  pausing in his
labour  his few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench  he had a white beard  raggedly cut  but not very
long  a hollow face  and exceedingly bright eyes  the hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large  under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair  though they had been really
otherwise  but  they were naturally large  and looked unnaturally so 
his yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat  and showed his body
to be withered and worn  he  and his old canvas frock  and his loose
stockings  and all his poor tatters of clothes  had  in a long seclusion
from direct light and air  faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment yellow  that it would have been hard to say which was which 

he had put up a hand between his eyes and the light  and the very bones
of it seemed transparent  so he sat  with a steadfastly vacant gaze 
pausing in his work  he never looked at the figure before him  without
first looking down on this side of himself  then on that  as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound  he never spoke  without
first wandering in this manner  and forgetting to speak 

 are you going to finish that pair of shoes to day   asked defarge 
motioning to mr  lorry to come forward 

 what did you say  

 do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to day  

 i can   say that i mean to  i suppose so  i don   know  

but  the question reminded him of his work  and he bent over it again 

mr  lorry came silently forward  leaving the daughter by the door  when
he had stood  for a minute or two  by the side of defarge  the shoemaker
looked up  he showed no surprise at seeing another figure  but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it  his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead colour   and then
the hand dropped to his work  and he once more bent over the shoe  the
look and the action had occupied but an instant 

 you have a visitor  you see   said monsieur defarge 

 what did you say  

 here is a visitor  

the shoemaker looked up as before  but without removing a hand from his
work 

 come   said defarge   here is monsieur  who knows a well made shoe when
he sees one  show him that shoe you are working at  take it  monsieur  

mr  lorry took it in his hand 

 tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is  and the maker   name  

there was a longer pause than usual  before the shoemaker replied 

 i forget what it was you asked me  what did you say  

 i said  couldn   you describe the kind of shoe  for monsieur  
information  

 it is a lady   shoe  it is a young lady   walking shoe  it is in the
present mode  i never saw the mode  i have had a pattern in my hand   he
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride 

 and the maker   name   said defarge 

now that he had no work to hold  he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left  and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right  and then passed a hand across his bearded chin  and
so on in regular changes  without a moment   intermission  the task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken  was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon  or
endeavouring  in the hope of some disclosure  to stay the spirit of a
fast dying man 

 did you ask me for my name  

 assuredly i did  

 one hundred and five  north tower  

 is that all  

 one hundred and five  north tower  

with a weary sound that was not a sigh  nor a groan  he bent to work
again  until the silence was again broken 

 you are not a shoemaker by trade   said mr  lorry  looking steadfastly
at him 

his haggard eyes turned to defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him  but as no help came from that quarter  they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground 

 i am not a shoemaker by trade  no  i was not a shoemaker by trade  i i
learnt it here  i taught myself  i asked leave to   

he lapsed away  even for minutes  ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time  his eyes came slowly back  at last  to the face
from which they had wandered  when they rested on it  he started  and
resumed  in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake  reverting to a
subject of last night 

 i asked leave to teach myself  and i got it with much difficulty after
a long while  and i have made shoes ever since  

as he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him  mr 
lorry said  still looking steadfastly in his face 

 monsieur manette  do you remember nothing of me  

the shoe dropped to the ground  and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner 

 monsieur manette   mr  lorry laid his hand upon defarge   arm   do you
remember nothing of this man  look at him  look at me  is there no old
banker  no old business  no old servant  no old time  rising in your
mind  monsieur manette  

as the captive of many years sat looking fixedly  by turns  at mr 
lorry and at defarge  some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead  gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him  they were overclouded
again  they were fainter  they were gone  but they had been there  and
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him  and where
she now stood looking at him  with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion  if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him  but which were now extending towards him 
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast  and love it back to life and hope  so exactly was the expression
repeated  though in stronger characters  on her fair young face  that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light  from him to her 

darkness had fallen on him in its place  he looked at the two  less and
less attentively  and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way  finally  with a deep long sigh  he
took the shoe up  and resumed his work 

 have you recognised him  monsieur   asked defarge in a whisper 

 yes  for a moment  at first i thought it quite hopeless  but i have
unquestionably seen  for a single moment  the face that i once knew so
well  hush  let us draw further back  hush  

she had moved from the wall of the garret  very near to the bench on
which he sat  there was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour 

not a word was spoken  not a sound was made  she stood  like a spirit 
beside him  and he bent over his work 

it happened  at length  that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand  for his shoemaker   knife  it lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood  he had taken it up  and was
stooping to work again  when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress  he
raised them  and saw her face  the two spectators started forward 
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand  she had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife  though they had 

he stared at her with a fearful look  and after a while his lips began
to form some words  though no sound proceeded from them  by degrees  in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing  he was heard to say 

 what is this  

with the tears streaming down her face  she put her two hands to her
lips  and kissed them to him  then clasped them on her breast  as if she
laid his ruined head there 

 you are not the gaoler   daughter  

she sighed  no  

 who are you  

not yet trusting the tones of her voice  she sat down on the bench
beside him  he recoiled  but she laid her hand upon his arm  a strange
thrill struck him when she did so  and visibly passed over his frame  he
laid the knife down softly  as he sat staring at her 

her golden hair  which she wore in long curls  had been hurriedly pushed
aside  and fell down over her neck  advancing his hand by little and
little  he took it up and looked at it  in the midst of the action
he went astray  and  with another deep sigh  fell to work at his
shoemaking 

but not for long  releasing his arm  she laid her hand upon his
shoulder  after looking doubtfully at it  two or three times  as if to
be sure that it was really there  he laid down his work  put his hand
to his neck  and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it  he opened this  carefully  on his knee  and it contained
a very little quantity of hair  not more than one or two long golden
hairs  which he had  in some old day  wound off upon his finger 

he took her hair into his hand again  and looked closely at it   it is
the same  how can it be  when was it  how was it  

as the concentrated expression returned to his forehead  he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too  he turned her full to the
light  and looked at her 

 she had laid her head upon my shoulder  that night when i was summoned
out  she had a fear of my going  though i had none  and when i was
brought to the north tower they found these upon my sleeve   you will
leave me them  they can never help me to escape in the body  though they
may in the spirit   those were the words i said  i remember them very
well  

he formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it 
but when he did find spoken words for it  they came to him coherently 
though slowly 

 how was this    was it you   

once more  the two spectators started  as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness  but she sat perfectly still in his grasp  and only
said  in a low voice   i entreat you  good gentlemen  do not come near
us  do not speak  do not move  

 hark   he exclaimed   whose voice was that  

his hands released her as he uttered this cry  and went up to his white
hair  which they tore in a frenzy  it died out  as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him  and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast  but he still looked at her  and
gloomily shook his head 

 no  no  no  you are too young  too blooming  it can   be  see what the
prisoner is  these are not the hands she knew  this is not the face
she knew  this is not a voice she ever heard  no  no  she was  and he
was  before the slow years of the north tower  ages ago  what is your
name  my gentle angel  

hailing his softened tone and manner  his daughter fell upon her knees
before him  with her appealing hands upon his breast 

 o  sir  at another time you shall know my name  and who my mother was 
and who my father  and how i never knew their hard  hard history  but i
cannot tell you at this time  and i cannot tell you here  all that i may
tell you  here and now  is  that i pray to you to touch me and to bless
me  kiss me  kiss me  o my dear  my dear  

his cold white head mingled with her radiant hair  which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of freedom shining on him 

 if you hear in my voice  i don   know that it is so  but i hope it
is  if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears  weep for it  weep for it  if you touch  in
touching my hair  anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free  weep for it  weep for it  if  when
i hint to you of a home that is before us  where i will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service  i bring back the
remembrance of a home long desolate  while your poor heart pined away 
weep for it  weep for it  

she held him closer round the neck  and rocked him on her breast like a
child 

 if  when i tell you  dearest dear  that your agony is over  and that i
have come here to take you from it  and that we go to england to be at
peace and at rest  i cause you to think of your useful life laid waste 
and of our native france so wicked to you  weep for it  weep for it  and
if  when i shall tell you of my name  and of my father who is living 
and of my mother who is dead  you learn that i have to kneel to my
honoured father  and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night  because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me  weep for it  weep for it  weep
for her  then  and for me  good gentlemen  thank god  i feel his sacred
tears upon my face  and his sobs strike against my heart  o  see  thank
god for us  thank god  

he had sunk in her arms  and his face dropped on her breast  a sight so
touching  yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it  that the two beholders covered their faces 

when the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed  and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms  emblem to humanity  of the rest and silence into which the storm
called life must hush at last  they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground  he had gradually dropped to the floor  and lay
there in a lethargy  worn out  she had nestled down with him  that his
head might lie upon her arm  and her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light 

 if  without disturbing him   she said  raising her hand to mr  lorry as
he stooped over them  after repeated blowings of his nose   all could be
arranged for our leaving paris at once  so that  from the very door  he
could be taken away   

 but  consider  is he fit for the journey   asked mr  lorry 

 more fit for that  i think  than to remain in this city  so dreadful to
him  

 it is true   said defarge  who was kneeling to look on and hear   more
than that  monsieur manette is  for all reasons  best out of france 
say  shall i hire a carriage and post horses  

 that   business   said mr  lorry  resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners   and if business is to be done  i had better do it  

 then be so kind   urged miss manette   as to leave us here  you see how
composed he has become  and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
now  why should you be  if you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption  i do not doubt that you will find him  when you come back 
as quiet as you leave him  in any case  i will take care of him until
you return  and then we will remove him straight  

both mr  lorry and defarge were rather disinclined to this course  and
in favour of one of them remaining  but  as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to  but travelling papers  and as time pressed 
for the day was drawing to an end  it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done  and hurrying away
to do it 

then  as the darkness closed in  the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the father   side  and watched him  the darkness
deepened and deepened  and they both lay quiet  until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall 

mr  lorry and monsieur defarge had made all ready for the journey  and
had brought with them  besides travelling cloaks and wrappers  bread and
meat  wine  and hot coffee  monsieur defarge put this provender  and the
lamp he carried  on the shoemaker   bench  there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed   and he and mr  lorry roused the captive  and
assisted him to his feet 

no human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind  in
the scared blank wonder of his face  whether he knew what had happened 
whether he recollected what they had said to him  whether he knew that
he was free  were questions which no sagacity could have solved  they
tried speaking to him  but  he was so confused  and so very slow to
answer  that they took fright at his bewilderment  and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more  he had a wild  lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands  that had not been seen
in him before  yet  he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter   voice  and invariably turned to it when she spoke 

in the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion  he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink  and put on the cloak
and other wrappings  that they gave him to wear  he readily responded to
his daughter   drawing her arm through his  and took  and kept  her hand
in both his own 

they began to descend  monsieur defarge going first with the lamp  mr 
lorry closing the little procession  they had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped  and stared at the roof and
round at the walls 

 you remember the place  my father  you remember coming up here  

 what did you say  

but  before she could repeat the question  he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it 

 remember  no  i don   remember  it was so very long ago  

that he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house  was apparent to them  they heard him mutter 
 one hundred and five  north tower   and when he looked about him  it
evidently was for the strong fortress walls which had long encompassed
him  on their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread  as being in expectation of a drawbridge  and when there was
no drawbridge  and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street  he
dropped his daughter   hand and clasped his head again 

no crowd was about the door  no people were discernible at any of the
many windows  not even a chance passerby was in the street  an unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there  only one soul was to be seen  and
that was madame defarge  who leaned against the door post  knitting  and
saw nothing 

the prisoner had got into a coach  and his daughter had followed
him  when mr  lorry   feet were arrested on the step by his asking 
miserably  for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes  madame
defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them  and
went  knitting  out of the lamplight  through the courtyard  she quickly
brought them down and handed them in   and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door post  knitting  and saw nothing 

defarge got upon the box  and gave the word  to the barrier   the
postilion cracked his whip  and they clattered away under the feeble
over swinging lamps 

under the over swinging lamps  swinging ever brighter in the better
streets  and ever dimmer in the worse  and by lighted shops  gay crowds 
illuminated coffee houses  and theatre doors  to one of the city
gates  soldiers with lanterns  at the guard house there   your papers 
travellers    see here then  monsieur the officer   said defarge 
getting down  and taking him gravely apart   these are the papers of
monsieur inside  with the white head  they were consigned to me  with
him  at the    he dropped his voice  there was a flutter among the
military lanterns  and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform  the eyes connected with the arm looked  not an every day
or an every night look  at monsieur with the white head   it is well 
forward   from the uniform   adieu   from defarge  and so  under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over swinging lamps  out under the great
grove of stars 

beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights  some  so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it  as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done  the shadows of the night were broad and black 
all through the cold and restless interval  until dawn  they once more
whispered in the ears of mr  jarvis lorry  sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out  and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him  and what were capable of restoration  the old inquiry 

 i hope you care to be recalled to life  

and the old answer 

 i can   say  


the end of the first book 





book the second  the golden thread




i  five years later


tellson   bank by temple bar was an old fashioned place  even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty  it was very small  very
dark  very ugly  very incommodious  it was an old fashioned place 
moreover  in the moral attribute that the partners in the house were
proud of its smallness  proud of its darkness  proud of its ugliness 
proud of its incommodiousness  they were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars  and were fired by an express conviction that  if
it were less objectionable  it would be less respectable  this was
no passive belief  but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business  tellson    they said  wanted
no elbow room  tellson   wanted no light  tellson   wanted no
embellishment  noakes and co    might  or snooks brothers  might  but
tellson    thank heaven   

any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding tellson    in this respect the house was much
on a par with the country  which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable  but were only the more respectable 

thus it had come to pass  that tellson   was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience  after bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat  you fell into tellson   down two steps 
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop  with two little
counters  where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it  while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows  which were always under a shower bath of mud from fleet street 
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper  and the
heavy shadow of temple bar  if your business necessitated your seeing
 the house   you were put into a species of condemned hold at the back 
where you meditated on a misspent life  until the house came with its
hands in its pockets  and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight  your money came out of  or went into  wormy old wooden
drawers  particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut  your bank notes had a musty odour  as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again  your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools  and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two  your deeds got into extemporised strong rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries  and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking house air  your lighter boxes of family
papers went up stairs into a barmecide room  that always had a great
dining table in it and never had a dinner  and where  even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty  the first letters written to you
by your old love  or by your little children  were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows  by the heads
exposed on temple bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
abyssinia or ashantee 

but indeed  at that time  putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions  and not least of all with tellson   
death is nature   remedy for all things  and why not legislation   
accordingly  the forger was put to death  the utterer of a bad note
was put to death  the unlawful opener of a letter was put to death  the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to death  the holder
of a horse at tellson   door  who made off with it  was put to
death  the coiner of a bad shilling was put to death  the sounders of
three fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of crime  were put to
death  not that it did the least good in the way of prevention  it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse  but  it cleared off  as to this world  the trouble of each
particular case  and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after  thus  tellson    in its day  like greater places of business 
its contemporaries  had taken so many lives  that  if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on temple bar instead of being privately
disposed of  they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had  in a rather significant manner 

cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at tellson    the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely  when they took a young
man into tellson   london house  they hid him somewhere till he was
old  they kept him in a dark place  like a cheese  until he had the full
tellson flavour and blue mould upon him  then only was he permitted to
be seen  spectacularly poring over large books  and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment 

outside tellson    never by any means in it  unless called in  was an
odd job man  an occasional porter and messenger  who served as the live
sign of the house  he was never absent during business hours  unless
upon an errand  and then he was represented by his son  a grisly urchin
of twelve  who was his express image  people understood that tellson   
in a stately way  tolerated the odd job man  the house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity  and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post  his surname was cruncher  and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness  in the
easterly parish church of hounsditch  he had received the added
appellation of jerry 

the scene was mr  cruncher   private lodging in hanging sword alley 
whitefriars  the time  half past seven of the clock on a windy march
morning  anno domini seventeen hundred and eighty   mr  cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our lord as anna dominoes  apparently under
the impression that the christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game  by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it  

mr  cruncher   apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood  and were
but two in number  even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one  but they were very decently kept  early as
it was  on the windy march morning  the room in which he lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout  and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast  and the lumbering deal table  a very clean white cloth
was spread 

mr  cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane  like a harlequin
at home  at first  he slept heavily  but  by degrees  began to roll
and surge in bed  until he rose above the surface  with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons  at which juncture  he
exclaimed  in a voice of dire exasperation 

 bust me  if she ain   at it agin  

a woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner  with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
person referred to 

 what   said mr  cruncher  looking out of bed for a boot   you re at it
agin  are you  

after hailing the morn with this second salutation  he threw a boot at
the woman as a third  it was a very muddy boot  and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with mr  cruncher   domestic economy  that 
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots  he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay 

 what   said mr  cruncher  varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark   what are you up to  aggerawayter  

 i was only saying my prayers  

 saying your prayers  you re a nice woman  what do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying agin me  

 i was not praying against you  i was praying for you  

 you weren    and if you were  i won   be took the liberty with  here 
your mother   a nice woman  young jerry  going a praying agin your
father   prosperity  you ve got a dutiful mother  you have  my son 
you ve got a religious mother  you have  my boy  going and flopping
herself down  and praying that the bread and butter may be snatched out
of the mouth of her only child  

master cruncher  who was in his shirt  took this very ill  and  turning
to his mother  strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board 

 and what do you suppose  you conceited female   said mr  cruncher  with
unconscious inconsistency   that the worth of  your  prayers may be 
name the price that you put  your  prayers at  

 they only come from the heart  jerry  they are worth no more than
that  

 worth no more than that   repeated mr  cruncher   they ain   worth
much  then  whether or no  i won   be prayed agin  i tell you  i can  
afford it  i   not a going to be made unlucky by  your  sneaking  if
you must go flopping yourself down  flop in favour of your husband and
child  and not in opposition to  em  if i had had any but a unnat ral
wife  and this poor boy had had any but a unnat ral mother  i might
have made some money last week instead of being counter prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck 
      ust me   said mr  cruncher  who all this time had been putting
on his clothes   if i ain    what with piety and one blowed thing and
another  been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with  young jerry  dress yourself  my
boy  and while i clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then  and if you see any signs of more flopping  give me a call  for  i
tell you   here he addressed his wife once more   i won   be gone agin 
in this manner  i am as rickety as a hackney coach  i   as sleepy as
laudanum  my lines is strained to that degree that i shouldn   know  if
it wasn   for the pain in  em  which was me and which somebody else  yet
i   none the better for it in pocket  and it   my suspicion that you ve
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket  and i won   put up with it  aggerawayter  and what do you
say now  

growling  in addition  such phrases as  ah  yes  you re religious  too 
you wouldn   put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child  would you  not you   and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation  mr  cruncher betook
himself to his boot cleaning and his general preparation for business 
in the meantime  his son  whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes 
and whose young eyes stood close by one another  as his father   did 
kept the required watch upon his mother  he greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals  by darting out of his sleeping closet  where he made
his toilet  with a suppressed cry of  you are going to flop  mother 
  halloa  father   and  after raising this fictitious alarm  darting in
again with an undutiful grin 

mr  cruncher   temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast  he resented mrs  cruncher   saying grace with particular
animosity 

 now  aggerawayter  what are you up to  at it again  

his wife explained that she had merely  asked a blessing  

 don   do it   said mr  crunches looking about  as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife   petitions   i
ain   a going to be blest out of house and home  i won   have my wittles
blest off my table  keep still  

exceedingly red eyed and grim  as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn  jerry cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it  growling over it like any four footed
inmate of a menagerie  towards nine o clock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect  and  presenting as respectable and business like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with  issued forth to the occupation
of the day 

it could scarcely be called a trade  in spite of his favourite
description of himself as  a honest tradesman   his stock consisted of
a wooden stool  made out of a broken backed chair cut down  which stool 
young jerry  walking at his father   side  carried every morning to
beneath the banking house window that was nearest temple bar  where 
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd job man  
feet  it formed the encampment for the day  on this post of his  mr 
cruncher was as well known to fleet street and the temple  as the bar
itself   and was almost as in looking 

encamped at a quarter before nine  in good time to touch his
three cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to tellson   
jerry took up his station on this windy march morning  with young jerry
standing by him  when not engaged in making forays through the bar  to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose  father and son 
extremely like each other  looking silently on at the morning traffic
in fleet street  with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were  bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys 
the resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance  that
the mature jerry bit and spat out straw  while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
in fleet street 

the head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to tellson  
establishment was put through the door  and the word was given 

 porter wanted  

 hooray  father  here   an early job to begin with  

having thus given his parent god speed  young jerry seated himself on
the stool  entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing  and cogitated 

 al ways rusty  his fingers is al ways rusty   muttered young jerry 
 where does my father get all that iron rust from  he don   get no iron
rust here  




ii  a sight


 you know the old bailey well  no doubt   said one of the oldest of
clerks to jerry the messenger 

 ye es  sir   returned jerry  in something of a dogged manner   i  do 
know the bailey  

 just so  and you know mr  lorry  

 i know mr  lorry  sir  much better than i know the bailey  much
better   said jerry  not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question   than i  as a honest tradesman  wish to know the bailey  

 very well  find the door where the witnesses go in  and show the
door keeper this note for mr  lorry  he will then let you in  

 into the court  sir  

 into the court  

mr  cruncher   eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another  and to
interchange the inquiry   what do you think of this  

 am i to wait in the court  sir   he asked  as the result of that
conference 

 i am going to tell you  the door keeper will pass the note to mr 
lorry  and do you make any gesture that will attract mr  lorry  
attention  and show him where you stand  then what you have to do  is 
to remain there until he wants you  

 is that all  sir  

 that   all  he wishes to have a messenger at hand  this is to tell him
you are there  

as the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note 
mr  cruncher  after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting paper stage  remarked 

 i suppose they ll be trying forgeries this morning  

 treason  

 that   quartering   said jerry   barbarous  

 it is the law   remarked the ancient clerk  turning his surprised
spectacles upon him   it is the law  

 it   hard in the law to spile a man  i think  it   hard enough to kill
him  but it   wery hard to spile him  sir  

 not at all   retained the ancient clerk   speak well of the law  take
care of your chest and voice  my good friend  and leave the law to take
care of itself  i give you that advice  

 it   the damp  sir  what settles on my chest and voice   said jerry   i
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is  

 well  well   said the old clerk   we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood  some of us have damp ways  and some of us have dry
ways  here is the letter  go along  

jerry took the letter  and  remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of   you are a lean old one 
too   made his bow  informed his son  in passing  of his destination 
and went his way 

they hanged at tyburn  in those days  so the street outside newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it 
but  the gaol was a vile place  in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised  and where dire diseases were bred  that came
into court with the prisoners  and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my lord chief justice himself  and pulled him off the bench  it
had more than once happened  that the judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoner    and even died before him 
for the rest  the old bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn yard 
from which pale travellers set out continually  in carts and coaches  on
a violent passage into the other world  traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road  and shaming few good citizens  if any 
so powerful is use  and so desirable to be good use in the beginning  it
was famous  too  for the pillory  a wise old institution  that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent  also  for
the whipping post  another dear old institution  very humanising and
softening to behold in action  also  for extensive transactions in
blood money  another fragment of ancestral wisdom  systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under heaven  altogether  the old bailey  at that date  was a choice
illustration of the precept  that  whatever is is right   an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy  did it not include the troublesome
consequence  that nothing that ever was  was wrong 

making his way through the tainted crowd  dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action  with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly  the messenger found out the door he sought  and handed in
his letter through a trap in it  for  people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey  just as they paid to see the play in bedlam  only the
former entertainment was much the dearer  therefore  all the old bailey
doors were well guarded  except  indeed  the social doors by which the
criminals got there  and those were always left wide open 

after some delay and demur  the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way  and allowed mr  jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into
court 

 what   on   he asked  in a whisper  of the man he found himself next
to 

 nothing yet  

 what   coming on  

 the treason case  

 the quartering one  eh  

 ah   returned the man  with a relish   he ll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged  and then he ll be taken down and sliced before his own
face  and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on 
and then his head will be chopped off  and he ll be cut into quarters 
that   the sentence  

 if he   found guilty  you mean to say   jerry added  by way of proviso 

 oh  they ll find him guilty   said the other   don   you be afraid of
that  

mr  cruncher   attention was here diverted to the door keeper  whom he
saw making his way to mr  lorry  with the note in his hand  mr  lorry
sat at a table  among the gentlemen in wigs  not far from a wigged
gentleman  the prisoner   counsel  who had a great bundle of papers
before him  and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets  whose whole attention  when mr  cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards  seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court  after some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand  jerry attracted the notice of mr  lorry  who had stood up
to look for him  and who quietly nodded and sat down again 

 what    he  got to do with the case   asked the man he had spoken with 

 blest if i know   said jerry 

 what have  you  got to do with it  then  if a person may inquire  

 blest if i know that either   said jerry 

the entrance of the judge  and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court  stopped the dialogue  presently  the dock became the
central point of interest  two gaolers  who had been standing there 
went out  and the prisoner was brought in  and put to the bar 

everybody present  except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling  stared at him  all the human breath in the place  rolled
at him  like a sea  or a wind  or a fire  eager faces strained round
pillars and corners  to get a sight of him  spectators in back rows
stood up  not to miss a hair of him  people on the floor of the court 
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them  to help
themselves  at anybody   cost  to a view of him  stood a tiptoe  got
upon ledges  stood upon next to nothing  to see every inch of him 
conspicuous among these latter  like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of newgate  jerry stood  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along  and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer  and gin  and tea  and coffee  and what not 
that flowed at him  and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain 

the object of all this staring and blaring  was a young man of about
five and twenty  well grown and well looking  with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye  his condition was that of a young gentleman  he was plainly
dressed in black  or very dark grey  and his hair  which was long and
dark  was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck  more to be out
of his way than for ornament  as an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body  so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek  showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun  he was otherwise quite self possessed 
bowed to the judge  and stood quiet 

the sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at 
was not a sort that elevated humanity  had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence  had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared  by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination  the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled 
was the sight  the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder  yielded the sensation  whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest  according to their several arts and
powers of self deceit  the interest was  at the root of it  ogreish 

silence in the court  charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to
an indictment denouncing him  with infinite jingle and jangle  for that
he was a false traitor to our serene  illustrious  excellent  and so
forth  prince  our lord the king  by reason of his having  on divers
occasions  and by divers means and ways  assisted lewis  the french
king  in his wars against our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and
so forth  that was to say  by coming and going  between the dominions of
our said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  and those of the
said french lewis  and wickedly  falsely  traitorously  and otherwise
evil adverbiously  revealing to the said french lewis what forces our
said serene  illustrious  excellent  and so forth  had in preparation
to send to canada and north america  this much  jerry  with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it  made out with
huge satisfaction  and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid  and over and over again aforesaid  charles darnay  stood
there before him upon his trial  that the jury were swearing in  and
that mr  attorney general was making ready to speak 

the accused  who was  and who knew he was  being mentally hanged 
beheaded  and quartered  by everybody there  neither flinched from
the situation  nor assumed any theatrical air in it  he was quiet and
attentive  watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest 
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him  so
composedly  that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn  the court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar  as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever 

over the prisoner   head there was a mirror  to throw the light down
upon him  crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it  and had passed from its surface and this earth   together  haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been  if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections  as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead  some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved  may have struck the prisoner   mind  be
that as it may  a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face  he looked up  and when he saw the glass his
face flushed  and his right hand pushed the herbs away 

it happened  that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left  about on a level with his eyes  there sat 
in that corner of the judge   bench  two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested  so immediately  and so much to the changing of his
aspect  that all the eyes that were turned upon him  turned to them 

the spectators saw in the two figures  a young lady of little more than
twenty  and a gentleman who was evidently her father  a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair 
and a certain indescribable intensity of face  not of an active kind 
but pondering and self communing  when this expression was upon him  he
looked as if he were old  but when it was stirred and broken up  as
it was now  in a moment  on his speaking to his daughter  he became a
handsome man  not past the prime of life 

his daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm  as she sat by
him  and the other pressed upon it  she had drawn close to him  in her
dread of the scene  and in her pity for the prisoner  her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused  this had been so very
noticeable  so very powerfully and naturally shown  that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her  and the whisper went about 
 who are they  

jerry  the messenger  who had made his own observations  in his own
manner  and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption  stretched his neck to hear who they were  the crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant  and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back  at last it got
to jerry 

 witnesses  

 for which side  

 against  

 against what side  

 the prisoner    

the judge  whose eyes had gone in the general direction  recalled them 
leaned back in his seat  and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand  as mr  attorney general rose to spin the rope  grind the
axe  and hammer the nails into the scaffold 




iii  a disappointment


mr  attorney general had to inform the jury  that the prisoner before
them  though young in years  was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life  that this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to day  or of yesterday  or
even of last year  or of the year before  that  it was certain the
prisoner had  for longer than that  been in the habit of passing and
repassing between france and england  on secret business of which
he could give no honest account  that  if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive  which happily it never was   the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered 
that providence  however  had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach  to ferret out the nature of the
prisoner   schemes  and  struck with horror  to disclose them to his
majesty   chief secretary of state and most honourable privy council 
that  this patriot would be produced before them  that  his position and
attitude were  on the whole  sublime  that  he had been the prisoner  
friend  but  at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy  had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom  on the sacred altar of his country  that  if statues
were decreed in britain  as in ancient greece and rome  to public
benefactors  this shining citizen would assuredly have had one  that  as
they were not so decreed  he probably would not have one  that  virtue 
as had been observed by the poets  in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have  word for word  at the tips of their tongues 
whereat the jury   countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages   was in a manner contagious  more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism  or love of country 
that  the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the crown  to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour  had
communicated itself to the prisoner   servant  and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his master   table drawers and pockets 
and secrete his papers  that  he  mr  attorney general  was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant  but that 
in a general way  he preferred him to his  mr  attorney general   
brothers and sisters  and honoured him more than his  mr 
attorney general    father and mother  that  he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise  that  the evidence of these two
witnesses  coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced  would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his majesty   forces  and of their disposition and preparation  both by
sea and land  and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power  that  these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoner   handwriting  but that it was all the
same  that  indeed  it was rather the better for the prosecution  as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions  that  the proof
would go back five years  and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions  within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the british troops and the americans 
that  for these reasons  the jury  being a loyal jury  as he knew they
were   and being a responsible jury  as  they  knew they were   must
positively find the prisoner guilty  and make an end of him  whether
they liked it or not  that  they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows  that  they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows  that  they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows  in short  that
there never more could be  for them or theirs  any laying of heads upon
pillows at all  unless the prisoner   head was taken off  that head
mr  attorney general concluded by demanding of them  in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it  and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone 

when the attorney general ceased  a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue flies were swarming about the prisoner  in
anticipation of what he was soon to become  when toned down again  the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness box 

mr  solicitor general then  following his leader   lead  examined the
patriot  john barsad  gentleman  by name  the story of his pure soul was
exactly what mr  attorney general had described it to be  perhaps  if
it had a fault  a little too exactly  having released his noble bosom
of its burden  he would have modestly withdrawn himself  but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him  sitting not far from mr 
lorry  begged to ask him a few questions  the wigged gentleman sitting
opposite  still looking at the ceiling of the court 

had he ever been a spy himself  no  he scorned the base insinuation 
what did he live upon  his property  where was his property  he didn  
precisely remember where it was  what was it  no business of anybody   
had he inherited it  yes  he had  from whom  distant relation  very
distant  rather  ever been in prison  certainly not  never in a debtors 
prison  didn   see what that had to do with it  never in a debtors 
prison   come  once again  never  yes  how many times  two or three
times  not five or six  perhaps  of what profession  gentleman  ever
been kicked  might have been  frequently  no  ever kicked downstairs 
decidedly not  once received a kick on the top of a staircase  and fell
downstairs of his own accord  kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice  something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault  but it was not true  swear it was not true 
positively  ever live by cheating at play  never  ever live by play  not
more than other gentlemen do  ever borrow money of the prisoner  yes 
ever pay him  no  was not this intimacy with the prisoner  in reality a
very slight one  forced upon the prisoner in coaches  inns  and packets 
no  sure he saw the prisoner with these lists  certain  knew no more
about the lists  no  had not procured them himself  for instance  no 
expect to get anything by this evidence  no  not in regular government
pay and employment  to lay traps  oh dear no  or to do anything  oh dear
no  swear that  over and over again  no motives but motives of sheer
patriotism  none whatever 

the virtuous servant  roger cly  swore his way through the case at a
great rate  he had taken service with the prisoner  in good faith and
simplicity  four years ago  he had asked the prisoner  aboard the calais
packet  if he wanted a handy fellow  and the prisoner had engaged him 
he had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity  never thought of such a thing  he began to have suspicions of
the prisoner  and to keep an eye upon him  soon afterwards  in arranging
his clothes  while travelling  he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner   pockets  over and over again  he had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner   desk  he had not put them there first  he
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to french gentlemen
at calais  and similar lists to french gentlemen  both at calais and
boulogne  he loved his country  and couldn   bear it  and had given
information  he had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea pot 
he had been maligned respecting a mustard pot  but it turned out to be
only a plated one  he had known the last witness seven or eight years 
that was merely a coincidence  he didn   call it a particularly curious
coincidence  most coincidences were curious  neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was  his  only motive too  he
was a true briton  and hoped there were many like him 

the blue flies buzzed again  and mr  attorney general called mr  jarvis
lorry 

 mr  jarvis lorry  are you a clerk in tellson   bank  

 i am  

 on a certain friday night in november one thousand seven hundred and
seventy five  did business occasion you to travel between london and
dover by the mail  

 it did  

 were there any other passengers in the mail  

 two  

 did they alight on the road in the course of the night  

 they did  

 mr  lorry  look upon the prisoner  was he one of those two passengers  

 i cannot undertake to say that he was  

 does he resemble either of these two passengers  

 both were so wrapped up  and the night was so dark  and we were all so
reserved  that i cannot undertake to say even that  

 mr  lorry  look again upon the prisoner  supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were  is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them  

 no  

 you will not swear  mr  lorry  that he was not one of them  

 no  

 so at least you say he may have been one of them  

 yes  except that i remember them both to have been  like
myself  timorous of highwaymen  and the prisoner has not a timorous
air  

 did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity  mr  lorry  

 i certainly have seen that  

 mr  lorry  look once more upon the prisoner  have you seen him  to your
certain knowledge  before  

 i have  

 when  

 i was returning from france a few days afterwards  and  at calais  the
prisoner came on board the packet ship in which i returned  and made the
voyage with me  

 at what hour did he come on board  

 at a little after midnight  

 in the dead of the night  was he the only passenger who came on board
at that untimely hour  

 he happened to be the only one  

 never mind about  happening   mr  lorry  he was the only passenger who
came on board in the dead of the night  

 he was  

 were you travelling alone  mr  lorry  or with any companion  

 with two companions  a gentleman and lady  they are here  

 they are here  had you any conversation with the prisoner  

 hardly any  the weather was stormy  and the passage long and rough  and
i lay on a sofa  almost from shore to shore  

 miss manette  

the young lady  to whom all eyes had been turned before  and were now
turned again  stood up where she had sat  her father rose with her  and
kept her hand drawn through his arm 

 miss manette  look upon the prisoner  

to be confronted with such pity  and such earnest youth and beauty  was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd 
standing  as it were  apart with her on the edge of his grave  not all
the staring curiosity that looked on  could  for the moment  nerve him
to remain quite still  his hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden  and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart  the buzz of the great flies was loud again 

 miss manette  have you seen the prisoner before  

 yes  sir  

 where  

 on board of the packet ship just now referred to  sir  and on the same
occasion  

 you are the young lady just now referred to  

 o  most unhappily  i am  

the plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the judge  as he said something fiercely   answer the questions put
to you  and make no remark upon them  

 miss manette  had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the channel  

 yes  sir  

 recall it  

in the midst of a profound stillness  she faintly began   when the
gentleman came on board   

 do you mean the prisoner   inquired the judge  knitting his brows 

 yes  my lord  

 then say the prisoner  

 when the prisoner came on board  he noticed that my father   turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her   was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health  my father was so reduced that i was
afraid to take him out of the air  and i had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps  and i sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him  there were no other passengers that night  but we four 
the prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how i could
shelter my father from the wind and weather  better than i had done  i
had not known how to do it well  not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour  he did it for me  he expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my father   state  and i am sure he
felt it  that was the manner of our beginning to speak together  

 let me interrupt you for a moment  had he come on board alone  

 no  

 how many were with him  

 two french gentlemen  

 had they conferred together  

 they had conferred together until the last moment  when it was
necessary for the french gentlemen to be landed in their boat  

 had any papers been handed about among them  similar to these lists  

 some papers had been handed about among them  but i don   know what
papers  

 like these in shape and size  

 possibly  but indeed i don   know  although they stood whispering very
near to me  because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there  it was a dull lamp  and they
spoke very low  and i did not hear what they said  and saw only that
they looked at papers  

 now  to the prisoner   conversation  miss manette  

 the prisoner was as open in his confidence with me  which arose out
of my helpless situation  as he was kind  and good  and useful to my
father  i hope   bursting into tears   i may not repay him by doing him
harm to day  

buzzing from the blue flies 

 miss manette  if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give  which you must
give  and which you cannot escape from giving  with great unwillingness 
he is the only person present in that condition  please to go on  

 he told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature  which might get people into trouble  and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name  he said that this business
had  within a few days  taken him to france  and might  at intervals 
take him backwards and forwards between france and england for a long
time to come  

 did he say anything about america  miss manette  be particular  

 he tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen  and he said
that  so far as he could judge  it was a wrong and foolish one on
england   part  he added  in a jesting way  that perhaps george
washington might gain almost as great a name in history as george the
third  but there was no harm in his way of saying this  it was said
laughingly  and to beguile the time  

any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed  will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators  her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence  and  in the pauses when
she stopped for the judge to write it down  watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against  among the lookers on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court  insomuch  that a great majority
of the foreheads there  might have been mirrors reflecting the witness 
when the judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about george washington 

mr  attorney general now signified to my lord  that he deemed it
necessary  as a matter of precaution and form  to call the young lady  
father  doctor manette  who was called accordingly 

 doctor manette  look upon the prisoner  have you ever seen him before  

 once  when he called at my lodgings in london  some three years  or
three years and a half ago  

 can you identify him as your fellow passenger on board the packet  or
speak to his conversation with your daughter  

 sir  i can do neither  

 is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either  

he answered  in a low voice   there is  

 has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment  without
trial  or even accusation  in your native country  doctor manette  

he answered  in a tone that went to every heart   a long imprisonment  

 were you newly released on the occasion in question  

 they tell me so  

 have you no remembrance of the occasion  

 none  my mind is a blank  from some time  i cannot even say what
time  when i employed myself  in my captivity  in making shoes  to the
time when i found myself living in london with my dear daughter
here  she had become familiar to me  when a gracious god restored
my faculties  but  i am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar  i have no remembrance of the process  

mr  attorney general sat down  and the father and daughter sat down
together 

a singular circumstance then arose in the case  the object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down  with some fellow plotter untracked 
in the dover mail on that friday night in november five years ago  and
got out of the mail in the night  as a blind  at a place where he did
not remain  but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more 
to a garrison and dockyard  and there collected information  a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required 
in the coffee room of an hotel in that garrison and dockyard town 
waiting for another person  the prisoner   counsel was cross examining
this witness with no result  except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion  when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court  wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper  screwed it up  and tossed it to him  opening
this piece of paper in the next pause  the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner 

 you say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner  

the witness was quite sure 

 did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner  

not so like  the witness said  as that he could be mistaken 

 look well upon that gentleman  my learned friend there   pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over   and then look well upon the
prisoner  how say you  are they very like each other  

allowing for my learned friend   appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched  they were sufficiently like each other to surprise 
not only the witness  but everybody present  when they were thus brought
into comparison  my lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig  and giving no very gracious consent  the likeness became
much more remarkable  my lord inquired of mr  stryver  the prisoner  
counsel   whether they were next to try mr  carton  name of my learned
friend  for treason  but  mr  stryver replied to my lord  no  but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once  might
happen twice  whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner  whether he would be so
confident  having seen it  and more  the upshot of which  was  to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel  and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber 

mr  cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence  he had now to attend while mr 
stryver fitted the prisoner   case on the jury  like a compact suit
of clothes  showing them how the patriot  barsad  was a hired spy and
traitor  an unblushing trafficker in blood  and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas  which he certainly did look
rather like  how the virtuous servant  cly  was his friend and partner 
and was worthy to be  how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim  because some family
affairs in france  he being of french extraction  did require his making
those passages across the channel  though what those affairs were  a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him  forbade him 
even for his life  to disclose  how the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady  whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed  came to nothing  involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together   with the exception of that
reference to george washington  which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke 
how it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears  and therefore mr  attorney general had made the most of it 
how  nevertheless  it rested upon nothing  save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases  and of which the
state trials of this country were full  but  there my lord interposed
 with as grave a face as if it had not been true   saying that he could
not sit upon that bench and suffer those allusions 

mr  stryver then called his few witnesses  and mr  cruncher had next to
attend while mr  attorney general turned the whole suit of clothes mr 
stryver had fitted on the jury  inside out  showing how barsad and
cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them  and the
prisoner a hundred times worse  lastly  came my lord himself  turning
the suit of clothes  now inside out  now outside in  but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave clothes for the prisoner 

and now  the jury turned to consider  and the great flies swarmed again 

mr  carton  who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court 
changed neither his place nor his attitude  even in this excitement 
while his learned friend  mr  stryver  massing his papers before him 
whispered with those who sat near  and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury  while all the spectators moved more or less  and
grouped themselves anew  while even my lord himself arose from his seat 
and slowly paced up and down his platform  not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish  this one man
sat leaning back  with his torn gown half off him  his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal  his
hands in his pockets  and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day  something especially reckless in his demeanour  not only gave him
a disreputable look  but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner  which his momentary earnestness 
when they were compared together  had strengthened   that many of the
lookers on  taking note of him now  said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike  mr  cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour  and added   i   hold half a guinea
that  he  don   get no law work to do  don   look like the sort of one
to get any  do he  

yet  this mr  carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in  for now  when miss manette   head dropped upon
her father   breast  he was the first to see it  and to say audibly 
 officer  look to that young lady  help the gentleman to take her out 
don   you see she will fall  

there was much commiseration for her as she was removed  and much
sympathy with her father  it had evidently been a great distress to
him  to have the days of his imprisonment recalled  he had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned  and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old  had been upon him  like a heavy cloud 
ever since  as he passed out  the jury  who had turned back and paused a
moment  spoke  through their foreman 

they were not agreed  and wished to retire  my lord  perhaps with george
washington on his mind  showed some surprise that they were not agreed 
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward 
and retired himself  the trial had lasted all day  and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted  it began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while  the spectators dropped off to get
refreshment  and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock  and sat
down 

mr  lorry  who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out 
now reappeared  and beckoned to jerry  who  in the slackened interest 
could easily get near him 

 jerry  if you wish to take something to eat  you can  but  keep in the
way  you will be sure to hear when the jury come in  don   be a moment
behind them  for i want you to take the verdict back to the bank  you
are the quickest messenger i know  and will get to temple bar long
before i can  

jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle  and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling  mr  carton came up
at the moment  and touched mr  lorry on the arm 

 how is the young lady  

 she is greatly distressed  but her father is comforting her  and she
feels the better for being out of court  

 i ll tell the prisoner so  it won   do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you  to be seen speaking to him publicly  you know  

mr  lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind  and mr  carton made his way to the outside of the bar 
the way out of court lay in that direction  and jerry followed him  all
eyes  ears  and spikes 

 mr  darnay  

the prisoner came forward directly 

 you will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness  miss manette  she
will do very well  you have seen the worst of her agitation  

 i am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it  could you tell her so
for me  with my fervent acknowledgments  

 yes  i could  i will  if you ask it  

mr  carton   manner was so careless as to be almost insolent  he stood 
half turned from the prisoner  lounging with his elbow against the bar 

 i do ask it  accept my cordial thanks  

 what   said carton  still only half turned towards him   do you expect 
mr  darnay  

 the worst  

 it   the wisest thing to expect  and the likeliest  but i think their
withdrawing is in your favour  

loitering on the way out of court not being allowed  jerry heard no
more  but left them  so like each other in feature  so unlike each other
in manner  standing side by side  both reflected in the glass above
them 

an hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief and rascal crowded
passages below  even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale 
the hoarse messenger  uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection  had dropped into a doze  when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court  carried him along
with them 

 jerry  jerry   mr  lorry was already calling at the door when he got
there 

 here  sir  it   a fight to get back again  here i am  sir  

mr  lorry handed him a paper through the throng   quick  have you got
it  

 yes  sir  

hastily written on the paper was the word  acquitted  

 if you had sent the message   recalled to life   again   muttered
jerry  as he turned   i should have known what you meant  this time  

he had no opportunity of saying  or so much as thinking  anything else 
until he was clear of the old bailey  for  the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs  and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion 




iv  congratulatory


from the dimly lighted passages of the court  the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day  was straining off  when
doctor manette  lucie manette  his daughter  mr  lorry  the solicitor
for the defence  and its counsel  mr  stryver  stood gathered round mr 
charles darnay  just released  congratulating him on his escape from
death 

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light  to recognise
in doctor manette  intellectual of face and upright of bearing  the
shoemaker of the garret in paris  yet  no one could have looked at him
twice  without looking again  even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice  and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully  without any apparent
reason  while one external cause  and that a reference to his long
lingering agony  would always  as on the trial  evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul  it was also in its nature to arise of
itself  and to draw a gloom over him  as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun  when the substance was three
hundred miles away 

only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind  she was the golden thread that united him to a past beyond his
misery  and to a present beyond his misery  and the sound of her voice 
the light of her face  the touch of her hand  had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always  not absolutely always  for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed  but they were few
and slight  and she believed them over 

mr  darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully  and had turned
to mr  stryver  whom he warmly thanked  mr  stryver  a man of little
more than thirty  but looking twenty years older than he was  stout 
loud  red  bluff  and free from any drawback of delicacy  had a pushing
way of shouldering himself  morally and physically  into companies and
conversations  that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life 

he still had his wig and gown on  and he said  squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent mr  lorry clean
out of the group   i am glad to have brought you off with honour  mr 
darnay  it was an infamous prosecution  grossly infamous  but not the
less likely to succeed on that account  

 you have laid me under an obligation to you for life  in two senses  
said his late client  taking his hand 

 i have done my best for you  mr  darnay  and my best is as good as
another man    i believe  

it clearly being incumbent on some one to say   much better   mr  lorry
said it  perhaps not quite disinterestedly  but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again 

 you think so   said mr  stryver   well  you have been present all day 
and you ought to know  you are a man of business  too  

 and as such   quoth mr  lorry  whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group  just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it   as such i will appeal to doctor manette  to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes  miss lucie looks ill  mr 
darnay has had a terrible day  we are worn out  

 speak for yourself  mr  lorry   said stryver   i have a night   work to
do yet  speak for yourself  

 i speak for myself   answered mr  lorry   and for mr  darnay  and for
miss lucie  and  miss lucie  do you not think i may speak for us all  
he asked her the question pointedly  and with a glance at her father 

his face had become frozen  as it were  in a very curious look at
darnay  an intent look  deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust 
not even unmixed with fear  with this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away 

 my father   said lucie  softly laying her hand on his 

he slowly shook the shadow off  and turned to her 

 shall we go home  my father  

with a long breath  he answered  yes  

the friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed  under the
impression  which he himself had originated  that he would not be
released that night  the lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages  the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle 
and the dismal place was deserted until to morrow morning   interest of
gallows  pillory  whipping post  and branding iron  should repeople it 
walking between her father and mr  darnay  lucie manette passed into
the open air  a hackney coach was called  and the father and daughter
departed in it 

mr  stryver had left them in the passages  to shoulder his way back
to the robing room  another person  who had not joined the group  or
interchanged a word with any one of them  but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest  had silently strolled
out after the rest  and had looked on until the coach drove away  he now
stepped up to where mr  lorry and mr  darnay stood upon the pavement 

 so  mr  lorry  men of business may speak to mr  darnay now  

nobody had made any acknowledgment of mr  carton   part in the day  
proceedings  nobody had known of it  he was unrobed  and was none the
better for it in appearance 

 if you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind  when the
business mind is divided between good natured impulse and business
appearances  you would be amused  mr  darnay  

mr  lorry reddened  and said  warmly   you have mentioned that before 
sir  we men of business  who serve a house  are not our own masters  we
have to think of the house more than ourselves  

  i  know   i  know   rejoined mr  carton  carelessly   don   be
nettled  mr  lorry  you are as good as another  i have no doubt  better 
i dare say  

 and indeed  sir   pursued mr  lorry  not minding him   i really don  
know what you have to do with the matter  if you ll excuse me  as very
much your elder  for saying so  i really don   know that it is your
business  

 business  bless you   i  have no business   said mr  carton 

 it is a pity you have not  sir  

 i think so  too  

 if you had   pursued mr  lorry   perhaps you would attend to it  

 lord love you  no   i shouldn     said mr  carton 

 well  sir   cried mr  lorry  thoroughly heated by his indifference 
 business is a very good thing  and a very respectable thing  and  sir 
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments  mr 
darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance  mr  darnay  good night  god bless you  sir 
i hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life   chair there  

perhaps a little angry with himself  as well as with the barrister  mr 
lorry bustled into the chair  and was carried off to tellson    carton 
who smelt of port wine  and did not appear to be quite sober  laughed
then  and turned to darnay 

 this is a strange chance that throws you and me together  this must
be a strange night to you  standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones  

 i hardly seem yet   returned charles darnay   to belong to this world
again  

 i don   wonder at it  it   not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another  you speak faintly  

 i begin to think i  am  faint  

 then why the devil don   you dine  i dined  myself  while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to  this  or
some other  let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at  

drawing his arm through his own  he took him down ludgate hill to
fleet street  and so  up a covered way  into a tavern  here  they were
shown into a little room  where charles darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine  while carton sat
opposite to him at the same table  with his separate bottle of port
before him  and his fully half insolent manner upon him 

 do you feel  yet  that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again  mr 
darnay  

 i am frightfully confused regarding time and place  but i am so far
mended as to feel that  

 it must be an immense satisfaction  

he said it bitterly  and filled up his glass again  which was a large
one 

 as to me  the greatest desire i have  is to forget that i belong to it 
it has no good in it for me  except wine like this  nor i for it  so we
are not much alike in that particular  indeed  i begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular  you and i  

confused by the emotion of the day  and feeling his being there with
this double of coarse deportment  to be like a dream  charles darnay was
at a loss how to answer  finally  answered not at all 

 now your dinner is done   carton presently said   why don   you call a
health  mr  darnay  why don   you give your toast  

 what health  what toast  

 why  it   on the tip of your tongue  it ought to be  it must be  i ll
swear it   there  

 miss manette  then  

 miss manette  then  

looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast  carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall  where it shivered to
pieces  then  rang the bell  and ordered in another 

 that   a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark  mr  darnay  
he said  filling his new goblet 

a slight frown and a laconic  yes   were the answer 

 that   a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by  how does it
feel  is it worth being tried for one   life  to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion  mr  darnay  

again darnay answered not a word 

 she was mightily pleased to have your message  when i gave it her  not
that she showed she was pleased  but i suppose she was  

the allusion served as a timely reminder to darnay that this
disagreeable companion had  of his own free will  assisted him in the
strait of the day  he turned the dialogue to that point  and thanked him
for it 

 i neither want any thanks  nor merit any   was the careless rejoinder 
 it was nothing to do  in the first place  and i don   know why i did
it  in the second  mr  darnay  let me ask you a question  

 willingly  and a small return for your good offices  

 do you think i particularly like you  

 really  mr  carton   returned the other  oddly disconcerted   i have
not asked myself the question  

 but ask yourself the question now  

 you have acted as if you do  but i don   think you do  

  i  don   think i do   said carton   i begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding  

 nevertheless   pursued darnay  rising to ring the bell   there is
nothing in that  i hope  to prevent my calling the reckoning  and our
parting without ill blood on either side  

carton rejoining   nothing in life   darnay rang   do you call the whole
reckoning   said carton  on his answering in the affirmative   then
bring me another pint of this same wine  drawer  and come and wake me at
ten  

the bill being paid  charles darnay rose and wished him good night 
without returning the wish  carton rose too  with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner  and said   a last word  mr  darnay  you think
i am drunk  

 i think you have been drinking  mr  carton  

 think  you know i have been drinking  

 since i must say so  i know it  

 then you shall likewise know why  i am a disappointed drudge  sir  i
care for no man on earth  and no man on earth cares for me  

 much to be regretted  you might have used your talents better  

 may be so  mr  darnay  may be not  don   let your sober face elate you 
however  you don   know what it may come to  good night  

when he was left alone  this strange being took up a candle  went to a
glass that hung against the wall  and surveyed himself minutely in it 

 do you particularly like the man   he muttered  at his own image   why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you  there is nothing
in you to like  you know that  ah  confound you  what a change you have
made in yourself  a good reason for taking to a man  that he shows you
what you have fallen away from  and what you might have been  change
places with him  and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was  and commiserated by that agitated face as he was  come on  and
have it out in plain words  you hate the fellow  

he resorted to his pint of wine for consolation  drank it all in a few
minutes  and fell asleep on his arms  with his hair straggling over the
table  and a long winding sheet in the candle dripping down upon him 




   the jackal


those were drinking days  and most men drank hard  so very great is
the improvement time has brought about in such habits  that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night  without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman  would seem  in these days  a ridiculous exaggeration 
the learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its bacchanalian propensities  neither was mr 
stryver  already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice  behind his compeers in this particular  any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race 

a favourite at the old bailey  and eke at the sessions  mr  stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted  sessions and old bailey had now to summon their favourite 
specially  to their longing arms  and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the lord chief justice in the court of king   bench  the
florid countenance of mr  stryver might be daily seen  bursting out of
the bed of wigs  like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden full of flaring companions 

it had once been noted at the bar  that while mr  stryver was a glib
man  and an unscrupulous  and a ready  and a bold  he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements  which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate   accomplishments 
but  a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this  the more
business he got  the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow  and however late at night he sat carousing with sydney
carton  he always had his points at his fingers  ends in the morning 

sydney carton  idlest and most unpromising of men  was stryver   great
ally  what the two drank together  between hilary term and michaelmas 
might have floated a king   ship  stryver never had a case in hand 
anywhere  but carton was there  with his hands in his pockets  staring
at the ceiling of the court  they went the same circuit  and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night  and carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day  going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings  like a dissipated cat  at last  it began to get about 
among such as were interested in the matter  that although sydney carton
would never be a lion  he was an amazingly good jackal  and that he
rendered suit and service to stryver in that humble capacity 

 ten o clock  sir   said the man at the tavern  whom he had charged to
wake him   ten o clock  sir  

  what    the matter  

 ten o clock  sir  

 what do you mean  ten o clock at night  

 yes  sir  your honour told me to call you  

 oh  i remember  very well  very well  

after a few dull efforts to get to sleep again  which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes 
he got up  tossed his hat on  and walked out  he turned into the temple 
and  having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of king  
bench walk and paper buildings  turned into the stryver chambers 

the stryver clerk  who never assisted at these conferences  had gone
home  and the stryver principal opened the door  he had his slippers on 
and a loose bed gown  and his throat was bare for his greater ease  he
had that rather wild  strained  seared marking about the eyes  which
may be observed in all free livers of his class  from the portrait of
jeffries downward  and which can be traced  under various disguises of
art  through the portraits of every drinking age 

 you are a little late  memory   said stryver 

 about the usual time  it may be a quarter of an hour later  

they went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers 
where there was a blazing fire  a kettle steamed upon the hob  and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone  with plenty of wine upon
it  and brandy  and rum  and sugar  and lemons 

 you have had your bottle  i perceive  sydney  

 two to night  i think  i have been dining with the day   client  or
seeing him dine  it   all one  

 that was a rare point  sydney  that you brought to bear upon the
identification  how did you come by it  when did it strike you  

 i thought he was rather a handsome fellow  and i thought i should have
been much the same sort of fellow  if i had had any luck  

mr  stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch 

 you and your luck  sydney  get to work  get to work  

sullenly enough  the jackal loosened his dress  went into an adjoining
room  and came back with a large jug of cold water  a basin  and a towel
or two  steeping the towels in the water  and partially wringing them
out  he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold  sat down
at the table  and said   now i am ready  

 not much boiling down to be done to night  memory   said mr  stryver 
gaily  as he looked among his papers 

 how much  

 only two sets of them  

 give me the worst first  

 there they are  sydney  fire away  

the lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking table  while the jackal sat at his own paper bestrewn table
proper  on the other side of it  with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand  both resorted to the drinking table without stint  but each in
a different way  the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband  looking at the fire  or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document  the jackal  with knitted brows and intent face 
so deep in his task  that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass  which often groped about  for a minute or
more  before it found the glass for his lips  two or three times  the
matter in hand became so knotty  that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up  and steep his towels anew  from these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin  he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe  which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity 

at length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion  and
proceeded to offer it to him  the lion took it with care and caution 
made his selections from it  and his remarks upon it  and the jackal
assisted both  when the repast was fully discussed  the lion put his
hands in his waistband again  and lay down to meditate  the jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle  and a fresh application
to his head  and applied himself to the collection of a second meal 
this was administered to the lion in the same manner  and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning 

 and now we have done  sydney  fill a bumper of punch   said mr 
stryver 

the jackal removed the towels from his head  which had been steaming
again  shook himself  yawned  shivered  and complied 

 you were very sound  sydney  in the matter of those crown witnesses
to day  every question told  

 i always am sound  am i not  

 i don   gainsay it  what has roughened your temper  put some punch to
it and smooth it again  

with a deprecatory grunt  the jackal again complied 

 the old sydney carton of old shrewsbury school   said stryver  nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past   the
old seesaw sydney  up one minute and down the next  now in spirits and
now in despondency  

 ah   returned the other  sighing   yes  the same sydney  with the same
luck  even then  i did exercises for other boys  and seldom did my own  

 and why not  

 god knows  it was my way  i suppose  

he sat  with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him  looking at the fire 

 carton   said his friend  squaring himself at him with a bullying air 
as if the fire grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged  and the one delicate thing to be done for the old sydney
carton of old shrewsbury school was to shoulder him into it   your way
is  and always was  a lame way  you summon no energy and purpose  look
at me  

 oh  botheration   returned sydney  with a lighter and more
good humoured laugh   don    you  be moral  

 how have i done what i have done   said stryver   how do i do what i
do  

 partly through paying me to help you  i suppose  but it   not worth
your while to apostrophise me  or the air  about it  what you want to
do  you do  you were always in the front rank  and i was always behind  

 i had to get into the front rank  i was not born there  was i  

 i was not present at the ceremony  but my opinion is you were   said
carton  at this  he laughed again  and they both laughed 

 before shrewsbury  and at shrewsbury  and ever since shrewsbury  
pursued carton   you have fallen into your rank  and i have fallen into
mine  even when we were fellow students in the student quarter of paris 
picking up french  and french law  and other french crumbs that we
didn   get much good of  you were always somewhere  and i was always
nowhere  

 and whose fault was that  

 upon my soul  i am not sure that it was not yours  you were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing  to that restless degree
that i had no chance for my life but in rust and repose  it   a gloomy
thing  however  to talk about one   own past  with the day breaking 
turn me in some other direction before i go  

 well then  pledge me to the pretty witness   said stryver  holding up
his glass   are you turned in a pleasant direction  

apparently not  for he became gloomy again 

 pretty witness   he muttered  looking down into his glass   i have had
enough of witnesses to day and to night  who   your pretty witness  

 the picturesque doctor   daughter  miss manette  

  she  pretty  

 is she not  

 no  

 why  man alive  she was the admiration of the whole court  

 rot the admiration of the whole court  who made the old bailey a judge
of beauty  she was a golden haired doll  

 do you know  sydney   said mr  stryver  looking at him with sharp eyes 
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face   do you know  i rather
thought  at the time  that you sympathised with the golden haired doll 
and were quick to see what happened to the golden haired doll  

 quick to see what happened  if a girl  doll or no doll  swoons within a
yard or two of a man   nose  he can see it without a perspective glass 
i pledge you  but i deny the beauty  and now i ll have no more drink 
i ll get to bed  

when his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle  to light
him down the stairs  the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows  when he got out of the house  the air was cold and sad  the
dull sky overcast  the river dark and dim  the whole scene like a
lifeless desert  and wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast  as if the desert sand had risen far away  and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city 

waste forces within him  and a desert all around  this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace  and saw for a moment  lying in the
wilderness before him  a mirage of honourable ambition  self denial  and
perseverance  in the fair city of this vision  there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him  gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening  waters of hope that sparkled in his sight 
a moment  and it was gone  climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses  he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed  and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears 

sadly  sadly  the sun rose  it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions  incapable of their directed exercise 
incapable of his own help and his own happiness  sensible of the blight
on him  and resigning himself to let it eat him away 




vi  hundreds of people


the quiet lodgings of doctor manette were in a quiet street corner not
far from soho square  on the afternoon of a certain fine sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason  and carried
it  as to the public interest and memory  far out to sea  mr  jarvis
lorry walked along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where he lived 
on his way to dine with the doctor  after several relapses into
business absorption  mr  lorry had become the doctor   friend  and the
quiet street corner was the sunny part of his life 

on this certain fine sunday  mr  lorry walked towards soho  early in
the afternoon  for three reasons of habit  firstly  because  on fine
sundays  he often walked out  before dinner  with the doctor and lucie 
secondly  because  on unfavourable sundays  he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend  talking  reading  looking out of window  and
generally getting through the day  thirdly  because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve  and knew how the ways of the
doctor   household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them 

a quainter corner than the corner where the doctor lived  was not to be
found in london  there was no way through it  and the front windows of
the doctor   lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it  there were few buildings then 
north of the oxford road  and forest trees flourished  and wild flowers
grew  and the hawthorn blossomed  in the now vanished fields  as a
consequence  country airs circulated in soho with vigorous freedom 
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement  and there was many a good south wall  not far off  on which
the peaches ripened in their season 

the summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day  but  when the streets grew hot  the corner was in shadow 
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness  it was a cool spot  staid but cheerful  a wonderful
place for echoes  and a very harbour from the raging streets 

there ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage  and
there was  the doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house  where
several callings purported to be pursued by day  but whereof little was
audible any day  and which was shunned by all of them at night  in
a building at the back  attainable by a courtyard where a plane tree
rustled its green leaves  church organs claimed to be made  and silver
to be chased  and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall  as if
he had beaten himself precious  and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors  very little of these trades  or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up stairs  or of a dim coach trimming maker asserted to have
a counting house below  was ever heard or seen  occasionally  a stray
workman putting his coat on  traversed the hall  or a stranger peered
about there  or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard  or a
thump from the golden giant  these  however  were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane tree behind
the house  and the echoes in the corner before it  had their own way
from sunday morning unto saturday night 

doctor manette received such patients here as his old reputation  and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story  brought him 
his scientific knowledge  and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments  brought him otherwise into moderate request  and
he earned as much as he wanted 

these things were within mr  jarvis lorry   knowledge  thoughts  and
notice  when he rang the door bell of the tranquil house in the corner 
on the fine sunday afternoon 

 doctor manette at home  

expected home 

 miss lucie at home  

expected home 

 miss pross at home  

possibly at home  but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pross  as to admission or denial of the
fact 

 as i am at home myself   said mr  lorry   i ll go upstairs  

although the doctor   daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth  she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means  which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics  simple as the furniture was  it was set off
by so many little adornments  of no value but for their taste and fancy 
that its effect was delightful  the disposition of everything in the
rooms  from the largest object to the least  the arrangement of colours 
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles  by
delicate hands  clear eyes  and good sense  were at once so pleasant in
themselves  and so expressive of their originator  that  as mr  lorry
stood looking about him  the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him 
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time  whether he approved 

there were three rooms on a floor  and  the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all  mr  lorry  smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him  walked from one to another  the first was
the best room  and in it were lucie   birds  and flowers  and books 
and desk  and work table  and box of water colours  the second was
the doctor   consulting room  used also as the dining room  the third 
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane tree in the yard  was the
doctor   bedroom  and there  in a corner  stood the disused shoemaker  
bench and tray of tools  much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine shop  in the suburb of saint antoine in paris 

 i wonder   said mr  lorry  pausing in his looking about   that he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him  

 and why wonder at that   was the abrupt inquiry that made him start 

it proceeded from miss pross  the wild red woman  strong of hand  whose
acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover  and
had since improved 

 i should have thought    mr  lorry began 

 pooh  you   have thought   said miss pross  and mr  lorry left off 

 how do you do   inquired that lady then  sharply  and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice 

 i am pretty well  i thank you   answered mr  lorry  with meekness   how
are you  

 nothing to boast of   said miss pross 

 indeed  

 ah  indeed   said miss pross   i am very much put out about my
ladybird  

 indeed  

 for gracious sake say something else besides  indeed   or you ll
fidget me to death   said miss pross  whose character  dissociated from
stature  was shortness 

 really  then   said mr  lorry  as an amendment 

 really  is bad enough   returned miss pross   but better  yes  i am
very much put out  

 may i ask the cause  

 i don   want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird  to
come here looking after her   said miss pross 

  do  dozens come for that purpose  

 hundreds   said miss pross 

it was characteristic of this lady  as of some other people before her
time and since  that whenever her original proposition was questioned 
she exaggerated it 

 dear me   said mr  lorry  as the safest remark he could think of 

 i have lived with the darling  or the darling has lived with me  and
paid me for it  which she certainly should never have done  you may take
your affidavit  if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing  since she was ten years old  and it   really very hard  
said miss pross 

not seeing with precision what was very hard  mr  lorry shook his head 
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything 

 all sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet 
are always turning up   said miss pross   when you began it   

  i  began it  miss pross  

 didn   you  who brought her father to life  

 oh  if  that  was beginning it    said mr  lorry 

 it wasn   ending it  i suppose  i say  when you began it  it was hard
enough  not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette  except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter  which is no imputation on
him  for it was not to be expected that anybody should be  under any
circumstances  but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him  i could have forgiven
him   to take ladybird   affections away from me  

mr  lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous  but he also knew her by
this time to be  beneath the service of her eccentricity  one of those
unselfish creatures  found only among women  who will  for pure love and
admiration  bind themselves willing slaves  to youth when they have lost
it  to beauty that they never had  to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain  to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives  he knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart  so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint  he had such an exalted
respect for it  that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind  we all make such arrangements  more or less  he stationed miss
pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by nature and art  who had balances at tellson   

 there never was  nor will be  but one man worthy of ladybird   said
miss pross   and that was my brother solomon  if he hadn   made a
mistake in life  

here again  mr  lorry   inquiries into miss pross   personal history had
established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed  as a stake to
speculate with  and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore  with
no touch of compunction  miss pross   fidelity of belief in solomon
 deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake  was quite a serious
matter with mr  lorry  and had its weight in his good opinion of her 

 as we happen to be alone for the moment  and are both people of
business   he said  when they had got back to the drawing room and had
sat down there in friendly relations   let me ask you  does the doctor 
in talking with lucie  never refer to the shoemaking time  yet  

 never  

 and yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him  

 ah   returned miss pross  shaking her head   but i don   say he don  
refer to it within himself  

 do you believe that he thinks of it much  

 i do   said miss pross 

 do you imagine    mr  lorry had begun  when miss pross took him up
short with 

 never imagine anything  have no imagination at all  

 i stand corrected  do you suppose  you go so far as to suppose 
sometimes  

 now and then   said miss pross 

 do you suppose   mr  lorry went on  with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye  as it looked kindly at her   that doctor manette has any
theory of his own  preserved through all those years  relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed  perhaps  even to the name of his
oppressor  

 i don   suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me  

 and that is    

 that she thinks he has  

 now don   be angry at my asking all these questions  because i am a
mere dull man of business  and you are a woman of business  

 dull   miss pross inquired  with placidity 

rather wishing his modest adjective away  mr  lorry replied   no  no 
no  surely not  to return to business   is it not remarkable that doctor
manette  unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is  should never touch upon that question  i will not say with me 
though he had business relations with me many years ago  and we are now
intimate  i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached  and who is so devotedly attached to him  believe me  miss
pross  i don   approach the topic with you  out of curiosity  but out of
zealous interest  

 well  to the best of my understanding  and bad   the best  you ll tell
me   said miss pross  softened by the tone of the apology   he is afraid
of the whole subject  

 afraid  

 it   plain enough  i should think  why he may be  it   a dreadful
remembrance  besides that  his loss of himself grew out of it  not
knowing how he lost himself  or how he recovered himself  he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again  that alone wouldn   make the
subject pleasant  i should think  

it was a profounder remark than mr  lorry had looked for   true   said
he   and fearful to reflect upon  yet  a doubt lurks in my mind  miss
pross  whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him  indeed  it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence  

 can   be helped   said miss pross  shaking her head   touch that
string  and he instantly changes for the worse  better leave it alone 
in short  must leave it alone  like or no like  sometimes  he gets up in
the dead of the night  and will be heard  by us overhead there  walking
up and down  walking up and down  in his room  ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down  walking up and down  in
his old prison  she hurries to him  and they go on together  walking up
and down  walking up and down  until he is composed  but he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness  to her  and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him  in silence they go walking up and down
together  walking up and down together  till her love and company have
brought him to himself  

notwithstanding miss pross   denial of her own imagination  there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea 
in her repetition of the phrase  walking up and down  which testified to
her possessing such a thing 

the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes  it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet  that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going 

 here they are   said miss pross  rising to break up the conference 
 and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon  

it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties  such a
peculiar ear of a place  that as mr  lorry stood at the open window 
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard  he fancied
they would never approach  not only would the echoes die away  as though
the steps had gone  but  echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead  and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand  however  father and daughter did at last appear  and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them 

miss pross was a pleasant sight  albeit wild  and red  and grim  taking
off her darling   bonnet when she came up stairs  and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief  and blowing the dust off it  and
folding her mantle ready for laying by  and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women  her darling was a pleasant
sight too  embracing her and thanking her  and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her  which last she only dared to do
playfully  or miss pross  sorely hurt  would have retired to her own
chamber and cried  the doctor was a pleasant sight too  looking on at
them  and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie  in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had  and would
have had more if it were possible  mr  lorry was a pleasant sight too 
beaming at all this in his little wig  and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home  but  no
hundreds of people came to see the sights  and mr  lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of miss pross   prediction 

dinner time  and still no hundreds of people  in the arrangements of
the little household  miss pross took charge of the lower regions  and
always acquitted herself marvellously  her dinners  of a very modest
quality  were so well cooked and so well served  and so neat in their
contrivances  half english and half french  that nothing could be
better  miss pross   friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind  she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces  in search of
impoverished french  who  tempted by shillings and half crowns  would
impart culinary mysteries to her  from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul  she had acquired such wonderful arts  that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress 
or cinderella   godmother  who would send out for a fowl  a rabbit 
a vegetable or two from the garden  and change them into anything she
pleased 

on sundays  miss pross dined at the doctor   table  but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods  either in the lower
regions  or in her own room on the second floor  a blue chamber  to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance  on this occasion 
miss pross  responding to ladybird   pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her  unbent exceedingly  so the dinner was very pleasant  too 

it was an oppressive day  and  after dinner  lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane tree  and they should sit
there in the air  as everything turned upon her  and revolved about her 
they went out under the plane tree  and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of mr  lorry  she had installed herself  some
time before  as mr  lorry   cup bearer  and while they sat under the
plane tree  talking  she kept his glass replenished  mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked  and the plane tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads 

still  the hundreds of people did not present themselves  mr  darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree  but he
was only one 

doctor manette received him kindly  and so did lucie  but  miss pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body  and
retired into the house  she was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder  and she called it  in familiar conversation   a fit of the
jerks  

the doctor was in his best condition  and looked specially young  the
resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times  and as
they sat side by side  she leaning on his shoulder  and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair  it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness 

he had been talking all day  on many subjects  and with unusual
vivacity   pray  doctor manette   said mr  darnay  as they sat under the
plane tree  and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand 
which happened to be the old buildings of london   have you seen much of
the tower  

 lucie and i have been there  but only casually  we have seen enough of
it  to know that it teems with interest  little more  

  i  have been there  as you remember   said darnay  with a smile 
though reddening a little angrily   in another character  and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it  they told me a
curious thing when i was there  

 what was that   lucie asked 

 in making some alterations  the workmen came upon an old dungeon  which
had been  for many years  built up and forgotten  every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners  dates  names  complaints  and prayers  upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall  one prisoner  who seemed to have gone to
execution  had cut as his last work  three letters  they were done with
some very poor instrument  and hurriedly  with an unsteady hand 
at first  they were read as    i      but  on being more carefully
examined  the last letter was found to be    there was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials  and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been  at length  it was suggested
that the letters were not initials  but the complete word  dig  the
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription  and  in the
earth beneath a stone  or tile  or some fragment of paving  were found
the ashes of a paper  mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag  what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read  but he
had written something  and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler  

 my father   exclaimed lucie   you are ill  

he had suddenly started up  with his hand to his head  his manner and
his look quite terrified them all 

 no  my dear  not ill  there are large drops of rain falling  and they
made me start  we had better go in  

he recovered himself almost instantly  rain was really falling in large
drops  and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it  but  he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of  and  as they went into the house  the business eye of mr  lorry
either detected  or fancied it detected  on his face  as it turned
towards charles darnay  the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house 

he recovered himself so quickly  however  that mr  lorry had doubts of
his business eye  the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was  when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises  if he ever would be   and
that the rain had startled him 

tea time  and miss pross making tea  with another fit of the jerks upon
her  and yet no hundreds of people  mr  carton had lounged in  but he
made only two 

the night was so very sultry  that although they sat with doors and
windows open  they were overpowered by heat  when the tea table was
done with  they all moved to one of the windows  and looked out into the
heavy twilight  lucie sat by her father  darnay sat beside her  carton
leaned against a window  the curtains were long and white  and some of
the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner  caught them up to the
ceiling  and waved them like spectral wings 

 the rain drops are still falling  large  heavy  and few   said doctor
manette   it comes slowly  

 it comes surely   said carton 

they spoke low  as people watching and waiting mostly do  as people in a
dark room  watching and waiting for lightning  always do 

there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke  the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going  yet not a
footstep was there 

 a multitude of people  and yet a solitude   said darnay  when they had
listened for a while 

 is it not impressive  mr  darnay   asked lucie   sometimes  i have
sat here of an evening  until i have fancied  but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night  when all is so black and
solemn   

 let us shudder too  we may know what it is  

 it will seem nothing to you  such whims are only impressive as we
originate them  i think  they are not to be communicated  i have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening  listening  until i have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by and bye into our lives  

 there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives  if that be so  
sydney carton struck in  in his moody way 

the footsteps were incessant  and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid  the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet  some 
as it seemed  under the windows  some  as it seemed  in the room  some
coming  some going  some breaking off  some stopping altogether  all in
the distant streets  and not one within sight 

 are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us  miss manette  or
are we to divide them among us  

 i don   know  mr  darnay  i told you it was a foolish fancy  but you
asked for it  when i have yielded myself to it  i have been alone  and
then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life  and my father    

 i take them into mine   said carton    i  ask no questions and make no
stipulations  there is a great crowd bearing down upon us  miss manette 
and i see them  by the lightning   he added the last words  after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window 

 and i hear them   he added again  after a peal of thunder   here they
come  fast  fierce  and furious  

it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified  and it stopped him 
for no voice could be heard in it  a memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water  and there was not a moment  
interval in crash  and fire  and rain  until after the moon rose at
midnight 

the great bell of saint paul   was striking one in the cleared air  when
mr  lorry  escorted by jerry  high booted and bearing a lantern  set
forth on his return passage to clerkenwell  there were solitary patches
of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell  and mr  lorry  mindful
of foot pads  always retained jerry for this service  though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier 

 what a night it has been  almost a night  jerry   said mr  lorry   to
bring the dead out of their graves  

 i never see the night myself  master  nor yet i don   expect to  what
would do that   answered jerry 

 good night  mr  carton   said the man of business   good night  mr 
darnay  shall we ever see such a night again  together  

perhaps  perhaps  see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar 
bearing down upon them  too 




vii  monseigneur in town


monseigneur  one of the great lords in power at the court  held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris  monseigneur was in
his inner room  his sanctuary of sanctuaries  the holiest of holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without  monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate  monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease  and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing france  but  his morning   chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of monseigneur  without the aid of four
strong men besides the cook 

yes  it took four men  all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration  and the
chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket  emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur  to
conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur   lips  one lacquey carried
the chocolate pot into the sacred presence  a second  milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function 
a third  presented the favoured napkin  a fourth  he of the two gold
watches   poured the chocolate out  it was impossible for monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring heavens  deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men  he must have died of two 

monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night  where the comedy
and the grand opera were charmingly represented  monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights  with fascinating company  so polite and so
impressible was monseigneur  that the comedy and the grand opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets  than the needs of all france  a happy circumstance
for france  as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured   always was for england  by way of example   in the regretted
days of the merry stuart who sold it 

monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business  which
was  to let everything go on in its own way  of particular public
business  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way  tend to his own power and pocket  of his pleasures  general and
particular  monseigneur had the other truly noble idea  that the world
was made for them  the text of his order  altered from the original
by only a pronoun  which is not much  ran   the earth and the fulness
thereof are mine  saith monseigneur  

yet  monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs  both private and public  and he had  as to both classes of
affairs  allied himself perforce with a farmer general  as to finances
public  because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them  and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could  as to finances
private  because farmer generals were rich  and monseigneur  after
generations of great luxury and expense  was growing poor  hence
monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent  while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil  the cheapest garment she could
wear  and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general 
poor in family  which farmer general  carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it  was now among the company in the outer
rooms  much prostrated before by mankind  always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of monseigneur  who  his own wife included  looked
down upon him with the loftiest contempt 

a sumptuous man was the farmer general  thirty horses stood in his
stables  twenty four male domestics sat in his halls  six body women
waited on his wife  as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could  the farmer general  howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality  was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day 

for  the rooms  though a beautiful scene to look at  and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve  were  in truth  not a sound business  considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere  and not
so far off  either  but that the watching towers of notre dame  almost
equidistant from the two extremes  could see them both   they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business  if that could have
been anybody   business  at the house of monseigneur  military officers
destitute of military knowledge  naval officers with no idea of a ship 
civil officers without a notion of affairs  brazen ecclesiastics  of the
worst world worldly  with sensual eyes  loose tongues  and looser lives 
all totally unfit for their several callings  all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them  but all nearly or remotely of the order of
monseigneur  and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got  these were to be told off by the score and the
score  people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state 
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real  or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end  were
no less abundant  doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed  smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur  projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
state was touched  except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin  poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of  at the reception of monseigneur  unbelieving
philosophers who were remodelling the world with words  and making
card towers of babel to scale the skies with  talked with unbelieving
chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals  at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur  exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding  which was at that remarkable time  and has been
since  to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest  were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion  at the hotel of monseigneur  such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris  that the spies
among the assembled devotees of monseigneur  forming a goodly half
of the polite company  would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife  who  in her manners and
appearance  owned to being a mother  indeed  except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world  which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother  there was no such thing
known to the fashion  peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close 
and brought them up  and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty 

the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon monseigneur  in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had  for a few years  some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong  as a promising way of setting
them right  half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of convulsionists  and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam  rage  roar  and turn cataleptic on the
spot  thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the
future  for monseigneur   guidance  besides these dervishes  were other
three who had rushed into another sect  which mended matters with a
jargon about  the centre of truth   holding that man had got out of the
centre of truth  which did not need much demonstration  but had not got
out of the circumference  and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the circumference  and was even to be shoved back into the centre 
by fasting and seeing of spirits  among these  accordingly  much
discoursing with spirits went on  and it did a world of good which never
became manifest 

but  the comfort was  that all the company at the grand hotel of
monseigneur were perfectly dressed  if the day of judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day  everybody there would have been eternally
correct  such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair  such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended  such gallant
swords to look at  and such delicate honour to the sense of smell  would
surely keep anything going  for ever and ever  the exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved  these golden fetters rang like precious little bells 
and what with that ringing  and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen  there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and
his devouring hunger far away 

dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places  everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that
was never to leave off  from the palace of the tuileries  through
monseigneur and the whole court  through the chambers  the tribunals
of justice  and all society  except the scarecrows   the fancy ball
descended to the common executioner  who  in pursuance of the charm  was
required to officiate  frizzled  powdered  in a gold laced coat  pumps 
and white silk stockings   at the gallows and the wheel  the axe was a
rarity  monsieur paris  as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
professors of the provinces  monsieur orleans  and the rest  to call
him  presided in this dainty dress  and who among the company at
monseigneur   reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our lord  could possibly doubt  that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman  powdered  gold laced  pumped  and white silk stockinged  would
see the very stars out 

monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate  caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown
open  and issued forth  then  what submission  what cringing and
fawning  what servility  what abject humiliation  as to bowing down in
body and spirit  nothing in that way was left for heaven  which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never
troubled it 

bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there  a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another  monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of
truth  there  monseigneur turned  and came back again  and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites  and was seen no more 

the show being over  the flutter in the air became quite a little storm 
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs  there was soon
but one person left of all the crowd  and he  with his hat under his arm
and his snuff box in his hand  slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out 

 i devote you   said this person  stopping at the last door on his way 
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary   to the devil  

with that  he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet  and quietly walked downstairs 

he was a man of about sixty  handsomely dressed  haughty in manner  and
with a face like a fine mask  a face of a transparent paleness  every
feature in it clearly defined  one set expression on it  the nose 
beautifully formed otherwise  was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril  in those two compressions  or dints  the only little
change that the face ever showed  resided  they persisted in changing
colour sometimes  and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation  then  they gave a look of
treachery  and cruelty  to the whole countenance  examined with
attention  its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth  and the lines of the orbits of the eyes  being much
too horizontal and thin  still  in the effect of the face made  it was a
handsome face  and a remarkable one 

its owner went downstairs into the courtyard  got into his carriage  and
drove away  not many people had talked with him at the reception  he had
stood in a little space apart  and monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner  it appeared  under the circumstances  rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses  and
often barely escaping from being run down  his man drove as if he were
charging an enemy  and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face  or to the lips  of the master  the complaint had
sometimes made itself audible  even in that deaf city and dumb age 
that  in the narrow streets without footways  the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner  but  few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time  and  in this matter  as in all others  the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could 

with a wild rattle and clatter  and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days  the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners  with women screaming
before it  and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way  at last  swooping at a street corner by a fountain  one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt  and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices  and the horses reared and plunged 

but for the latter inconvenience  the carriage probably would not have
stopped  carriages were often known to drive on  and leave their wounded
behind  and why not  but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry 
and there were twenty hands at the horses  bridles 

 what has gone wrong   said monsieur  calmly looking out 

a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses  and had laid it on the basement of the fountain  and was
down in the mud and wet  howling over it like a wild animal 

 pardon  monsieur the marquis   said a ragged and submissive man   it is
a child  

 why does he make that abominable noise  is it his child  

 excuse me  monsieur the marquis  it is a pity  yes  

the fountain was a little removed  for the street opened  where it was 
into a space some ten or twelve yards square  as the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground  and came running at the carriage  monsieur the
marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt 

 killed   shrieked the man  in wild desperation  extending both arms at
their length above his head  and staring at him   dead  

the people closed round  and looked at monsieur the marquis  there was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness  there was no visible menacing or anger  neither did the
people say anything  after the first cry  they had been silent  and they
remained so  the voice of the submissive man who had spoken  was flat
and tame in its extreme submission  monsieur the marquis ran his eyes
over them all  as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes 

he took out his purse 

 it is extraordinary to me   said he   that you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children  one or the other of you is for ever in
the way  how do i know what injury you have done my horses  see  give
him that  

he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up  and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell  the
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry   dead  

he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man  for whom the rest
made way  on seeing him  the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder 
sobbing and crying  and pointing to the fountain  where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle  and moving gently about it  they
were as silent  however  as the men 

 i know all  i know all   said the last comer   be a brave man  my
gaspard  it is better for the poor little plaything to die so  than to
live  it has died in a moment without pain  could it have lived an hour
as happily  

 you are a philosopher  you there   said the marquis  smiling   how do
they call you  

 they call me defarge  

 of what trade  

 monsieur the marquis  vendor of wine  

 pick up that  philosopher and vendor of wine   said the marquis 
throwing him another gold coin   and spend it as you will  the horses
there  are they right  

without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time  monsieur the
marquis leaned back in his seat  and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing  and had
paid for it  and could afford to pay for it  when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage  and ringing on its floor 

 hold   said monsieur the marquis   hold the horses  who threw that  

he looked to the spot where defarge the vendor of wine had stood  a
moment before  but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot  and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman  knitting 

 you dogs   said the marquis  but smoothly  and with an unchanged front 
except as to the spots on his nose   i would ride over any of you very
willingly  and exterminate you from the earth  if i knew which rascal
threw at the carriage  and if that brigand were sufficiently near it  he
should be crushed under the wheels  

so cowed was their condition  and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them  within the law and beyond it  that not
a voice  or a hand  or even an eye was raised  among the men  not one 
but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily  and looked the
marquis in the face  it was not for his dignity to notice it  his
contemptuous eyes passed over her  and over all the other rats  and he
leaned back in his seat again  and gave the word  go on  

he was driven on  and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession  the minister  the state projector  the farmer general  the
doctor  the lawyer  the ecclesiastic  the grand opera  the comedy  the
whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow  came whirling by  the rats
had crept out of their holes to look on  and they remained looking
on for hours  soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle  and making a barrier behind which they slunk  and through
which they peeped  the father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it  when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain  sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the fancy ball  when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous  knitting  still knitted on with the steadfastness
of fate  the water of the fountain ran  the swift river ran  the day ran
into evening  so much life in the city ran into death according to rule 
time and tide waited for no man  the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again  the fancy ball was lighted up at supper  all
things ran their course 




viii  monseigneur in the country


a beautiful landscape  with the corn bright in it  but not abundant 
patches of poor rye where corn should have been  patches of poor peas
and beans  patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat  on
inanimate nature  as on the men and women who cultivated it  a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly  a dejected
disposition to give up  and wither away 

monsieur the marquis in his travelling carriage  which might have been
lighter   conducted by four post horses and two postilions  fagged up
a steep hill  a blush on the countenance of monsieur the marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding  it was not from within  it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control  the setting
sun 

the sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill top  that its occupant was steeped in crimson   it will
die out   said monsieur the marquis  glancing at his hands   directly  

in effect  the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment  when the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel  and the carriage slid down
hill  with a cinderous smell  in a cloud of dust  the red glow departed
quickly  the sun and the marquis going down together  there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off 

but  there remained a broken country  bold and open  a little village
at the bottom of the hill  a broad sweep and rise beyond it  a
church tower  a windmill  a forest for the chase  and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison  round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on  the marquis looked  with the air of one who was
coming near home 

the village had its one poor street  with its poor brewery  poor
tannery  poor tavern  poor stable yard for relays of post horses  poor
fountain  all usual poor appointments  it had its poor people too  all
its people were poor  and many of them were sitting at their doors 
shredding spare onions and the like for supper  while many were at the
fountain  washing leaves  and grasses  and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten  expressive signs of what made them poor 
were not wanting  the tax for the state  the tax for the church  the tax
for the lord  tax local and tax general  were to be paid here and to be
paid there  according to solemn inscription in the little village  until
the wonder was  that there was any village left unswallowed 

few children were to be seen  and no dogs  as to the men and women 
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect  life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it  down in the little village under the mill 
or captivity and death in the dominant prison on the crag 

heralded by a courier in advance  and by the cracking of his postilions 
whips  which twined snake like about their heads in the evening air  as
if he came attended by the furies  monsieur the marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting house gate  it was hard by the
fountain  and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him 
he looked at them  and saw in them  without knowing it  the slow
sure filing down of misery worn face and figure  that was to make the
meagreness of frenchmen an english superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years 

monsieur the marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him  as the like of himself had drooped before
monseigneur of the court  only the difference was  that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate  when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group 

 bring me hither that fellow   said the marquis to the courier 

the fellow was brought  cap in hand  and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen  in the manner of the people at the paris fountain 

 i passed you on the road  

 monseigneur  it is true  i had the honour of being passed on the road  

 coming up the hill  and at the top of the hill  both  

 monseigneur  it is true  

 what did you look at  so fixedly  

 monseigneur  i looked at the man  

he stooped a little  and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage  all his fellows stooped to look under the carriage 

 what man  pig  and why look there  

 pardon  monseigneur  he swung by the chain of the shoe  the drag  

 who   demanded the traveller 

 monseigneur  the man  

 may the devil carry away these idiots  how do you call the man  you
know all the men of this part of the country  who was he  

 your clemency  monseigneur  he was not of this part of the country  of
all the days of my life  i never saw him  

 swinging by the chain  to be suffocated  

 with your gracious permission  that was the wonder of it  monseigneur 
his head hanging over  like this  

he turned himself sideways to the carriage  and leaned back  with his
face thrown up to the sky  and his head hanging down  then recovered
himself  fumbled with his cap  and made a bow 

 what was he like  

 monseigneur  he was whiter than the miller  all covered with dust 
white as a spectre  tall as a spectre  

the picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd  but all
eyes  without comparing notes with other eyes  looked at monsieur
the marquis  perhaps  to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience 

 truly  you did well   said the marquis  felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him   to see a thief accompanying my carriage 
and not open that great mouth of yours  bah  put him aside  monsieur
gabelle  

monsieur gabelle was the postmaster  and some other taxing functionary
united  he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination  and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner 

 bah  go aside   said monsieur gabelle 

 lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to night  and be sure that his business is honest  gabelle  

 monseigneur  i am flattered to devote myself to your orders  

 did he run away  fellow   where is that accursed  

the accursed was already under the carriage with some half dozen
particular friends  pointing out the chain with his blue cap  some
half dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out  and
presented him breathless to monsieur the marquis 

 did the man run away  dolt  when we stopped for the drag  

 monseigneur  he precipitated himself over the hill side  head first  as
a person plunges into the river  

 see to it  gabelle  go on  

the half dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels  like sheep  the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones  they had very little else to save  or
they might not have been so fortunate 

the burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond  was soon checked by the steepness of the hill  gradually 
it subsided to a foot pace  swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night  the postilions  with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the furies  quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips  the valet walked by the horses  the
courier was audible  trotting on ahead into the dull distance 

at the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial ground 
with a cross and a new large figure of our saviour on it  it was a poor
figure in wood  done by some inexperienced rustic carver  but he had
studied the figure from the life  his own life  maybe  for it was
dreadfully spare and thin 

to this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse  and was not at its worst  a woman was kneeling  she
turned her head as the carriage came up to her  rose quickly  and
presented herself at the carriage door 

 it is you  monseigneur  monseigneur  a petition  

with an exclamation of impatience  but with his unchangeable face 
monseigneur looked out 

 how  then  what is it  always petitions  

 monseigneur  for the love of the great god  my husband  the forester  

 what of your husband  the forester  always the same with you people  he
cannot pay something  

 he has paid all  monseigneur  he is dead  

 well  he is quiet  can i restore him to you  

 alas  no  monseigneur  but he lies yonder  under a little heap of poor
grass  

 well  

 monseigneur  there are so many little heaps of poor grass  

 again  well  

she looked an old woman  but was young  her manner was one of passionate
grief  by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy  and laid one of them on the carriage door  tenderly 
caressingly  as if it had been a human breast  and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch 

 monseigneur  hear me  monseigneur  hear my petition  my husband died of
want  so many die of want  so many more will die of want  

 again  well  can i feed them  

 monseigneur  the good god knows  but i don   ask it  my petition is 
that a morsel of stone or wood  with my husband   name  may be placed
over him to show where he lies  otherwise  the place will be quickly
forgotten  it will never be found when i am dead of the same malady  i
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass  monseigneur  they
are so many  they increase so fast  there is so much want  monseigneur 
monseigneur  

the valet had put her away from the door  the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot  the postilions had quickened the pace  she was left far
behind  and monseigneur  again escorted by the furies  was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau 

the sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him  and rose  as
the rain falls  impartially  on the dusty  ragged  and toil worn group
at the fountain not far away  to whom the mender of roads  with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing  still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre  as long as they could bear it  by degrees  as they
could bear no more  they dropped off one by one  and lights twinkled
in little casements  which lights  as the casements darkened  and more
stars came out  seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished 

the shadow of a large high roofed house  and of many over hanging trees 
was upon monsieur the marquis by that time  and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau  as his carriage stopped  and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him 

 monsieur charles  whom i expect  is he arrived from england  

 monseigneur  not yet  




ix  the gorgon   head


it was a heavy mass of building  that chateau of monsieur the marquis 
with a large stone courtyard before it  and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door  a stony
business altogether  with heavy stone balustrades  and stone urns  and
stone flowers  and stone faces of men  and stone heads of lions  in
all directions  as if the gorgon   head had surveyed it  when it was
finished  two centuries ago 

up the broad flight of shallow steps  monsieur the marquis  flambeau
preceded  went from his carriage  sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees  all else was so quiet  that the
flambeau carried up the steps  and the other flambeau held at the great
door  burnt as if they were in a close room of state  instead of being
in the open night air  other sound than the owl   voice there was none 
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin  for  it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together  and then
heave a long low sigh  and hold their breath again 

the great door clanged behind him  and monsieur the marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar spears  swords  and knives of the chase 
grimmer with certain heavy riding rods and riding whips  of which many a
peasant  gone to his benefactor death  had felt the weight when his lord
was angry 

avoiding the larger rooms  which were dark and made fast for the night 
monsieur the marquis  with his flambeau bearer going on before  went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor  this thrown open  admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms  his bed chamber and two
others  high vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors  great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time  and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country 
the fashion of the last louis but one  of the line that was never to
break  the fourteenth louis  was conspicuous in their rich furniture 
but  it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of france 

a supper table was laid for two  in the third of the rooms  a round
room  in one of the chateau   four extinguisher topped towers  a small
lofty room  with its window wide open  and the wooden jalousie blinds
closed  so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black  alternating with their broad lines of stone colour 

 my nephew   said the marquis  glancing at the supper preparation   they
said he was not arrived  

nor was he  but  he had been expected with monseigneur 

 ah  it is not probable he will arrive to night  nevertheless  leave the
table as it is  i shall be ready in a quarter of an hour  

in a quarter of an hour monseigneur was ready  and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper  his chair was opposite to the window  and
he had taken his soup  and was raising his glass of bordeaux to his
lips  when he put it down 

 what is that   he calmly asked  looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour 

 monseigneur  that  

 outside the blinds  open the blinds  

it was done 

 well  

 monseigneur  it is nothing  the trees and the night are all that are
here  

the servant who spoke  had thrown the blinds wide  had looked out into
the vacant darkness  and stood with that blank behind him  looking round
for instructions 

 good   said the imperturbable master   close them again  

that was done too  and the marquis went on with his supper  he was
half way through it  when he again stopped with his glass in his hand 
hearing the sound of wheels  it came on briskly  and came up to the
front of the chateau 

 ask who is arrived  

it was the nephew of monseigneur  he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur  early in the afternoon  he had diminished the distance
rapidly  but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road 
he had heard of monseigneur  at the posting houses  as being before him 

he was to be told  said monseigneur  that supper awaited him then and
there  and that he was prayed to come to it  in a little while he came 
he had been known in england as charles darnay 

monseigneur received him in a courtly manner  but they did not shake
hands 

 you left paris yesterday  sir   he said to monseigneur  as he took his
seat at table 

 yesterday  and you  

 i come direct  

 from london  

 yes  

 you have been a long time coming   said the marquis  with a smile 

 on the contrary  i come direct  

 pardon me  i mean  not a long time on the journey  a long time
intending the journey  

 i have been detained by   the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer   various business  

 without doubt   said the polished uncle 

so long as a servant was present  no other words passed between them 
when coffee had been served and they were alone together  the nephew 
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask  opened a conversation 

 i have come back  sir  as you anticipate  pursuing the object that
took me away  it carried me into great and unexpected peril  but it is
a sacred object  and if it had carried me to death i hope it would have
sustained me  

 not to death   said the uncle   it is not necessary to say  to death  

 i doubt  sir   returned the nephew   whether  if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death  you would have cared to stop me there  

the deepened marks in the nose  and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face  looked ominous as to that  the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest  which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring 

 indeed  sir   pursued the nephew   for anything i know  you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me  

 no  no  no   said the uncle  pleasantly 

 but  however that may be   resumed the nephew  glancing at him with
deep distrust   i know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means 
and would know no scruple as to means  

 my friend  i told you so   said the uncle  with a fine pulsation in the
two marks   do me the favour to recall that i told you so  long ago  

 i recall it  

 thank you   said the marquis  very sweetly indeed 

his tone lingered in the air  almost like the tone of a musical
instrument 

 in effect  sir   pursued the nephew   i believe it to be at once your
bad fortune  and my good fortune  that has kept me out of a prison in
france here  

 i do not quite understand   returned the uncle  sipping his coffee 
 dare i ask you to explain  

 i believe that if you were not in disgrace with the court  and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past  a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely  

 it is possible   said the uncle  with great calmness   for the honour
of the family  i could even resolve to incommode you to that extent 
pray excuse me  

 i perceive that  happily for me  the reception of the day before
yesterday was  as usual  a cold one   observed the nephew 

 i would not say happily  my friend   returned the uncle  with refined
politeness   i would not be sure of that  a good opportunity for
consideration  surrounded by the advantages of solitude  might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself  but it is useless to discuss the question  i am  as you say 
at a disadvantage  these little instruments of correction  these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families  these slight favours that
might so incommode you  are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity  they are sought by so many  and they are granted
 comparatively  to so few  it used not to be so  but france in all such
things is changed for the worse  our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar  from this room  many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged  in the next room  my bedroom  
one fellow  to our knowledge  was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter   his  daughter  we have
lost many privileges  a new philosophy has become the mode  and the
assertion of our station  in these days  might  i do not go so far as
to say would  but might  cause us real inconvenience  all very bad  very
bad  

the marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff  and shook his head 
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself  that great means of regeneration 

 we have so asserted our station  both in the old time and in the modern
time also   said the nephew  gloomily   that i believe our name to be
more detested than any name in france  

 let us hope so   said the uncle   detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low  

 there is not   pursued the nephew  in his former tone   a face i can
look at  in all this country round about us  which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery  

 a compliment   said the marquis   to the grandeur of the family 
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur 
hah   and he took another gentle little pinch of snuff  and lightly
crossed his legs 

but  when his nephew  leaning an elbow on the table  covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand  the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness  closeness 
and dislike  than was comportable with its wearer   assumption of
indifference 

 repression is the only lasting philosophy  the dark deference of fear
and slavery  my friend   observed the marquis   will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip  as long as this roof   looking up to it   shuts
out the sky  

that might not be so long as the marquis supposed  if a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence  and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence  could have been shown to
him that night  he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly  fire charred  plunder wrecked rains  as for the roof
he vaunted  he might have found  that  shutting out the sky in a new
way  to wit  for ever  from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired  out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets 

 meanwhile   said the marquis   i will preserve the honour and repose
of the family  if you will not  but you must be fatigued  shall we
terminate our conference for the night  

 a moment more  

 an hour  if you please  

 sir   said the nephew   we have done wrong  and are reaping the fruits
of wrong  

  we  have done wrong   repeated the marquis  with an inquiring smile 
and delicately pointing  first to his nephew  then to himself 

 our family  our honourable family  whose honour is of so much account
to both of us  in such different ways  even in my father   time  we did
a world of wrong  injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure  whatever it was  why need i speak of my father   time 
when it is equally yours  can i separate my father   twin brother  joint
inheritor  and next successor  from himself  

 death has done that   said the marquis 

 and has left me   answered the nephew   bound to a system that is
frightful to me  responsible for it  but powerless in it  seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother   lips  and obey the last
look of my dear mother   eyes  which implored me to have mercy and to
redress  and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain  

 seeking them from me  my nephew   said the marquis  touching him on the
breast with his forefinger  they were now standing by the hearth   you
will for ever seek them in vain  be assured  

every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face  was
cruelly  craftily  and closely compressed  while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew  with his snuff box in his hand  once again he
touched him on the breast  as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword  with which  in delicate finesse  he ran him through the
body  and said 

 my friend  i will die  perpetuating the system under which i have
lived  

when he had said it  he took a culminating pinch of snuff  and put his
box in his pocket 

 better to be a rational creature   he added then  after ringing a small
bell on the table   and accept your natural destiny  but you are lost 
monsieur charles  i see  

 this property and france are lost to me   said the nephew  sadly   i
renounce them  

 are they both yours to renounce  france may be  but is the property  it
is scarcely worth mentioning  but  is it yet  

 i had no intention  in the words i used  to claim it yet  if it passed
to me from you  to morrow   

 which i have the vanity to hope is not probable  

   or twenty years hence   

 you do me too much honour   said the marquis   still  i prefer that
supposition  

   i would abandon it  and live otherwise and elsewhere  it is little to
relinquish  what is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin  

 hah   said the marquis  glancing round the luxurious room 

 to the eye it is fair enough  here  but seen in its integrity 
under the sky  and by the daylight  it is a crumbling tower of waste 
mismanagement  extortion  debt  mortgage  oppression  hunger  nakedness 
and suffering  

 hah   said the marquis again  in a well satisfied manner 

 if it ever becomes mine  it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly  if such a thing is possible  from the
weight that drags it down  so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance  may  in
another generation  suffer less  but it is not for me  there is a curse
on it  and on all this land  

 and you   said the uncle   forgive my curiosity  do you  under your new
philosophy  graciously intend to live  

 i must do  to live  what others of my countrymen  even with nobility at
their backs  may have to do some day  work  

 in england  for example  

 yes  the family honour  sir  is safe from me in this country  the
family name can suffer from me in no other  for i bear it in no other  

the ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed chamber to be
lighted  it now shone brightly  through the door of communication  the
marquis looked that way  and listened for the retreating step of his
valet 

 england is very attractive to you  seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there   he observed then  turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile 

 i have already said  that for my prospering there  i am sensible i may
be indebted to you  sir  for the rest  it is my refuge  

 they say  those boastful english  that it is the refuge of many  you
know a compatriot who has found a refuge there  a doctor  

 yes  

 with a daughter  

 yes  

 yes   said the marquis   you are fatigued  good night  

as he bent his head in his most courtly manner  there was a secrecy
in his smiling face  and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words 
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly  at the same
time  the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes  and the thin
straight lips  and the markings in the nose  curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic 

 yes   repeated the marquis   a doctor with a daughter  yes  so
commences the new philosophy  you are fatigued  good night  

it would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his  the nephew
looked at him  in vain  in passing on to the door 

 good night   said the uncle   i look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning  good repose  light monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there   and burn monsieur my nephew in his bed  if you will   he
added to himself  before he rang his little bell again  and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom 

the valet come and gone  monsieur the marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber robe  to prepare himself gently for sleep  that hot still
night  rustling about the room  his softly slippered feet making no
noise on the floor  he moved like a refined tiger   looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort  in story  whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off  or just
coming on 

he moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom  looking again at the
scraps of the day   journey that came unbidden into his mind  the slow
toil up the hill at sunset  the setting sun  the descent  the mill  the
prison on the crag  the little village in the hollow  the peasants at
the fountain  and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage  that fountain suggested the paris fountain 
the little bundle lying on the step  the women bending over it  and the
tall man with his arms up  crying   dead  

 i am cool now   said monsieur the marquis   and may go to bed  

so  leaving only one light burning on the large hearth  he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him  and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep 

the stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours  for three heavy hours  the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks  the dogs barked  and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men poets  but it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them 

for three heavy hours  the stone faces of the chateau  lion and human 
stared blindly at the night  dead darkness lay on all the landscape 
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads 
the burial place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another  the figure on the cross might
have come down  for anything that could be seen of it  in the village 
taxers and taxed were fast asleep  dreaming  perhaps  of banquets  as
the starved usually do  and of ease and rest  as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may  its lean inhabitants slept soundly  and were fed and
freed 

the fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard  and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard  both melting away  like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of time  through three dark
hours  then  the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light 
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened 

lighter and lighter  until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees  and poured its radiance over the hill  in the glow  the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood  and the stone faces
crimsoned  the carol of the birds was loud and high  and  on the
weather beaten sill of the great window of the bed chamber of monsieur
the marquis  one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might 
at this  the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed  and  with open
mouth and dropped under jaw  looked awe stricken 

now  the sun was full up  and movement began in the village  casement
windows opened  crazy doors were unbarred  and people came forth
shivering  chilled  as yet  by the new sweet air  then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population  some  to the
fountain  some  to the fields  men and women here  to dig and delve  men
and women there  to see to the poor live stock  and lead the bony cows
out  to such pasture as could be found by the roadside  in the church
and at the cross  a kneeling figure or two  attendant on the latter
prayers  the led cow  trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot 

the chateau awoke later  as became its quality  but awoke gradually and
surely  first  the lonely boar spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old  then  had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine 
now  doors and windows were thrown open  horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways  leaves sparkled and rustled at iron grated windows  dogs
pulled hard at their chains  and reared impatient to be loosed 

all these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life  and the
return of morning  surely  not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau  nor the running up and down the stairs  nor the hurried
figures on the terrace  nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere  nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away 

what winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads  already
at work on the hill top beyond the village  with his day   dinner  not
much to carry  lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow   while to
peck at  on a heap of stones  had the birds  carrying some grains of it
to a distance  dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds  whether or
no  the mender of roads ran  on the sultry morning  as if for his life 
down the hill  knee high in dust  and never stopped till he got to the
fountain 

all the people of the village were at the fountain  standing about
in their depressed manner  and whispering low  but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise  the led cows  hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them  were looking stupidly
on  or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble  which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter  some of
the people of the chateau  and some of those of the posting house  and
all the taxing authorities  were armed more or less  and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way  that was
highly fraught with nothing  already  the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends  and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap  what did all this portend 
and what portended the swift hoisting up of monsieur gabelle behind
a servant on horseback  and the conveying away of the said gabelle
 double laden though the horse was   at a gallop  like a new version of
the german ballad of leonora 

it portended that there was one stone face too many  up at the chateau 

the gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night  and had added
the one stone face wanting  the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years 

it lay back on the pillow of monsieur the marquis  it was like a fine
mask  suddenly startled  made angry  and petrified  driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it  was a knife  round its hilt
was a frill of paper  on which was scrawled 

 drive him fast to his tomb  this  from jacques  




   two promises


more months  to the number of twelve  had come and gone  and mr  charles
darnay was established in england as a higher teacher of the french
language who was conversant with french literature  in this age  he
would have been a professor  in that age  he was a tutor  he read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world  and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy  he could write of them  besides  in
sound english  and render them into sound english  such masters were not
at that time easily found  princes that had been  and kings that were
to be  were not yet of the teacher class  and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of tellson   ledgers  to turn cooks and carpenters  as a
tutor  whose attainments made the student   way unusually pleasant and
profitable  and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge  young mr  darnay soon became
known and encouraged  he was well acquainted  more over  with the
circumstances of his country  and those were of ever growing interest 
so  with great perseverance and untiring industry  he prospered 

in london  he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold  nor
to lie on beds of roses  if he had had any such exalted expectation  he
would not have prospered  he had expected labour  and he found it  and
did it and made the best of it  in this  his prosperity consisted 

a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge  where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in european languages  instead of conveying greek
and latin through the custom house  the rest of his time he passed in
london 

now  from the days when it was always summer in eden  to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes  the world of a man has
invariably gone one way  charles darnay   way  the way of the love of a
woman 

he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger  he had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice 
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful  as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him  but  he had not yet spoken to her on the subject  the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long 
long  dusty roads  the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream  had been done a year  and he had never yet  by so
much as a single spoken word  disclosed to her the state of his heart 

that he had his reasons for this  he knew full well  it was again a
summer day when  lately arrived in london from his college occupation 
he turned into the quiet corner in soho  bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to doctor manette  it was the close of the summer
day  and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross 

he found the doctor reading in his arm chair at a window  the energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness  had been gradually restored to him  he was now a
very energetic man indeed  with great firmness of purpose  strength
of resolution  and vigour of action  in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden  as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties  but  this had never been
frequently observable  and had grown more and more rare 

he studied much  slept little  sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease  and was equably cheerful  to him  now entered charles darnay  at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand 

 charles darnay  i rejoice to see you  we have been counting on your
return these three or four days past  mr  stryver and sydney carton were
both here yesterday  and both made you out to be more than due  

 i am obliged to them for their interest in the matter   he answered 
a little coldly as to them  though very warmly as to the doctor   miss
manette   

 is well   said the doctor  as he stopped short   and your return will
delight us all  she has gone out on some household matters  but will
soon be home  

 doctor manette  i knew she was from home  i took the opportunity of her
being from home  to beg to speak to you  

there was a blank silence 

 yes   said the doctor  with evident constraint   bring your chair here 
and speak on  

he complied as to the chair  but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy 

 i have had the happiness  doctor manette  of being so intimate here  
so he at length began   for some year and a half  that i hope the topic
on which i am about to touch may not   

he was stayed by the doctor   putting out his hand to stop him  when he
had kept it so a little while  he said  drawing it back 

 is lucie the topic  

 she is  

 it is hard for me to speak of her at any time  it is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours  charles darnay  

 it is a tone of fervent admiration  true homage  and deep love  doctor
manette   he said deferentially 

there was another blank silence before her father rejoined 

 i believe it  i do you justice  i believe it  

his constraint was so manifest  and it was so manifest  too  that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject  that charles
darnay hesitated 

 shall i go on  sir  

another blank 

 yes  go on  

 you anticipate what i would say  though you cannot know how earnestly
i say it  how earnestly i feel it  without knowing my secret heart  and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden  dear doctor manette  i love your daughter fondly  dearly 
disinterestedly  devotedly  if ever there were love in the world  i love
her  you have loved yourself  let your old love speak for me  

the doctor sat with his face turned away  and his eyes bent on the
ground  at the last words  he stretched out his hand again  hurriedly 
and cried 

 not that  sir  let that be  i adjure you  do not recall that  

his cry was so like a cry of actual pain  that it rang in charles
darnay   ears long after he had ceased  he motioned with the hand he had
extended  and it seemed to be an appeal to darnay to pause  the latter
so received it  and remained silent 

 i ask your pardon   said the doctor  in a subdued tone  after some
moments   i do not doubt your loving lucie  you may be satisfied of it  

he turned towards him in his chair  but did not look at him  or
raise his eyes  his chin dropped upon his hand  and his white hair
overshadowed his face 

 have you spoken to lucie  

 no  

 nor written  

 never  

 it would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father  her father thanks
you  

he offered his hand  but his eyes did not go with it 

 i know   said darnay  respectfully   how can i fail to know  doctor
manette  i who have seen you together from day to day  that between
you and miss manette there is an affection so unusual  so touching  so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured  that it
can have few parallels  even in the tenderness between a father and
child  i know  doctor manette  how can i fail to know  that  mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman  there
is  in her heart  towards you  all the love and reliance of infancy
itself  i know that  as in her childhood she had no parent  so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character  united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her  i know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life  you could
hardly be invested  in her sight  with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her  i know that when she is clinging to
you  the hands of baby  girl  and woman  all in one  are round your
neck  i know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age  sees and loves you at my age  loves her mother broken hearted 
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration  i
have known this  night and day  since i have known you in your home  

her father sat silent  with his face bent down  his breathing was a
little quickened  but he repressed all other signs of agitation 

 dear doctor manette  always knowing this  always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you  i have forborne  and forborne  as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it  i have felt  and do even
now feel  that to bring my love  even mine  between you  is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself  but i love her 
heaven is my witness that i love her  

 i believe it   answered her father  mournfully   i have thought so
before now  i believe it  

 but  do not believe   said darnay  upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound   that if my fortune were so cast as
that  being one day so happy as to make her my wife  i must at any time
put any separation between her and you  i could or would breathe a
word of what i now say  besides that i should know it to be hopeless  i
should know it to be a baseness  if i had any such possibility  even at
a remote distance of years  harboured in my thoughts  and hidden in my
heart  if it ever had been there  if it ever could be there  i could not
now touch this honoured hand  

he laid his own upon it as he spoke 

 no  dear doctor manette  like you  a voluntary exile from france  like
you  driven from it by its distractions  oppressions  and miseries  like
you  striving to live away from it by my own exertions  and trusting
in a happier future  i look only to sharing your fortunes  sharing your
life and home  and being faithful to you to the death  not to divide
with lucie her privilege as your child  companion  and friend  but to
come in aid of it  and bind her closer to you  if such a thing can be  

his touch still lingered on her father   hand  answering the touch for a
moment  but not coldly  her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair  and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference  a struggle was evidently in his face  a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread 

 you speak so feelingly and so manfully  charles darnay  that i thank
you with all my heart  and will open all my heart  or nearly so  have
you any reason to believe that lucie loves you  

 none  as yet  none  

 is it the immediate object of this confidence  that you may at once
ascertain that  with my knowledge  

 not even so  i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks  i
might  mistaken or not mistaken  have that hopefulness to morrow  

 do you seek any guidance from me  

 i ask none  sir  but i have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power  if you should deem it right  to give me some  

 do you seek any promise from me  

 i do seek that  

 what is it  

 i well understand that  without you  i could have no hope  i well
understand that  even if miss manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart  do not think i have the presumption to assume so much  i
could retain no place in it against her love for her father  

 if that be so  do you see what  on the other hand  is involved in it  

 i understand equally well  that a word from her father in any suitor  
favour  would outweigh herself and all the world  for which reason 
doctor manette   said darnay  modestly but firmly   i would not ask that
word  to save my life  

 i am sure of it  charles darnay  mysteries arise out of close love  as
well as out of wide division  in the former case  they are subtle and
delicate  and difficult to penetrate  my daughter lucie is  in this one
respect  such a mystery to me  i can make no guess at the state of her
heart  

 may i ask  sir  if you think she is    as he hesitated  her father
supplied the rest 

 is sought by any other suitor  

 it is what i meant to say  

her father considered a little before he answered 

 you have seen mr  carton here  yourself  mr  stryver is here too 
occasionally  if it be at all  it can only be by one of these  

 or both   said darnay 

 i had not thought of both  i should not think either  likely  you want
a promise from me  tell me what it is  

 it is  that if miss manette should bring to you at any time  on her own
part  such a confidence as i have ventured to lay before you  you will
bear testimony to what i have said  and to your belief in it  i hope you
may be able to think so well of me  as to urge no influence against
me  i say nothing more of my stake in this  this is what i ask  the
condition on which i ask it  and which you have an undoubted right to
require  i will observe immediately  

 i give the promise   said the doctor   without any condition  i believe
your object to be  purely and truthfully  as you have stated it  i
believe your intention is to perpetuate  and not to weaken  the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self  if she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness  i will give her to you 
if there were  charles darnay  if there were   

the young man had taken his hand gratefully  their hands were joined as
the doctor spoke 

   any fancies  any reasons  any apprehensions  anything whatsoever 
new or old  against the man she really loved  the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head  they should all be obliterated for her
sake  she is everything to me  more to me than suffering  more to me
than wrong  more to me  well  this is idle talk  

so strange was the way in which he faded into silence  and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak  that darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it 

 you said something to me   said doctor manette  breaking into a smile 
 what was it you said to me  

he was at a loss how to answer  until he remembered having spoken of a
condition  relieved as his mind reverted to that  he answered 

 your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part  my present name  though but slightly changed from my mother    is
not  as you will remember  my own  i wish to tell you what that is  and
why i am in england  

 stop   said the doctor of beauvais 

 i wish it  that i may the better deserve your confidence  and have no
secret from you  

 stop  

for an instant  the doctor even had his two hands at his ears  for
another instant  even had his two hands laid on darnay   lips 

 tell me when i ask you  not now  if your suit should prosper  if lucie
should love you  you shall tell me on your marriage morning  do you
promise  

 willingly 

 give me your hand  she will be home directly  and it is better she
should not see us together to night  go  god bless you  

it was dark when charles darnay left him  and it was an hour later and
darker when lucie came home  she hurried into the room alone  for
miss pross had gone straight up stairs  and was surprised to find his
reading chair empty 

 my father   she called to him   father dear  

nothing was said in answer  but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom  passing lightly across the intermediate room  she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened  crying to herself  with her
blood all chilled   what shall i do  what shall i do  

her uncertainty lasted but a moment  she hurried back  and tapped at
his door  and softly called to him  the noise ceased at the sound of
her voice  and he presently came out to her  and they walked up and down
together for a long time 

she came down from her bed  to look at him in his sleep that night  he
slept heavily  and his tray of shoemaking tools  and his old unfinished
work  were all as usual 




xi  a companion picture


 sydney   said mr  stryver  on that self same night  or morning  to his
jackal   mix another bowl of punch  i have something to say to you  

sydney had been working double tides that night  and the night before 
and the night before that  and a good many nights in succession  making
a grand clearance among mr  stryver   papers before the setting in
of the long vacation  the clearance was effected at last  the stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up  everything was got rid of until
november should come with its fogs atmospheric  and fogs legal  and
bring grist to the mill again 

sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application  it had taken a deal of extra wet towelling to pull him
through the night  a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling  and he was in a very damaged condition  as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours 

 are you mixing that other bowl of punch   said stryver the portly  with
his hands in his waistband  glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back 

 i am  

 now  look here  i am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you  and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me  i intend to marry  

  do  you  

 yes  and not for money  what do you say now  

 i don   feel disposed to say much  who is she  

 guess  

 do i know her  

 guess  

 i am not going to guess  at five o clock in the morning  with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head  if you want me to guess  you must ask
me to dinner  

 well then  i ll tell you   said stryver  coming slowly into a sitting
posture   sydney  i rather despair of making myself intelligible to you 
because you are such an insensible dog  

 and you   returned sydney  busy concocting the punch   are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit   

 come   rejoined stryver  laughing boastfully   though i don   prefer
any claim to being the soul of romance  for i hope i know better   still
i am a tenderer sort of fellow than  you   

 you are a luckier  if you mean that  

 i don   mean that  i mean i am a man of more  more   

 say gallantry  while you are about it   suggested carton 

 well  i ll say gallantry  my meaning is that i am a man   said stryver 
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch   who cares more to
be agreeable  who takes more pains to be agreeable  who knows better how
to be agreeable  in a woman   society  than you do  

 go on   said sydney carton 

 no  but before i go on   said stryver  shaking his head in his bullying
way   i ll have this out with you  you ve been at doctor manette   house
as much as i have  or more than i have  why  i have been ashamed of your
moroseness there  your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind  that  upon my life and soul  i have been ashamed of you 
sydney  

 it should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar  to
be ashamed of anything   returned sydney   you ought to be much obliged
to me  

 you shall not get off in that way   rejoined stryver  shouldering the
rejoinder at him   no  sydney  it   my duty to tell you  and i tell you
to your face to do you good  that you are a devilish ill conditioned
fellow in that sort of society  you are a disagreeable fellow  

sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made  and laughed 

 look at me   said stryver  squaring himself   i have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have  being more independent in circumstances 
why do i do it  

 i never saw you do it yet   muttered carton 

 i do it because it   politic  i do it on principle  and look at me  i
get on  

 you don   get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions  
answered carton  with a careless air   i wish you would keep to that  as
to me  will you never understand that i am incorrigible  

he asked the question with some appearance of scorn 

 you have no business to be incorrigible   was his friend   answer 
delivered in no very soothing tone 

 i have no business to be  at all  that i know of   said sydney carton 
 who is the lady  

 now  don   let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable 
sydney   said mr  stryver  preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make   because i know you don   mean
half you say  and if you meant it all  it would be of no importance  i
make this little preface  because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms  

 i did  

 certainly  and in these chambers  

sydney carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend 
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend 

 you made mention of the young lady as a golden haired doll  the young
lady is miss manette  if you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way  sydney  i might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation  but you are not 
you want that sense altogether  therefore i am no more annoyed when i
think of the expression  than i should be annoyed by a man   opinion of
a picture of mine  who had no eye for pictures  or of a piece of music
of mine  who had no ear for music  

sydney carton drank the punch at a great rate  drank it by bumpers 
looking at his friend 

 now you know all about it  syd   said mr  stryver   i don   care about
fortune  she is a charming creature  and i have made up my mind to
please myself  on the whole  i think i can afford to please myself  she
will have in me a man already pretty well off  and a rapidly rising man 
and a man of some distinction  it is a piece of good fortune for her 
but she is worthy of good fortune  are you astonished  

carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i be
astonished  

 you approve  

carton  still drinking the punch  rejoined   why should i not approve  

 well   said his friend stryver   you take it more easily than i fancied
you would  and are less mercenary on my behalf than i thought you would
be  though  to be sure  you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will  yes  sydney  i have had
enough of this style of life  with no other as a change from it  i
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it  when he doesn    he can stay away   and i feel
that miss manette will tell well in any station  and will always do me
credit  so i have made up my mind  and now  sydney  old boy  i want to
say a word to  you  about  your  prospects  you are in a bad way  you
know  you really are in a bad way  you don   know the value of money 
you live hard  you ll knock up one of these days  and be ill and poor 
you really ought to think about a nurse  

the prosperous patronage with which he said it  made him look twice as
big as he was  and four times as offensive 

 now  let me recommend you   pursued stryver   to look it in the face 
i have looked it in the face  in my different way  look it in the face 
you  in your different way  marry  provide somebody to take care of
you  never mind your having no enjoyment of women   society  nor
understanding of it  nor tact for it  find out somebody  find out some
respectable woman with a little property  somebody in the landlady way 
or lodging letting way  and marry her  against a rainy day  that   the
kind of thing for  you   now think of it  sydney  

 i ll think of it   said sydney 




xii  the fellow of delicacy


mr  stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the doctor   daughter  resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the long vacation  after some mental
debating of the point  he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with  and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before michaelmas term  or in the little christmas vacation between it
and hilary 

as to the strength of his case  he had not a doubt about it  but clearly
saw his way to the verdict  argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds  the only grounds ever worth taking into account  it was a
plain case  and had not a weak spot in it  he called himself for the
plaintiff  there was no getting over his evidence  the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief  and the jury did not even turn to
consider  after trying it  stryver         was satisfied that no plainer
case could be 

accordingly  mr  stryver inaugurated the long vacation with a formal
proposal to take miss manette to vauxhall gardens  that failing  to
ranelagh  that unaccountably failing too  it behoved him to present
himself in soho  and there declare his noble mind 

towards soho  therefore  mr  stryver shouldered his way from the temple 
while the bloom of the long vacation   infancy was still upon it 
anybody who had seen him projecting himself into soho while he was yet
on saint dunstan   side of temple bar  bursting in his full blown way
along the pavement  to the jostlement of all weaker people  might have
seen how safe and strong he was 

his way taking him past tellson    and he both banking at tellson   and
knowing mr  lorry as the intimate friend of the manettes  it entered mr 
stryver   mind to enter the bank  and reveal to mr  lorry the brightness
of the soho horizon  so  he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat  stumbled down the two steps  got past the two ancient
cashiers  and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where mr 
lorry sat at great books ruled for figures  with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too  and everything
under the clouds were a sum 

 halloa   said mr  stryver   how do you do  i hope you are well  

it was stryver   grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place  or space  he was so much too big for tellson    that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance  as though he
squeezed them against the wall  the house itself  magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far off perspective  lowered displeased  as if
the stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat 

the discreet mr  lorry said  in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances   how do you do  mr  stryver  how do
you do  sir   and shook hands  there was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands  always to be seen in any clerk at tellson   who shook
hands with a customer when the house pervaded the air  he shook in a
self abnegating way  as one who shook for tellson and co 

 can i do anything for you  mr  stryver   asked mr  lorry  in his
business character 

 why  no  thank you  this is a private visit to yourself  mr  lorry  i
have come for a private word  

 oh indeed   said mr  lorry  bending down his ear  while his eye strayed
to the house afar off 

 i am going   said mr  stryver  leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk  whereupon  although it was a large double one  there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him   i am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend  miss manette  mr  lorry  

 oh dear me   cried mr  lorry  rubbing his chin  and looking at his
visitor dubiously 

 oh dear me  sir   repeated stryver  drawing back   oh dear you  sir 
what may your meaning be  mr  lorry  

 my meaning   answered the man of business   is  of course  friendly and
appreciative  and that it does you the greatest credit  and  in short 
my meaning is everything you could desire  but  really  you know  mr 
stryver    mr  lorry paused  and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner  as if he were compelled against his will to add  internally 
 you know there really is so much too much of you  

 well   said stryver  slapping the desk with his contentious hand 
opening his eyes wider  and taking a long breath   if i understand you 
mr  lorry  i ll be hanged  

mr  lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end  and bit the feather of a pen 

      it all  sir   said stryver  staring at him   am i not eligible  

 oh dear yes  yes  oh yes  you re eligible   said mr  lorry   if you say
eligible  you are eligible  

 am i not prosperous   asked stryver 

 oh  if you come to prosperous  you are prosperous   said mr  lorry 

 and advancing  

 if you come to advancing you know   said mr  lorry  delighted to be
able to make another admission   nobody can doubt that  

 then what on earth is your meaning  mr  lorry   demanded stryver 
perceptibly crestfallen 

 well  i  were you going there now   asked mr  lorry 

 straight   said stryver  with a plump of his fist on the desk 

 then i think i wouldn    if i was you  

 why   said stryver   now  i ll put you in a corner   forensically
shaking a forefinger at him   you are a man of business and bound to
have a reason  state your reason  why wouldn   you go  

 because   said mr  lorry   i wouldn   go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that i should succeed  

       me    cried stryver   but this beats everything  

mr  lorry glanced at the distant house  and glanced at the angry
stryver 

 here   a man of business  a man of years  a man of experience   in 
a bank   said stryver   and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success  he says there   no reason at all  says it with his
head on   mr  stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off 

 when i speak of success  i speak of success with the young lady  and
when i speak of causes and reasons to make success probable  i speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady  the young
lady  my good sir   said mr  lorry  mildly tapping the stryver arm   the
young lady  the young lady goes before all  

 then you mean to tell me  mr  lorry   said stryver  squaring his
elbows   that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing fool  

 not exactly so  i mean to tell you  mr  stryver   said mr  lorry 
reddening   that i will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips  and that if i knew any man  which i hope i do not  whose
taste was so coarse  and whose temper was so overbearing  that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk  not even tellson   should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind  

the necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put mr  stryver  
blood vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry 
mr  lorry   veins  methodical as their courses could usually be  were in
no better state now it was his turn 

 that is what i mean to tell you  sir   said mr  lorry   pray let there
be no mistake about it  

mr  stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while  and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it  which probably gave him the
toothache  he broke the awkward silence by saying 

 this is something new to me  mr  lorry  you deliberately advise me not
to go up to soho and offer myself   my self  stryver of the king   bench
bar  

 do you ask me for my advice  mr  stryver  

 yes  i do  

 very good  then i give it  and you have repeated it correctly  

 and all i can say of it is   laughed stryver with a vexed laugh   that
this  ha  ha   beats everything past  present  and to come  

 now understand me   pursued mr  lorry   as a man of business  i am
not justified in saying anything about this matter  for  as a man of
business  i know nothing of it  but  as an old fellow  who has carried
miss manette in his arms  who is the trusted friend of miss manette and
of her father too  and who has a great affection for them both  i have
spoken  the confidence is not of my seeking  recollect  now  you think i
may not be right  

 not i   said stryver  whistling   i can   undertake to find third
parties in common sense  i can only find it for myself  i suppose sense
in certain quarters  you suppose mincing bread and butter nonsense  it  
new to me  but you are right  i dare say  

 what i suppose  mr  stryver  i claim to characterise for myself  and
understand me  sir   said mr  lorry  quickly flushing again   i
will not  not even at tellson    have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing  

 there  i beg your pardon   said stryver 

 granted  thank you  well  mr  stryver  i was about to say   it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken  it might be painful to doctor
manette to have the task of being explicit with you  it might be very
painful to miss manette to have the task of being explicit with you  you
know the terms upon which i have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family  if you please  committing you in no way  representing you
in no way  i will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it  if you should then be dissatisfied with it  you can but test its
soundness for yourself  if  on the other hand  you should be satisfied
with it  and it should be what it now is  it may spare all sides what is
best spared  what do you say  

 how long would you keep me in town  

 oh  it is only a question of a few hours  i could go to soho in the
evening  and come to your chambers afterwards  

 then i say yes   said stryver   i won   go up there now  i am not so
hot upon it as that comes to  i say yes  and i shall expect you to look
in to night  good morning  

then mr  stryver turned and burst out of the bank  causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through  that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters  required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks  those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing  and were popularly
believed  when they had bowed a customer out  still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in 

the barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty  unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow  he got it down   and now   said mr  stryver  shaking his
forensic forefinger at the temple in general  when it was down   my way
out of this  is  to put you all in the wrong  

it was a bit of the art of an old bailey tactician  in which he found
great relief   you shall not put me in the wrong  young lady   said mr 
stryver   i ll do that for you  

accordingly  when mr  lorry called that night as late as ten o clock 
mr  stryver  among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose  seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning  he even showed surprise when he saw mr  lorry  and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state 

 well   said that good natured emissary  after a full half hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question   i have been to
soho  

 to soho   repeated mr  stryver  coldly   oh  to be sure  what am i
thinking of  

 and i have no doubt   said mr  lorry   that i was right in the
conversation we had  my opinion is confirmed  and i reiterate my
advice  

 i assure you   returned mr  stryver  in the friendliest way   that i
am sorry for it on your account  and sorry for it on the poor father  
account  i know this must always be a sore subject with the family  let
us say no more about it  

 i don   understand you   said mr  lorry 

 i dare say not   rejoined stryver  nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way   no matter  no matter  

 but it does matter   mr  lorry urged 

 no it doesn    i assure you it doesn    having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense  and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition  i am well out of my mistake  and no harm is
done  young women have committed similar follies often before  and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before  in an unselfish
aspect  i am sorry that the thing is dropped  because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view  in a selfish aspect  i am
glad that the thing has dropped  because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view  it is hardly necessary to say i could
have gained nothing by it  there is no harm at all done  i have not
proposed to the young lady  and  between ourselves  i am by no means
certain  on reflection  that i ever should have committed myself to
that extent  mr  lorry  you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty headed girls  you must not expect to do it  or you
will always be disappointed  now  pray say no more about it  i tell you 
i regret it on account of others  but i am satisfied on my own account 
and i am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you 
and for giving me your advice  you know the young lady better than i do 
you were right  it never would have done  

mr  lorry was so taken aback  that he looked quite stupidly at mr 
stryver shouldering him towards the door  with an appearance of
showering generosity  forbearance  and goodwill  on his erring head 
 make the best of it  my dear sir   said stryver   say no more about it 
thank you again for allowing me to sound you  good night  

mr  lorry was out in the night  before he knew where he was  mr  stryver
was lying back on his sofa  winking at his ceiling 




xiii  the fellow of no delicacy


if sydney carton ever shone anywhere  he certainly never shone in the
house of doctor manette  he had been there often  during a whole year 
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there  when he
cared to talk  he talked well  but  the cloud of caring for nothing 
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness  was very rarely
pierced by the light within him 

and yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house 
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements  many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there  when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him  many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there  and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief  removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings  as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things  else forgotten and unattainable 
into his mind  of late  the neglected bed in the temple court had known
him more scantily than ever  and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes  he had got up again  and haunted that
neighbourhood 

on a day in august  when mr  stryver  after notifying to his jackal
that  he had thought better of that marrying matter   had carried his
delicacy into devonshire  and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
city streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst  of health
for the sickliest  and of youth for the oldest  sydney   feet still trod
those stones  from being irresolute and purposeless  his feet became
animated by an intention  and  in the working out of that intention 
they took him to the doctor   door 

he was shown up stairs  and found lucie at her work  alone  she had
never been quite at her ease with him  and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table  but  looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few common places  she observed
a change in it 

 i fear you are not well  mr  carton  

 no  but the life i lead  miss manette  is not conducive to health  what
is to be expected of  or by  such profligates  

 is it not  forgive me  i have begun the question on my lips  a pity to
live no better life  

 god knows it is a shame  

 then why not change it  

looking gently at him again  she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes  there were tears in his voice too  as he
answered 

 it is too late for that  i shall never be better than i am  i shall
sink lower  and be worse  

he leaned an elbow on her table  and covered his eyes with his hand  the
table trembled in the silence that followed 

she had never seen him softened  and was much distressed  he knew her to
be so  without looking at her  and said 

 pray forgive me  miss manette  i break down before the knowledge of
what i want to say to you  will you hear me  

 if it will do you any good  mr  carton  if it would make you happier 
it would make me very glad  

 god bless you for your sweet compassion  

he unshaded his face after a little while  and spoke steadily 

 don   be afraid to hear me  don   shrink from anything i say  i am like
one who died young  all my life might have been  

 no  mr  carton  i am sure that the best part of it might still be  i am
sure that you might be much  much worthier of yourself  

 say of you  miss manette  and although i know better  although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart i know better  i shall never forget
it  

she was pale and trembling  he came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden 

 if it had been possible  miss manette  that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself  flung away  wasted  drunken 
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be  he would have been
conscious this day and hour  in spite of his happiness  that he would
bring you to misery  bring you to sorrow and repentance  blight you 
disgrace you  pull you down with him  i know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me  i ask for none  i am even thankful that it cannot
be  

 without it  can i not save you  mr  carton  can i not recall
you  forgive me again   to a better course  can i in no way repay your
confidence  i know this is a confidence   she modestly said  after a
little hesitation  and in earnest tears   i know you would say this to
no one else  can i turn it to no good account for yourself  mr  carton  

he shook his head 

 to none  no  miss manette  to none  if you will hear me through a very
little more  all you can ever do for me is done  i wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul  in my degradation i have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father  and of this
home made such a home by you  has stirred old shadows that i thought had
died out of me  since i knew you  i have been troubled by a remorse that
i thought would never reproach me again  and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward  that i thought were silent for ever  i
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh  beginning anew  shaking off
sloth and sensuality  and fighting out the abandoned fight  a dream  all
a dream  that ends in nothing  and leaves the sleeper where he lay down 
but i wish you to know that you inspired it  

 will nothing of it remain  o mr  carton  think again  try again  

 no  miss manette  all through it  i have known myself to be quite
undeserving  and yet i have had the weakness  and have still the
weakness  to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me 
heap of ashes that i am  into fire  a fire  however  inseparable in
its nature from myself  quickening nothing  lighting nothing  doing no
service  idly burning away  

 since it is my misfortune  mr  carton  to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me   

 don   say that  miss manette  for you would have reclaimed me  if
anything could  you will not be the cause of my becoming worse  

 since the state of your mind that you describe  is  at all events 
attributable to some influence of mine  this is what i mean  if i can
make it plain  can i use no influence to serve you  have i no power for
good  with you  at all  

 the utmost good that i am capable of now  miss manette  i have come
here to realise  let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life 
the remembrance that i opened my heart to you  last of all the world 
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity  

 which i entreated you to believe  again and again  most fervently  with
all my heart  was capable of better things  mr  carton  

 entreat me to believe it no more  miss manette  i have proved myself 
and i know better  i distress you  i draw fast to an end  will you let
me believe  when i recall this day  that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast  and that it lies there
alone  and will be shared by no one  

 if that will be a consolation to you  yes  

 not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you  

 mr  carton   she answered  after an agitated pause   the secret is
yours  not mine  and i promise to respect it  

 thank you  and again  god bless you  

he put her hand to his lips  and moved towards the door 

 be under no apprehension  miss manette  of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word  i will never refer to it
again  if i were dead  that could not be surer than it is henceforth  in
the hour of my death  i shall hold sacred the one good remembrance  and
shall thank and bless you for it  that my last avowal of myself was made
to you  and that my name  and faults  and miseries were gently carried
in your heart  may it otherwise be light and happy  

he was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be  and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away  and how much he every day kept
down and perverted  that lucie manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her 

 be comforted   he said   i am not worth such feeling  miss manette  an
hour or two hence  and the low companions and low habits that i scorn
but yield to  will render me less worth such tears as those  than any
wretch who creeps along the streets  be comforted  but  within myself  i
shall always be  towards you  what i am now  though outwardly i shall be
what you have heretofore seen me  the last supplication but one i make
to you  is  that you will believe this of me  

 i will  mr  carton  

 my last supplication of all  is this  and with it  i will relieve
you of a visitor with whom i well know you have nothing in unison  and
between whom and you there is an impassable space  it is useless to say
it  i know  but it rises out of my soul  for you  and for any dear to
you  i would do anything  if my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it  i would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you  try to hold
me in your mind  at some quiet times  as ardent and sincere in this one
thing  the time will come  the time will not be long in coming  when new
ties will be formed about you  ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn  the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you  o miss manette  when the little picture of a
happy father   face looks up in yours  when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet  think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life  to keep a life you love beside you  

he said   farewell   said a last  god bless you   and left her 




xiv  the honest tradesman


to the eyes of mr  jeremiah cruncher  sitting on his stool in
fleet street with his grisly urchin beside him  a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented  who could sit
upon anything in fleet street during the busy hours of the day  and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions  one ever tending
westward with the sun  the other ever tending eastward from the sun 
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down 

with his straw in his mouth  mr  cruncher sat watching the two streams 
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream  saving that jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry  nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind 
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women  mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life  from
tellson   side of the tides to the opposite shore  brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance  mr  cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health  and it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose  that he recruited his finances  as just now observed 

time was  when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place  and mused in
the sight of men  mr  cruncher  sitting on a stool in a public place 
but not being a poet  mused as little as possible  and looked about him 

it fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few  and belated women few  and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that mrs 
cruncher must have been  flopping  in some pointed manner  when an
unusual concourse pouring down fleet street westward  attracted his
attention  looking that way  mr  cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along  and that there was popular objection to this
funeral  which engendered uproar 

 young jerry   said mr  cruncher  turning to his offspring   it   a
buryin   

 hooroar  father   cried young jerry 

the young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance  the elder gentleman took the cry so ill  that he watched
his opportunity  and smote the young gentleman on the ear 

 what   ye mean  what are you hooroaring at  what do you want to conwey
to your own father  you young rip  this boy is a getting too many for
 me    said mr  cruncher  surveying him   him and his hooroars  don  
let me hear no more of you  or you shall feel some more of me    ye
hear  

 i warn   doing no harm   young jerry protested  rubbing his cheek 

 drop it then   said mr  cruncher   i won   have none of  your  no
harms  get a top of that there seat  and look at the crowd  

his son obeyed  and the crowd approached  they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach  in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner  dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position  the position
appeared by no means to please him  however  with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach  deriding him  making grimaces at him  and
incessantly groaning and calling out   yah  spies  tst  yaha  spies  
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat 

funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for mr  cruncher  he
always pricked up his senses  and became excited  when a funeral passed
tellson    naturally  therefore  a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly  and he asked of the first man who ran against him 

 what is it  brother  what   it about  

  i  don   know   said the man   spies  yaha  tst  spies  

he asked another man   who is it  

  i  don   know   returned the man  clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless  and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour   spies  yaha  tst  tst  spi  ies  

at length  a person better informed on the merits of the case  tumbled
against him  and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one roger cly 

 was he a spy   asked mr  cruncher 

 old bailey spy   returned his informant   yaha  tst  yah  old bailey
spi  i  ies  

 why  to be sure   exclaimed jerry  recalling the trial at which he had
assisted   i ve seen him  dead  is he  

 dead as mutton   returned the other   and can   be too dead  have  em
out  there  spies  pull  em out  there  spies  

the idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea 
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness  and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have  em out  and to pull  em out  mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop  on the crowd   opening the coach
doors  the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment  but he was so alert  and made such good use of his time 
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye street  after
shedding his cloak  hat  long hatband  white pocket handkerchief  and
other symbolical tears 

these  the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment  while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops  for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing  and was a monster much dreaded 
they had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out  when some brighter genius proposed instead  its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing  practical suggestions being
much needed  this suggestion  too  was received with acclamation  and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out 
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it  among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself  who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tellson    in the further corner of the mourning
coach 

the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies  but  the river being alarmingly near  and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason  the protest was faint and brief 
the remodelled procession started  with a chimney sweep driving the
hearse  advised by the regular driver  who was perched beside him  under
close inspection  for the purpose  and with a pieman  also attended
by his cabinet minister  driving the mourning coach  a bear leader  a
popular street character of the time  was impressed as an additional
ornament  before the cavalcade had gone far down the strand  and his
bear  who was black and very mangy  gave quite an undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked 

thus  with beer drinking  pipe smoking  song roaring  and infinite
caricaturing of woe  the disorderly procession went its way  recruiting
at every step  and all the shops shutting up before it  its destination
was the old church of saint pancras  far off in the fields  it got there
in course of time  insisted on pouring into the burial ground  finally 
accomplished the interment of the deceased roger cly in its own way  and
highly to its own satisfaction 

the dead man disposed of  and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself  another brighter
genius  or perhaps the same  conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers by  as old bailey spies  and wreaking vengeance on them  chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the old bailey in their lives  in the realisation of this fancy  and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated  the transition to the sport of
window breaking  and thence to the plundering of public houses  was easy
and natural  at last  after several hours  when sundry summer houses had
been pulled down  and some area railings had been torn up  to arm
the more belligerent spirits  a rumour got about that the guards were
coming  before this rumour  the crowd gradually melted away  and perhaps
the guards came  and perhaps they never came  and this was the usual
progress of a mob 

mr  cruncher did not assist at the closing sports  but had remained
behind in the churchyard  to confer and condole with the undertakers 
the place had a soothing influence on him  he procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public house  and smoked it  looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot 

 jerry   said mr  cruncher  apostrophising himself in his usual way 
 you see that there cly that day  and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young  un and a straight made  un  

having smoked his pipe out  and ruminated a little longer  he turned
himself about  that he might appear  before the hour of closing  on his
station at tellson    whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver  or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss  or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man  is not so much to the purpose  as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser  a distinguished surgeon  on his way back 

young jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest  and reported no
job in his absence  the bank closed  the ancient clerks came out  the
usual watch was set  and mr  cruncher and his son went home to tea 

 now  i tell you where it is   said mr  cruncher to his wife  on
entering   if  as a honest tradesman  my wenturs goes wrong to night  i
shall make sure that you ve been praying again me  and i shall work you
for it just the same as if i seen you do it  

the dejected mrs  cruncher shook her head 

 why  you re at it afore my face   said mr  cruncher  with signs of
angry apprehension 

 i am saying nothing  

 well  then  don   meditate nothing  you might as well flop as meditate 
you may as well go again me one way as another  drop it altogether  

 yes  jerry  

 yes  jerry   repeated mr  cruncher sitting down to tea   ah  it  is 
yes  jerry  that   about it  you may say yes  jerry  

mr  cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations 
but made use of them  as people not unfrequently do  to express general
ironical dissatisfaction 

 you and your yes  jerry   said mr  cruncher  taking a bite out of his
bread and butter  and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer   ah  i think so  i believe you  

 you are going out to night   asked his decent wife  when he took
another bite 

 yes  i am  

 may i go with you  father   asked his son  briskly 

 no  you mayn    i   a going  as your mother knows  a fishing  that  
where i   going to  going a fishing  

 your fishing rod gets rayther rusty  don   it  father  

 never you mind  

 shall you bring any fish home  father  

 if i don    you ll have short commons  to morrow   returned that
gentleman  shaking his head   that   questions enough for you  i ain   a
going out  till you ve been long abed  

he devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on mrs  cruncher  and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage  with this view  he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also  and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her  rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections  the devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife  it was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story 

 and mind you   said mr  cruncher   no games to morrow  if i  as a
honest tradesman  succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two  none
of your not touching of it  and sticking to bread  if i  as a honest
tradesman  am able to provide a little beer  none of your declaring
on water  when you go to rome  do as rome does  rome will be a ugly
customer to you  if you don     i    your rome  you know  

then he began grumbling again 

 with your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink  i don  
know how scarce you mayn   make the wittles and drink here  by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct  look at your boy  he  is 
your    ain   he  he   as thin as a lath  do you call yourself a mother 
and not know that a mother   first duty is to blow her boy out  

this touched young jerry on a tender place  who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty  and  whatever else she did or neglected  above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent 

thus the evening wore away with the cruncher family  until young jerry
was ordered to bed  and his mother  laid under similar injunctions 
obeyed them  mr  cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes  and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
o clock  towards that small and ghostly hour  he rose up from his chair 
took a key out of his pocket  opened a locked cupboard  and brought
forth a sack  a crowbar of convenient size  a rope and chain  and other
fishing tackle of that nature  disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner  he bestowed a parting defiance on mrs  cruncher 
extinguished the light  and went out 

young jerry  who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed  was not long after his father  under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room  followed down the stairs  followed down the
court  followed out into the streets  he was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again  for it was full of lodgers  and the
door stood ajar all night 

impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father   honest calling  young jerry  keeping as close to house fronts 
walls  and doorways  as his eyes were close to one another  held his
honoured parent in view  the honoured parent steering northward  had not
gone far  when he was joined by another disciple of izaak walton  and
the two trudged on together 

within half an hour from the first starting  they were beyond the
winking lamps  and the more than winking watchmen  and were out upon a
lonely road  another fisherman was picked up here  and that so silently 
that if young jerry had been superstitious  he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have  all of a sudden  split
himself into two 

the three went on  and young jerry went on  until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road  upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall  surmounted by an iron railing  in the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road  and up a blind lane  of which
the wall  there  risen to some eight or ten feet high  formed one side 
crouching down in a corner  peeping up the lane  the next object that
young jerry saw  was the form of his honoured parent  pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon  nimbly scaling an iron gate 
he was soon over  and then the second fisherman got over  and then the
third  they all dropped softly on the ground within the gate  and lay
there a little  listening perhaps  then  they moved away on their hands
and knees 

it was now young jerry   turn to approach the gate  which he did 
holding his breath  crouching down again in a corner there  and looking
in  he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass 
and all the gravestones in the churchyard  it was a large churchyard
that they were in  looking on like ghosts in white  while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant  they did not
creep far  before they stopped and stood upright  and then they began to
fish 

they fished with a spade  at first  presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew 
whatever tools they worked with  they worked hard  until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified young jerry  that he made off 
with his hair as stiff as his father   

but  his long cherished desire to know more about these matters  not
only stopped him in his running away  but lured him back again  they
were still fishing perseveringly  when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time  but  now they seemed to have got a bite  there was a
screwing and complaining sound down below  and their bent figures were
strained  as if by a weight  by slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it  and came to the surface  young jerry very well knew what
it would be  but  when he saw it  and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open  he was so frightened  being new to the sight  that he
made off again  and never stopped until he had run a mile or more 

he would not have stopped then  for anything less necessary than breath 
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran  and one highly desirable
to get to the end of  he had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him  and  pictured as hopping on behind him  bolt
upright  upon its narrow end  always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side  perhaps taking his arm  it was a pursuer to
shun  it was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too  for  while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful  he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys  fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy   kite without tail and wings  it hid in doorways
too  rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors  and drawing them up
to its ears  as if it were laughing  it got into shadows on the road 
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up  all this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him  so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead  and even then
it would not leave him  but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair  scrambled into bed with him  and bumped down  dead and heavy  on
his breast when he fell asleep 

from his oppressed slumber  young jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise  by the presence of his father in the
family room  something had gone wrong with him  at least  so young jerry
inferred  from the circumstance of his holding mrs  cruncher by the
ears  and knocking the back of her head against the head board of the
bed 

 i told you i would   said mr  cruncher   and i did  

 jerry  jerry  jerry   his wife implored 

 you oppose yourself to the profit of the business   said jerry   and me
and my partners suffer  you was to honour and obey  why the devil don  
you  

 i try to be a good wife  jerry   the poor woman protested  with tears 

 is it being a good wife to oppose your husband   business  is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business  is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business  

 you hadn   taken to the dreadful business then  jerry  

 it   enough for you   retorted mr  cruncher   to be the wife of a
honest tradesman  and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn    a honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether  call yourself a religious
woman  if you re a religious woman  give me a irreligious one  you have
no more nat ral sense of duty than the bed of this here thames river has
of a pile  and similarly it must be knocked into you  

the altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice  and terminated in
the honest tradesman   kicking off his clay soiled boots  and lying down
at his length on the floor  after taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back  with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow  his son lay
down too  and fell asleep again 

there was no fish for breakfast  and not much of anything else  mr 
cruncher was out of spirits  and out of temper  and kept an iron pot lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of mrs  cruncher  in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying grace  he was brushed
and washed at the usual hour  and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling 

young jerry  walking with the stool under his arm at his father   side
along sunny and crowded fleet street  was a very different young jerry
from him of the previous night  running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer  his cunning was fresh with the day 
and his qualms were gone with the night  in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in fleet street and the city of london 
that fine morning 

 father   said young jerry  as they walked along  taking care to keep
at arm   length and to have the stool well between them   what   a
resurrection man  

mr  cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered   how
should i know  

 i thought you knowed everything  father   said the artless boy 

 hem  well   returned mr  cruncher  going on again  and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play   he   a tradesman  

 what   his goods  father   asked the brisk young jerry 

 his goods   said mr  cruncher  after turning it over in his mind   is a
branch of scientific goods  

 persons  bodies  ain   it  father   asked the lively boy 

 i believe it is something of that sort   said mr  cruncher 

 oh  father  i should so like to be a resurrection man when i   quite
growed up  

mr  cruncher was soothed  but shook his head in a dubious and moral way 
 it depends upon how you dewelop your talents  be careful to dewelop
your talents  and never to say no more than you can help to nobody  and
there   no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for   as young jerry  thus encouraged  went on a few yards in advance 
to plant the stool in the shadow of the bar  mr  cruncher added to
himself   jerry  you honest tradesman  there   hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you  and a recompense to you for his mother  




xv  knitting


there had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine shop of monsieur
defarge  as early as six o clock in the morning  sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within  bending over
measures of wine  monsieur defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times  but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time  a sour wine  moreover  or a souring  for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy  no
vivacious bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of monsieur
defarge  but  a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark  lay hidden in
the dregs of it 

this had been the third morning in succession  on which there had been
early drinking at the wine shop of monsieur defarge  it had begun
on monday  and here was wednesday come  there had been more of early
brooding than drinking  for  many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door  who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls  these
were to the full as interested in the place  however  as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine  and they glided from seat to seat 
and from corner to corner  swallowing talk in lieu of drink  with greedy
looks 

notwithstanding an unusual flow of company  the master of the wine shop
was not visible  he was not missed  for  nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him  nobody asked for him  nobody wondered to see
only madame defarge in her seat  presiding over the distribution of
wine  with a bowl of battered small coins before her  as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come 

a suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind  were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine shop  as they looked in
at every place  high and low  from the king   palace to the criminal  
gaol  games at cards languished  players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them  drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine  madame defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick  and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off 

thus  saint antoine in this vinous feature of his  until midday  it was
high noontide  when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps  of whom  one was monsieur defarge  the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap  all adust and athirst  the two entered
the wine shop  their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of saint antoine  fast spreading as they came along  which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows  yet  no one had
followed them  and no man spoke when they entered the wine shop  though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them 

 good day  gentlemen   said monsieur defarge 

it may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue  it elicited
an answering chorus of  good day  

 it is bad weather  gentlemen   said defarge  shaking his head 

upon which  every man looked at his neighbour  and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent  except one man  who got up and went out 

 my wife   said defarge aloud  addressing madame defarge   i have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads  called
jacques  i met him  by accident  a day and half   journey out of paris 
he is a good child  this mender of roads  called jacques  give him to
drink  my wife  

a second man got up and went out  madame defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called jacques  who doffed his blue cap to the company 
and drank  in the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread  he ate of this between whiles  and sat munching and drinking near
madame defarge   counter  a third man got up and went out 

defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine  but  he took less
than was given to the stranger  as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity  and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast 
he looked at no one present  and no one now looked at him  not even
madame defarge  who had taken up her knitting  and was at work 

 have you finished your repast  friend   he asked  in due season 

 yes  thank you  

 come  then  you shall see the apartment that i told you you could
occupy  it will suit you to a marvel  

out of the wine shop into the street  out of the street into a
courtyard  out of the courtyard up a steep staircase  out of the
staircase into a garret  formerly the garret where a white haired man
sat on a low bench  stooping forward and very busy  making shoes 

no white haired man was there now  but  the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine shop singly  and between them and the white haired
man afar off  was the one small link  that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall 

defarge closed the door carefully  and spoke in a subdued voice 

 jacques one  jacques two  jacques three  this is the witness
encountered by appointment  by me  jacques four  he will tell you all 
speak  jacques five  

the mender of roads  blue cap in hand  wiped his swarthy forehead with
it  and said   where shall i commence  monsieur  

 commence   was monsieur defarge   not unreasonable reply   at the
commencement  

 i saw him then  messieurs   began the mender of roads   a year ago this
running summer  underneath the carriage of the marquis  hanging by the
chain  behold the manner of it  i leaving my work on the road  the sun
going to bed  the carriage of the marquis slowly ascending the hill  he
hanging by the chain  like this  

again the mender of roads went through the whole performance  in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time  seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during a whole year 

jacques one struck in  and asked if he had ever seen the man before 

 never   answered the mender of roads  recovering his perpendicular 

jacques three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then 

 by his tall figure   said the mender of roads  softly  and with his
finger at his nose   when monsieur the marquis demands that evening 
 say  what is he like   i make response   tall as a spectre   

 you should have said  short as a dwarf   returned jacques two 

 but what did i know  the deed was not then accomplished  neither did he
confide in me  observe  under those circumstances even  i do not
offer my testimony  monsieur the marquis indicates me with his finger 
standing near our little fountain  and says   to me  bring that rascal  
my faith  messieurs  i offer nothing  

 he is right there  jacques   murmured defarge  to him who had
interrupted   go on  

 good   said the mender of roads  with an air of mystery   the tall man
is lost  and he is sought  how many months  nine  ten  eleven  

 no matter  the number   said defarge   he is well hidden  but at last
he is unluckily found  go on  

 i am again at work upon the hill side  and the sun is again about to
go to bed  i am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below  where it is already dark  when i raise my eyes  and see
coming over the hill six soldiers  in the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound  tied to his sides  like this  

with the aid of his indispensable cap  he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips  with cords that were knotted behind him 

 i stand aside  messieurs  by my heap of stones  to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass  for it is a solitary road  that  where any
spectacle is well worth looking at   and at first  as they approach  i
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound  and
that they are almost black to my sight  except on the side of the sun
going to bed  where they have a red edge  messieurs  also  i see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road  and are on the hill above it  and are like the shadows of giants 
also  i see that they are covered with dust  and that the dust moves
with them as they come  tramp  tramp  but when they advance quite near
to me  i recognise the tall man  and he recognises me  ah  but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill side once again  as
on the evening when he and i first encountered  close to the same spot  

he described it as if he were there  and it was evident that he saw it
vividly  perhaps he had not seen much in his life 

 i do not show the soldiers that i recognise the tall man  he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me  we do it  and we know it  with
our eyes   come on   says the chief of that company  pointing to the
village   bring him fast to his tomb   and they bring him faster  i
follow  his arms are swelled because of being bound so tight  his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy  and he is lame  because he is lame  and
consequently slow  they drive him with their guns  like this  

he imitated the action of a man   being impelled forward by the
butt ends of muskets 

 as they descend the hill like madmen running a race  he falls  they
laugh and pick him up again  his face is bleeding and covered with dust 
but he cannot touch it  thereupon they laugh again  they bring him into
the village  all the village runs to look  they take him past the mill 
and up to the prison  all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night  and swallow him  like this  

he opened his mouth as wide as he could  and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth  observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again  defarge said   go on  jacques  

 all the village   pursued the mender of roads  on tiptoe and in a low
voice   withdraws  all the village whispers by the fountain  all the
village sleeps  all the village dreams of that unhappy one  within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag  and never to come out of it 
except to perish  in the morning  with my tools upon my shoulder  eating
my morsel of black bread as i go  i make a circuit by the prison  on
my way to my work  there i see him  high up  behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage  bloody and dusty as last night  looking through  he has no
hand free  to wave to me  i dare not call to him  he regards me like a
dead man  

defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another  the looks of all
of them were dark  repressed  and revengeful  as they listened to the
countryman   story  the manner of all of them  while it was secret  was
authoritative too  they had the air of a rough tribunal  jacques one
and two sitting on the old pallet bed  each with his chin resting on
his hand  and his eyes intent on the road mender  jacques three  equally
intent  on one knee behind them  with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose  defarge
standing between them and the narrator  whom he had stationed in the
light of the window  by turns looking from him to them  and from them to
him 

 go on  jacques   said defarge 

 he remains up there in his iron cage some days  the village looks
at him by stealth  for it is afraid  but it always looks up  from a
distance  at the prison on the crag  and in the evening  when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain  all
faces are turned towards the prison  formerly  they were turned towards
the posting house  now  they are turned towards the prison  they
whisper at the fountain  that although condemned to death he will not be
executed  they say that petitions have been presented in paris  showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child  they say
that a petition has been presented to the king himself  what do i know 
it is possible  perhaps yes  perhaps no  

 listen then  jacques   number one of that name sternly interposed 
 know that a petition was presented to the king and queen  all here 
yourself excepted  saw the king take it  in his carriage in the street 
sitting beside the queen  it is defarge whom you see here  who  at the
hazard of his life  darted out before the horses  with the petition in
his hand  

 and once again listen  jacques   said the kneeling number three 
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves  with a
strikingly greedy air  as if he hungered for something  that was neither
food nor drink   the guard  horse and foot  surrounded the petitioner 
and struck him blows  you hear  

 i hear  messieurs  

 go on then   said defarge 

 again  on the other hand  they whisper at the fountain   resumed the
countryman   that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot  and that he will very certainly be executed  they even whisper
that because he has slain monseigneur  and because monseigneur was the
father of his tenants  serfs  what you will  he will be executed as a
parricide  one old man says at the fountain  that his right hand  armed
with the knife  will be burnt off before his face  that  into wounds
which will be made in his arms  his breast  and his legs  there will be
poured boiling oil  melted lead  hot resin  wax  and sulphur  finally 
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses  that old man
says  all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late king  louis fifteen  but how do i know if he lies 
i am not a scholar  

 listen once again then  jacques   said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air   the name of that prisoner was damiens  and it was
all done in open day  in the open streets of this city of paris  and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done  than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion  who were full of eager
attention to the last  to the last  jacques  prolonged until nightfall 
when he had lost two legs and an arm  and still breathed  and it was
done  why  how old are you  

 thirty five   said the mender of roads  who looked sixty 

 it was done when you were more than ten years old  you might have seen
it  

 enough   said defarge  with grim impatience   long live the devil  go
on  

 well  some whisper this  some whisper that  they speak of nothing else 
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune  at length  on sunday
night when all the village is asleep  come soldiers  winding down from
the prison  and their guns ring on the stones of the little street 
workmen dig  workmen hammer  soldiers laugh and sing  in the morning  by
the fountain  there is raised a gallows forty feet high  poisoning the
water  

the mender of roads looked  through  rather than  at  the low ceiling 
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky 

 all work is stopped  all assemble there  nobody leads the cows out 
the cows are there with the rest  at midday  the roll of drums  soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night  and he is in the midst
of many soldiers  he is bound as before  and in his mouth there is
a gag  tied so  with a tight string  making him look almost as if he
laughed   he suggested it  by creasing his face with his two thumbs 
from the corners of his mouth to his ears   on the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife  blade upwards  with its point in the air  he is hanged
there forty feet high  and is left hanging  poisoning the water  

they looked at one another  as he used his blue cap to wipe his face 
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle 

 it is frightful  messieurs  how can the women and the children draw
water  who can gossip of an evening  under that shadow  under it  have
i said  when i left the village  monday evening as the sun was going to
bed  and looked back from the hill  the shadow struck across the church 
across the mill  across the prison  seemed to strike across the earth 
messieurs  to where the sky rests upon it  

the hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three  and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him 

 that   all  messieurs  i left at sunset  as i had been warned to do  
and i walked on  that night and half next day  until i met  as i was
warned i should  this comrade  with him  i came on  now riding and now
walking  through the rest of yesterday and through last night  and here
you see me  

after a gloomy silence  the first jacques said   good  you have acted
and recounted faithfully  will you wait for us a little  outside the
door  

 very willingly   said the mender of roads  whom defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs  and  leaving seated there  returned 

the three had risen  and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret 

 how say you  jacques   demanded number one   to be registered  

 to be registered  as doomed to destruction   returned defarge 

 magnificent   croaked the man with the craving 

 the chateau  and all the race   inquired the first 

 the chateau and all the race   returned defarge   extermination  

the hungry man repeated  in a rapturous croak   magnificent   and began
gnawing another finger 

 are you sure   asked jacques two  of defarge   that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register  without doubt it is
safe  for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it  but shall we always
be able to decipher it  or  i ought to say  will she  

 jacques   returned defarge  drawing himself up   if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone  she would not lose
a word of it  not a syllable of it  knitted  in her own stitches and her
own symbols  it will always be as plain to her as the sun  confide in
madame defarge  it would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives 
to erase himself from existence  than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of madame defarge  

there was a murmur of confidence and approval  and then the man who
hungered  asked   is this rustic to be sent back soon  i hope so  he is
very simple  is he not a little dangerous  

 he knows nothing   said defarge   at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height  i charge myself
with him  let him remain with me  i will take care of him  and set him
on his road  he wishes to see the fine world  the king  the queen  and
court  let him see them on sunday  

 what   exclaimed the hungry man  staring   is it a good sign  that he
wishes to see royalty and nobility  

 jacques   said defarge   judiciously show a cat milk  if you wish her
to thirst for it  judiciously show a dog his natural prey  if you wish
him to bring it down one day  

nothing more was said  and the mender of roads  being found already
dozing on the topmost stair  was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet bed and take some rest  he needed no persuasion  and was soon
asleep 

worse quarters than defarge   wine shop  could easily have been found
in paris for a provincial slave of that degree  saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted  his life was very
new and agreeable  but  madame sat all day at her counter  so expressly
unconscious of him  and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface  that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her  for  he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next  and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim  she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out 

therefore  when sunday came  the mender of roads was not enchanted
 though he said he was  to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to versailles  it was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there  in a public conveyance  it was
additionally disconcerting yet  to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon  still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the king and queen 

 you work hard  madame   said a man near her 

 yes   answered madame defarge   i have a good deal to do  

 what do you make  madame  

 many things  

 for instance   

 for instance   returned madame defarge  composedly   shrouds  

the man moved a little further away  as soon as he could  and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap  feeling it mightily close
and oppressive  if he needed a king and queen to restore him  he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand  for  soon the large faced king
and the fair faced queen came in their golden coach  attended by the
shining bull   eye of their court  a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords  and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes  the mender of roads bathed himself  so much to his temporary
intoxication  that he cried long live the king  long live the queen 
long live everybody and everything  as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous jacques in his time  then  there were gardens  courtyards 
terraces  fountains  green banks  more king and queen  more bull   eye 
more lords and ladies  more long live they all  until he absolutely wept
with sentiment  during the whole of this scene  which lasted some three
hours  he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company 
and throughout defarge held him by the collar  as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces 

 bravo   said defarge  clapping him on the back when it was over  like a
patron   you are a good boy  

the mender of roads was now coming to himself  and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations  but no 

 you are the fellow we want   said defarge  in his ear   you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever  then  they are the more
insolent  and it is the nearer ended  

 hey   cried the mender of roads  reflectively   that   true  

 these fools know nothing  while they despise your breath  and would
stop it for ever and ever  in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs  they only know what your breath
tells them  let it deceive them  then  a little longer  it cannot
deceive them too much  

madame defarge looked superciliously at the client  and nodded in
confirmation 

 as to you   said she   you would shout and shed tears for anything  if
it made a show and a noise  say  would you not  

 truly  madame  i think so  for the moment  

 if you were shown a great heap of dolls  and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage  you would
pick out the richest and gayest  say  would you not  

 truly yes  madame  

 yes  and if you were shown a flock of birds  unable to fly  and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage 
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers  would you not  

 it is true  madame  

 you have seen both dolls and birds to day   said madame defarge  with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent 
 now  go home  




xvi  still knitting


madame defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of saint antoine  while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness  and through the dust  and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside  slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of monsieur the marquis  now in his grave  listened to
the whispering trees  such ample leisure had the stone faces  now 
for listening to the trees and to the fountain  that the few village
scarecrows who  in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn  strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase  had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered  a rumour just lived in the
village  had a faint and bare existence there  as its people had  that
when the knife struck home  the faces changed  from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain  also  that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain  they changed again  and bore a cruel
look of being avenged  which they would henceforth bear for ever  in the
stone face over the great window of the bed chamber where the murder
was done  two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose  which
everybody recognised  and which nobody had seen of old  and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at monsieur the marquis petrified  a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute  before they all
started away among the moss and leaves  like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there 

chateau and hut  stone face and dangling figure  the red stain on the
stone floor  and the pure water in the village well  thousands of acres
of land  a whole province of france  all france itself  lay under the
night sky  concentrated into a faint hair breadth line  so does a whole
world  with all its greatnesses and littlenesses  lie in a twinkling
star  and as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition  so  sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours  every thought and act  every
vice and virtue  of every responsible creature on it 

the defarges  husband and wife  came lumbering under the starlight 
in their public vehicle  to that gate of paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended  there was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse  and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry  monsieur defarge alighted  knowing one or two
of the soldiery there  and one of the police  the latter he was intimate
with  and affectionately embraced 

when saint antoine had again enfolded the defarges in his dusky wings 
and they  having finally alighted near the saint   boundaries  were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets  madame defarge spoke to her husband 

 say then  my friend  what did jacques of the police tell thee  

 very little to night  but all he knows  there is another spy
commissioned for our quarter  there may be many more  for all that he
can say  but he knows of one  

 eh well   said madame defarge  raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air   it is necessary to register him  how do they call that
man  

 he is english  

 so much the better  his name  

 barsad   said defarge  making it french by pronunciation  but  he had
been so careful to get it accurately  that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness 

 barsad   repeated madame   good  christian name  

 john  

 john barsad   repeated madame  after murmuring it once to herself 
 good  his appearance  is it known  

 age  about forty years  height  about five feet nine  black hair 
complexion dark  generally  rather handsome visage  eyes dark  face
thin  long  and sallow  nose aquiline  but not straight  having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek  expression  therefore 
sinister  

 eh my faith  it is a portrait   said madame  laughing   he shall be
registered to morrow  

they turned into the wine shop  which was closed  for it was midnight  
and where madame defarge immediately took her post at her desk  counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence  examined the
stock  went through the entries in the book  made other entries of
her own  checked the serving man in every possible way  and finally
dismissed him to bed  then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time  and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief  in a chain of separate knots  for safe keeping through the
night  all this while  defarge  with his pipe in his mouth  walked
up and down  complacently admiring  but never interfering  in which
condition  indeed  as to the business and his domestic affairs  he
walked up and down through life 

the night was hot  and the shop  close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood  was ill smelling  monsieur defarge   olfactory sense was
by no means delicate  but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted  and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed  he
whiffed the compound of scents away  as he put down his smoked out pipe 

 you are fatigued   said madame  raising her glance as she knotted the
money   there are only the usual odours  

 i am a little tired   her husband acknowledged 

 you are a little depressed  too   said madame  whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts  but they had had a ray or two for
him   oh  the men  the men  

 but my dear   began defarge 

 but my dear   repeated madame  nodding firmly   but my dear  you are
faint of heart to night  my dear  

 well  then   said defarge  as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast   it  is  a long time  

 it is a long time   repeated his wife   and when is it not a long time 
vengeance and retribution require a long time  it is the rule  

 it does not take a long time to strike a man with lightning   said
defarge 

 how long   demanded madame  composedly   does it take to make and store
the lightning  tell me  

defarge raised his head thoughtfully  as if there were something in that
too 

 it does not take a long time   said madame   for an earthquake to
swallow a town  eh well  tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake  

 a long time  i suppose   said defarge 

 but when it is ready  it takes place  and grinds to pieces everything
before it  in the meantime  it is always preparing  though it is not
seen or heard  that is your consolation  keep it  

she tied a knot with flashing eyes  as if it throttled a foe 

 i tell thee   said madame  extending her right hand  for emphasis 
 that although it is a long time on the road  it is on the road and
coming  i tell thee it never retreats  and never stops  i tell thee it
is always advancing  look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know  consider the faces of all the world that we know  consider
the rage and discontent to which the jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour  can such things last  bah  i mock
you  

 my brave wife   returned defarge  standing before her with his head
a little bent  and his hands clasped at his back  like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist   i do not question all this  but
it has lasted a long time  and it is possible  you know well  my wife 
it is possible  that it may not come  during our lives  

 eh well  how then   demanded madame  tying another knot  as if there
were another enemy strangled 

 well   said defarge  with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug 
 we shall not see the triumph  

 we shall have helped it   returned madame  with her extended hand in
strong action   nothing that we do  is done in vain  i believe  with all
my soul  that we shall see the triumph  but even if not  even if i knew
certainly not  show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant  and still i
would   

then madame  with her teeth set  tied a very terrible knot indeed 

 hold   cried defarge  reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice   i too  my dear  will stop at nothing  

 yes  but it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity  to sustain you  sustain yourself without that 
when the time comes  let loose a tiger and a devil  but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained  not shown  yet always ready  

madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out  and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner  and observing that it was time to go to bed 

next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine shop  knitting away assiduously  a rose lay beside her  and if she
now and then glanced at the flower  it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air  there were a few customers  drinking or not
drinking  standing or seated  sprinkled about  the day was very hot 
and heaps of flies  who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame  fell
dead at the bottom  their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading  who looked at them in the coolest manner  as if they
themselves were elephants  or something as far removed   until they met
the same fate  curious to consider how heedless flies are   perhaps they
thought as much at court that sunny summer day 

a figure entering at the door threw a shadow on madame defarge which she
felt to be a new one  she laid down her knitting  and began to pin her
rose in her head dress  before she looked at the figure 

it was curious  the moment madame defarge took up the rose  the
customers ceased talking  and began gradually to drop out of the
wine shop 

 good day  madame   said the new comer 

 good day  monsieur  

she said it aloud  but added to herself  as she resumed her knitting 
 hah  good day  age about forty  height about five feet nine  black
hair  generally rather handsome visage  complexion dark  eyes dark 
thin  long and sallow face  aquiline nose but not straight  having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression  good day  one and all  

 have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac  and a
mouthful of cool fresh water  madame  

madame complied with a polite air 

 marvellous cognac this  madame  

it was the first time it had ever been so complimented  and madame
defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better  she said 
however  that the cognac was flattered  and took up her knitting  the
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments  and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general 

 you knit with great skill  madame  

 i am accustomed to it  

 a pretty pattern too  

  you  think so   said madame  looking at him with a smile 

 decidedly  may one ask what it is for  

 pastime   said madame  still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly 

 not for use  

 that depends  i may find a use for it one day  if i do  well   said
madame  drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry   i ll use it  

it was remarkable  but  the taste of saint antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head dress of madame defarge  two
men had entered separately  and had been about to order drink  when 
catching sight of that novelty  they faltered  made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there  and went away 
nor  of those who had been there when this visitor entered  was there
one left  they had all dropped off  the spy had kept his eyes open 
but had been able to detect no sign  they had lounged away in a
poverty stricken  purposeless  accidental manner  quite natural and
unimpeachable 

  john    thought madame  checking off her work as her fingers knitted 
and her eyes looked at the stranger   stay long enough  and i shall knit
 barsad  before you go  

 you have a husband  madame  

 i have  

 children  

 no children  

 business seems bad  

 business is very bad  the people are so poor  

 ah  the unfortunate  miserable people  so oppressed  too  as you say  

 as  you  say   madame retorted  correcting him  and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good 

 pardon me  certainly it was i who said so  but you naturally think so 
of course  

  i  think   returned madame  in a high voice   i and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine shop open  without thinking  all we
think  here  is how to live  that is the subject  we  think of  and
it gives us  from morning to night  enough to think about  without
embarrassing our heads concerning others   i  think for others  no  no  

the spy  who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make  did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face  but 
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry  leaning his elbow on madame
defarge   little counter  and occasionally sipping his cognac 

 a bad business this  madame  of gaspard   execution  ah  the poor
gaspard   with a sigh of great compassion 

 my faith   returned madame  coolly and lightly   if people use knives
for such purposes  they have to pay for it  he knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was  he has paid the price  

 i believe   said the spy  dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence  and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face   i believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood  touching the poor
fellow  between ourselves  

 is there   asked madame  vacantly 

 is there not  

   here is my husband   said madame defarge 

as the keeper of the wine shop entered at the door  the spy saluted
him by touching his hat  and saying  with an engaging smile   good day 
jacques   defarge stopped short  and stared at him 

 good day  jacques   the spy repeated  with not quite so much
confidence  or quite so easy a smile under the stare 

 you deceive yourself  monsieur   returned the keeper of the wine shop 
 you mistake me for another  that is not my name  i am ernest defarge  

 it is all the same   said the spy  airily  but discomfited too   good
day  

 good day   answered defarge  drily 

 i was saying to madame  with whom i had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered  that they tell me there is  and no wonder   much sympathy
and anger in saint antoine  touching the unhappy fate of poor gaspard  

 no one has told me so   said defarge  shaking his head   i know nothing
of it  

having said it  he passed behind the little counter  and stood with his
hand on the back of his wife   chair  looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed  and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction 

the spy  well used to his business  did not change his unconscious
attitude  but drained his little glass of cognac  took a sip of fresh
water  and asked for another glass of cognac  madame defarge poured it
out for him  took to her knitting again  and hummed a little song over
it 

 you seem to know this quarter well  that is to say  better than i do  
observed defarge 

 not at all  but i hope to know it better  i am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants  

 hah   muttered defarge 

 the pleasure of conversing with you  monsieur defarge  recalls to me  
pursued the spy   that i have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name  

 indeed   said defarge  with much indifference 

 yes  indeed  when doctor manette was released  you  his old domestic 
had the charge of him  i know  he was delivered to you  you see i am
informed of the circumstances  

 such is the fact  certainly   said defarge  he had had it conveyed
to him  in an accidental touch of his wife   elbow as she knitted and
warbled  that he would do best to answer  but always with brevity 

 it was to you   said the spy   that his daughter came  and it was
from your care that his daughter took him  accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur  how is he called   in a little wig  lorry  of the bank of
tellson and company  over to england  

 such is the fact   repeated defarge 

 very interesting remembrances   said the spy   i have known doctor
manette and his daughter  in england  

 yes   said defarge 

 you don   hear much about them now   said the spy 

 no   said defarge 

 in effect   madame struck in  looking up from her work and her little
song   we never hear about them  we received the news of their safe
arrival  and perhaps another letter  or perhaps two  but  since then 
they have gradually taken their road in life  we  ours  and we have held
no correspondence  

 perfectly so  madame   replied the spy   she is going to be married  

 going   echoed madame   she was pretty enough to have been married long
ago  you english are cold  it seems to me  

 oh  you know i am english  

 i perceive your tongue is   returned madame   and what the tongue is  i
suppose the man is  

he did not take the identification as a compliment  but he made the best
of it  and turned it off with a laugh  after sipping his cognac to the
end  he added 

 yes  miss manette is going to be married  but not to an englishman  to
one who  like herself  is french by birth  and speaking of gaspard  ah 
poor gaspard  it was cruel  cruel    it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis  for whom gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet  in other words  the present
marquis  but he lives unknown in england  he is no marquis there  he is
mr  charles darnay    aulnais is the name of his mother   family  

madame defarge knitted steadily  but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband  do what he would  behind the little counter 
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe  he was
troubled  and his hand was not trustworthy  the spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it  or to record it in his mind 

having made  at least  this one hit  whatever it might prove to be
worth  and no customers coming in to help him to any other  mr  barsad
paid for what he had drunk  and took his leave  taking occasion to say 
in a genteel manner  before he departed  that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame defarge again  for some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of saint antoine  the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them  lest he should
come back 

 can it be true   said defarge  in a low voice  looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair   what he has
said of ma amselle manette  

 as he has said it   returned madame  lifting her eyebrows a little   it
is probably false  but it may be true  

 if it is    defarge began  and stopped 

 if it is   repeated his wife 

   and if it does come  while we live to see it triumph  i hope  for her
sake  destiny will keep her husband out of france  

 her husband   destiny   said madame defarge  with her usual composure 
 will take him where he is to go  and will lead him to the end that is
to end him  that is all i know  

 but it is very strange  now  at least  is it not very strange   said
defarge  rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it 
 that  after all our sympathy for monsieur her father  and herself  her
husband   name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment  by
the side of that infernal dog   who has just left us  

 stranger things than that will happen when it does come   answered
madame   i have them both here  of a certainty  and they are both here
for their merits  that is enough  

she rolled up her knitting when she had said those words  and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head 
either saint antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone  or saint antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance  howbeit  the saint took courage to lounge in  very
shortly afterwards  and the wine shop recovered its habitual aspect 

in the evening  at which season of all others saint antoine turned
himself inside out  and sat on door steps and window ledges  and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts  for a breath of air  madame
defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group  a missionary  there were many like
her  such as the world will do well never to breed again  all the women
knitted  they knitted worthless things  but  the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking  the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus  if the bony fingers had been still 
the stomachs would have been more famine pinched 

but  as the fingers went  the eyes went  and the thoughts  and as madame
defarge moved on from group to group  all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with  and left
behind 

her husband smoked at his door  looking after her with admiration   a
great woman   said he   a strong woman  a grand woman  a frightfully
grand woman  

darkness closed around  and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the palace courtyard  as
the women sat knitting  knitting  darkness encompassed them  another
darkness was closing in as surely  when the church bells  then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over france  should be melted into
thundering cannon  when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice  that night all potent as the voice of power and plenty 
freedom and life  so much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting  knitting  that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt  where they were to sit knitting  knitting 
counting dropping heads 




xvii  one night


never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
soho  than one memorable evening when the doctor and his daughter sat
under the plane tree together  never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great london  than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree  and shone upon their faces through its leaves 

lucie was to be married to morrow  she had reserved this last evening
for her father  and they sat alone under the plane tree 

 you are happy  my dear father  

 quite  my child  

they had said little  though they had been there a long time  when it
was yet light enough to work and read  she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work  nor had she read to him  she had employed herself in
both ways  at his side under the tree  many and many a time  but  this
time was not quite like any other  and nothing could make it so 

 and i am very happy to night  dear father  i am deeply happy in the
love that heaven has so blessed  my love for charles  and charles   love
for me  but  if my life were not to be still consecrated to you  or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us  even by
the length of a few of these streets  i should be more unhappy and
self reproachful now than i can tell you  even as it is   

even as it was  she could not command her voice 

in the sad moonlight  she clasped him by the neck  and laid her face
upon his breast  in the moonlight which is always sad  as the light of
the sun itself is  as the light called human life is  at its coming and
its going 

 dearest dear  can you tell me  this last time  that you feel quite 
quite sure  no new affections of mine  and no new duties of mine  will
ever interpose between us   i  know it well  but do you know it  in your
own heart  do you feel quite certain  

her father answered  with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed   quite sure  my darling  more than that   he
added  as he tenderly kissed her   my future is far brighter  lucie 
seen through your marriage  than it could have been  nay  than it ever
was  without it  

 if i could hope  that   my father    

 believe it  love  indeed it is so  consider how natural and how plain
it is  my dear  that it should be so  you  devoted and young  cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety i have felt that your life should not be
wasted   

she moved her hand towards his lips  but he took it in his  and repeated
the word 

   wasted  my child  should not be wasted  struck aside from the
natural order of things  for my sake  your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this  but  only ask yourself 
how could my happiness be perfect  while yours was incomplete  

 if i had never seen charles  my father  i should have been quite happy
with you  

he smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without charles  having seen him  and replied 

 my child  you did see him  and it is charles  if it had not been
charles  it would have been another  or  if it had been no other  i
should have been the cause  and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself  and would have fallen on you  

it was the first time  except at the trial  of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering  it gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears  and she remembered it long
afterwards 

 see   said the doctor of beauvais  raising his hand towards the moon 
 i have looked at her from my prison window  when i could not bear her
light  i have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what i had lost  that i have beaten my head against
my prison walls  i have looked at her  in a state so dull and lethargic 
that i have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines i
could draw across her at the full  and the number of perpendicular lines
with which i could intersect them   he added in his inward and pondering
manner  as he looked at the moon   it was twenty either way  i remember 
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in  

the strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time 
deepened as he dwelt upon it  but  there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference  he only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over 

 i have looked at her  speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom i had been rent  whether it was alive  whether it had
been born alive  or the poor mother   shock had killed it  whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father   there was a time in my
imprisonment  when my desire for vengeance was unbearable   whether it
was a son who would never know his father   story  who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his father   having disappeared of his own
will and act  whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman  

she drew closer to him  and kissed his cheek and his hand 

 i have pictured my daughter  to myself  as perfectly forgetful of
me  rather  altogether ignorant of me  and unconscious of me  i have
cast up the years of her age  year after year  i have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate  i have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living  and in the next generation my place was a
blank  

 my father  even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed  strikes to my heart as if i had been that child  

 you  lucie  it is out of the consolation and restoration you have
brought to me  that these remembrances arise  and pass between us and
the moon on this last night   what did i say just now  

 she knew nothing of you  she cared nothing for you  

 so  but on other moonlight nights  when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way  have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace  as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could  i have imagined her as coming to me in my cell  and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress  i have seen her
image in the moonlight often  as i now see you  except that i never held
her in my arms  it stood between the little grated window and the door 
but  you understand that that was not the child i am speaking of  

 the figure was not  the  the  image  the fancy  

 no  that was another thing  it stood before my disturbed sense of
sight  but it never moved  the phantom that my mind pursued  was another
and more real child  of her outward appearance i know no more than
that she was like her mother  the other had that likeness too  as you
have  but was not the same  can you follow me  lucie  hardly  i think 
i doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions  

his collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold  as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition 

 in that more peaceful state  i have imagined her  in the moonlight 
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father  my picture
was in her room  and i was in her prayers  her life was active 
cheerful  useful  but my poor history pervaded it all  

 i was that child  my father  i was not half so good  but in my love
that was i  

 and she showed me her children   said the doctor of beauvais   and
they had heard of me  and had been taught to pity me  when they passed
a prison of the state  they kept far from its frowning walls  and looked
up at its bars  and spoke in whispers  she could never deliver me  i
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things 
but then  blessed with the relief of tears  i fell upon my knees  and
blessed her  

 i am that child  i hope  my father  o my dear  my dear  will you bless
me as fervently to morrow  

 lucie  i recall these old troubles in the reason that i have to night
for loving you better than words can tell  and thanking god for my great
happiness  my thoughts  when they were wildest  never rose near the
happiness that i have known with you  and that we have before us  

he embraced her  solemnly commended her to heaven  and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him  by and bye  they went into the
house 

there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr  lorry  there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross  the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence  they had been able to extend it 
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger  and they desired nothing more 

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper  they were only
three at table  and miss pross made the third  he regretted that charles
was not there  was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away  and drank to him affectionately 

so  the time came for him to bid lucie good night  and they separated 
but  in the stillness of the third hour of the morning  lucie came
downstairs again  and stole into his room  not free from unshaped fears 
beforehand 

all things  however  were in their places  all was quiet  and he lay
asleep  his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow  and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet  she put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance  crept up to his bed  and put her lips to his 
then  leaned over him  and looked at him 

into his handsome face  the bitter waters of captivity had worn  but  he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong  that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep  a more remarkable face in its quiet 
resolute  and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant  was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep  that night 

she timidly laid her hand on his dear breast  and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be  and as his
sorrows deserved  then  she withdrew her hand  and kissed his lips once
more  and went away  so  the sunrise came  and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane tree moved upon his face  as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him 




xviii  nine days


the marriage day was shining brightly  and they were ready outside the
closed door of the doctor   room  where he was speaking with charles
darnay  they were ready to go to church  the beautiful bride  mr 
lorry  and miss pross  to whom the event  through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable  would have been one of absolute bliss 
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should
have been the bridegroom 

 and so   said mr  lorry  who could not sufficiently admire the bride 
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet 
pretty dress   and so it was for this  my sweet lucie  that i brought
you across the channel  such a baby  lord bless me  how little i thought
what i was doing  how lightly i valued the obligation i was conferring
on my friend mr  charles  

 you didn   mean it   remarked the matter of fact miss pross   and
therefore how could you know it  nonsense  

 really  well  but don   cry   said the gentle mr  lorry 

 i am not crying   said miss pross    you  are  

 i  my pross    by this time  mr  lorry dared to be pleasant with her 
on occasion  

 you were  just now  i saw you do it  and i don   wonder at it  such
a present of plate as you have made  em  is enough to bring tears into
anybody   eyes  there   not a fork or a spoon in the collection   said
miss pross   that i didn   cry over  last night after the box came  till
i couldn   see it  

 i am highly gratified   said mr  lorry   though  upon my honour  i
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one  dear me  this is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost  dear  dear  dear  to think that there
might have been a mrs  lorry  any time these fifty years almost  

 not at all   from miss pross 

 you think there never might have been a mrs  lorry   asked the
gentleman of that name 

 pooh   rejoined miss pross   you were a bachelor in your cradle  

 well   observed mr  lorry  beamingly adjusting his little wig   that
seems probable  too  

 and you were cut out for a bachelor   pursued miss pross   before you
were put in your cradle  

 then  i think   said mr  lorry   that i was very unhandsomely dealt
with  and that i ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern  enough  now  my dear lucie   drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist   i hear them moving in the next room  and miss pross and
i  as two formal folks of business  are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear  you leave
your good father  my dear  in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own  he shall be taken every conceivable care of  during the next
fortnight  while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts  even tellson  
shall go to the wall  comparatively speaking  before him  and when  at
the fortnight   end  he comes to join you and your beloved husband  on
your other fortnight   trip in wales  you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame  now  i hear
somebody   step coming to the door  let me kiss my dear girl with an
old fashioned bachelor blessing  before somebody comes to claim his
own  

for a moment  he held the fair face from him to look at the
well remembered expression on the forehead  and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig  with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which  if such things be old fashioned  were as old as adam 

the door of the doctor   room opened  and he came out with charles
darnay  he was so deadly pale  which had not been the case when they
went in together  that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face 
but  in the composure of his manner he was unaltered  except that to the
shrewd glance of mr  lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him  like a cold
wind 

he gave his arm to his daughter  and took her down stairs to the chariot
which mr  lorry had hired in honour of the day  the rest followed in
another carriage  and soon  in a neighbouring church  where no strange
eyes looked on  charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married 

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done  some diamonds  very bright and sparkling 
glanced on the bride   hand  which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of mr  lorry   pockets  they returned home to
breakfast  and all went well  and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker   white locks in the paris garret  were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight  on the threshold of the
door at parting 

it was a hard parting  though it was not for long  but her father
cheered her  and said at last  gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms   take her  charles  she is yours  

and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window  and she was
gone 

the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious  and the
preparations having been very simple and few  the doctor  mr  lorry 
and miss pross  were left quite alone  it was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall  that mr  lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor  as if the golden arm uplifted
there  had struck him a poisoned blow 

he had naturally repressed much  and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone  but  it was
the old scared lost look that troubled mr  lorry  and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up stairs  mr  lorry was reminded of defarge the
wine shop keeper  and the starlight ride 

 i think   he whispered to miss pross  after anxious consideration   i
think we had best not speak to him just now  or at all disturb him 
i must look in at tellson    so i will go there at once and come back
presently  then  we will take him a ride into the country  and dine
there  and all will be well  

it was easier for mr  lorry to look in at tellson    than to look out of
tellson    he was detained two hours  when he came back  he ascended the
old staircase alone  having asked no question of the servant  going thus
into the doctor   rooms  he was stopped by a low sound of knocking 

 good god   he said  with a start   what   that  

miss pross  with a terrified face  was at his ear   o me  o me  all is
lost   cried she  wringing her hands   what is to be told to ladybird 
he doesn   know me  and is making shoes  

mr  lorry said what he could to calm her  and went himself into the
doctor   room  the bench was turned towards the light  as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before  and his head was bent
down  and he was very busy 

 doctor manette  my dear friend  doctor manette  

the doctor looked at him for a moment  half inquiringly  half as if he
were angry at being spoken to  and bent over his work again 

he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat  his shirt was open at the
throat  as it used to be when he did that work  and even the old
haggard  faded surface of face had come back to him  he worked
hard  impatiently  as if in some sense of having been interrupted 

mr  lorry glanced at the work in his hand  and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape  he took up another that was lying by
him  and asked what it was 

 a young lady   walking shoe   he muttered  without looking up   it
ought to have been finished long ago  let it be  

 but  doctor manette  look at me  

he obeyed  in the old mechanically submissive manner  without pausing in
his work 

 you know me  my dear friend  think again  this is not your proper
occupation  think  dear friend  

nothing would induce him to speak more  he looked up  for an instant at
a time  when he was requested to do so  but  no persuasion would extract
a word from him  he worked  and worked  and worked  in silence  and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall  or on
the air  the only ray of hope that mr  lorry could discover  was  that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked  in that  there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity  as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind 

two things at once impressed themselves on mr  lorry  as important above
all others  the first  that this must be kept secret from lucie 
the second  that it must be kept secret from all who knew him  in
conjunction with miss pross  he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution  by giving out that the doctor was not well  and required a
few days of complete rest  in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter  miss pross was to write  describing his having been
called away professionally  and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand  represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post 

these measures  advisable to be taken in any case  mr  lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself  if that should happen soon  he kept
another course in reserve  which was  to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best  on the doctor   case 

in the hope of his recovery  and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable  mr  lorry resolved to watch him
attentively  with as little appearance as possible of doing so  he
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson   for the
first time in his life  and took his post by the window in the same
room 

he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him  since  on being pressed  he became worried  he abandoned that
attempt on the first day  and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him  as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen  or was falling  he remained  therefore  in his seat near the
window  reading and writing  and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of  that it was a free place 

doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink  and worked on 
that first day  until it was too dark to see  worked on  half an hour
after mr  lorry could not have seen  for his life  to read or write 
when he put his tools aside as useless  until morning  mr  lorry rose
and said to him 

 will you go out  

he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner 
looked up in the old manner  and repeated in the old low voice 

 out  

 yes  for a walk with me  why not  

he made no effort to say why not  and said not a word more  but  mr 
lorry thought he saw  as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk 
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands  that he was in
some misty way asking himself   why not   the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here  and determined to hold it 

miss pross and he divided the night into two watches  and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room  he paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down  but  when he did finally lay himself down  he
fell asleep  in the morning  he was up betimes  and went straight to his
bench and to work 

on this second day  mr  lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name 
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them  he
returned no reply  but it was evident that he heard what was said  and
that he thought about it  however confusedly  this encouraged mr  lorry
to have miss pross in with her work  several times during the day 
at those times  they quietly spoke of lucie  and of her father then
present  precisely in the usual manner  and as if there were nothing
amiss  this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment  not long
enough  or often enough to harass him  and it lightened mr  lorry  
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener  and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him 

when it fell dark again  mr  lorry asked him as before 

 dear doctor  will you go out  

as before  he repeated   out  

 yes  for a walk with me  why not  

this time  mr  lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him  and  after remaining absent for an hour  returned  in the
meanwhile  the doctor had removed to the seat in the window  and had
sat there looking down at the plane tree  but  on mr  lorry   return  he
slipped away to his bench 

the time went very slowly on  and mr  lorry   hope darkened  and his
heart grew heavier again  and grew yet heavier and heavier every day 
the third day came and went  the fourth  the fifth  five days  six days 
seven days  eight days  nine days 

with a hope ever darkening  and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier  mr  lorry passed through this anxious time  the secret was
well kept  and lucie was unconscious and happy  but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker  whose hand had been a little out at first 
was growing dreadfully skilful  and that he had never been so intent on
his work  and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert  as in
the dusk of the ninth evening 




xix  an opinion


worn out by anxious watching  mr  lorry fell asleep at his post  on the
tenth morning of his suspense  he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night 

he rubbed his eyes and roused himself  but he doubted  when he had
done so  whether he was not still asleep  for  going to the door of the
doctor   room and looking in  he perceived that the shoemaker   bench
and tools were put aside again  and that the doctor himself sat reading
at the window  he was in his usual morning dress  and his face  which
mr  lorry could distinctly see   though still very pale  was calmly
studious and attentive 

even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake  mr  lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own  for  did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect  and employed
as usual  and was there any sign within their range  that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened 

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment  the
answer being obvious  if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause  how came he  jarvis lorry  there 
how came he to have fallen asleep  in his clothes  on the sofa in doctor
manette   consulting room  and to be debating these points outside the
doctor   bedroom door in the early morning 

within a few minutes  miss pross stood whispering at his side  if he
had had any particle of doubt left  her talk would of necessity have
resolved it  but he was by that time clear headed  and had none 
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast hour  and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred  if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind  mr 
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been  in his anxiety  so anxious to obtain 

miss pross  submitting herself to his judgment  the scheme was worked
out with care  having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette  mr  lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual
white linen  and with his usual neat leg  the doctor was summoned in the
usual way  and came to breakfast 

so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which mr  lorry felt to be the only safe
advance  he at first supposed that his daughter   marriage had taken
place yesterday  an incidental allusion  purposely thrown out  to
the day of the week  and the day of the month  set him thinking and
counting  and evidently made him uneasy  in all other respects  however 
he was so composedly himself  that mr  lorry determined to have the aid
he sought  and that aid was his own 

therefore  when the breakfast was done and cleared away  and he and the
doctor were left together  mr  lorry said  feelingly 

 my dear manette  i am anxious to have your opinion  in confidence  on a
very curious case in which i am deeply interested  that is to say  it is
very curious to me  perhaps  to your better information it may be less
so  

glancing at his hands  which were discoloured by his late work  the
doctor looked troubled  and listened attentively  he had already glanced
at his hands more than once 

 doctor manette   said mr  lorry  touching him affectionately on the
arm   the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine  pray
give your mind to it  and advise me well for his sake  and above all 
for his daughter    his daughter    my dear manette  

 if i understand   said the doctor  in a subdued tone   some mental
shock    

 yes  

 be explicit   said the doctor   spare no detail  

mr  lorry saw that they understood one another  and proceeded 

 my dear manette  it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock 
of great acuteness and severity to the affections  the feelings 
the  the  as you express it  the mind  the mind  it is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down  one cannot say for how
long  because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself  and there
are no other means of getting at it  it is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered  by a process that he cannot trace
himself  as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner  it is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered  so completely  as to
be a highly intelligent man  capable of close application of mind  and
great exertion of body  and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge  which was already very large  but  unfortunately 
there has been   he paused and took a deep breath   a slight relapse  

the doctor  in a low voice  asked   of how long duration  

 nine days and nights  

 how did it show itself  i infer   glancing at his hands again   in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock  

 that is the fact  

 now  did you ever see him   asked the doctor  distinctly and
collectedly  though in the same low voice   engaged in that pursuit
originally  

 once  

 and when the relapse fell on him  was he in most respects  or in all
respects  as he was then  

 i think in all respects  

 you spoke of his daughter  does his daughter know of the relapse  

 no  it has been kept from her  and i hope will always be kept from her 
it is known only to myself  and to one other who may be trusted  

the doctor grasped his hand  and murmured   that was very kind  that was
very thoughtful   mr  lorry grasped his hand in return  and neither of
the two spoke for a little while 

 now  my dear manette   said mr  lorry  at length  in his most
considerate and most affectionate way   i am a mere man of business 
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters  i do not
possess the kind of information necessary  i do not possess the kind of
intelligence  i want guiding  there is no man in this world on whom
i could so rely for right guidance  as on you  tell me  how does this
relapse come about  is there danger of another  could a repetition of it
be prevented  how should a repetition of it be treated  how does it come
about at all  what can i do for my friend  no man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend  than i am to serve mine 
if i knew how 

 but i don   know how to originate  in such a case  if your sagacity 
knowledge  and experience  could put me on the right track  i might be
able to do so much  unenlightened and undirected  i can do so little 
pray discuss it with me  pray enable me to see it a little more clearly 
and teach me how to be a little more useful  

doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken  and
mr  lorry did not press him 

 i think it probable   said the doctor  breaking silence with an effort 
 that the relapse you have described  my dear friend  was not quite
unforeseen by its subject  

 was it dreaded by him   mr  lorry ventured to ask 

 very much   he said it with an involuntary shudder 

 you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer  
mind  and how difficult  how almost impossible  it is  for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him  

 would he   asked mr  lorry   be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one  when it is on
him  

 i think so  but it is  as i have told you  next to impossible  i even
believe it  in some cases  to be quite impossible  

 now   said mr  lorry  gently laying his hand on the doctor   arm again 
after a short silence on both sides   to what would you refer this
attack  

 i believe   returned doctor manette   that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady  some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled  i think  it is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind  that those associations
would be recalled  say  under certain circumstances  say  on a
particular occasion  he tried to prepare himself in vain  perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it  

 would he remember what took place in the relapse   asked mr  lorry 
with natural hesitation 

the doctor looked desolately round the room  shook his head  and
answered  in a low voice   not at all  

 now  as to the future   hinted mr  lorry 

 as to the future   said the doctor  recovering firmness   i should have
great hope  as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon  i
should have great hope  he  yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something  long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against 
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed  i should hope that
the worst was over  

 well  well  that   good comfort  i am thankful   said mr  lorry 

 i am thankful   repeated the doctor  bending his head with reverence 

 there are two other points   said mr  lorry   on which i am anxious to
be instructed  i may go on  

 you cannot do your friend a better service   the doctor gave him his
hand 

 to the first  then  he is of a studious habit  and unusually energetic 
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge  to the conducting of experiments  to many things  now  does
he do too much  

 i think not  it may be the character of his mind  to be always in
singular need of occupation  that may be  in part  natural to it  in
part  the result of affliction  the less it was occupied with healthy
things  the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction  he may have observed himself  and made the discovery  

 you are sure that he is not under too great a strain  

 i think i am quite sure of it  

 my dear manette  if he were overworked now   

 my dear lorry  i doubt if that could easily be  there has been a
violent stress in one direction  and it needs a counterweight  

 excuse me  as a persistent man of business  assuming for a moment 
that he  was  overworked  it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder  

 i do not think so  i do not think   said doctor manette with the
firmness of self conviction   that anything but the one train of
association would renew it  i think that  henceforth  nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it  after what has
happened  and after his recovery  i find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again  i trust  and i almost
believe  that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted  

he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind  and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress  it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence  he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was  and approached his second and last point  he felt it to
be the most difficult of all  but  remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross  and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days  he knew that he must face it 

 the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from   said mr  lorry  clearing his throat   we
will call  blacksmith   work  blacksmith   work  we will say  to put a
case and for the sake of illustration  that he had been used  in his bad
time  to work at a little forge  we will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again  is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him  

the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand  and beat his foot
nervously on the ground 

 he has always kept it by him   said mr  lorry  with an anxious look at
his friend   now  would it not be better that he should let it go  

still  the doctor  with shaded forehead  beat his foot nervously on the
ground 

 you do not find it easy to advise me   said mr  lorry   i quite
understand it to be a nice question  and yet i think    and there he
shook his head  and stopped 

 you see   said doctor manette  turning to him after an uneasy pause 
 it is very hard to explain  consistently  the innermost workings
of this poor man   mind  he once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation  and it was so welcome when it came  no doubt it relieved
his pain so much  by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain  and by substituting  as he became more
practised  the ingenuity of the hands  for the ingenuity of the mental
torture  that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach  even now  when i believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been  and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence  the idea that he might need that old employment  and not
find it  gives him a sudden sense of terror  like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child  

he looked like his illustration  as he raised his eyes to mr  lorry  
face 

 but may not  mind  i ask for information  as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas  shillings  and
bank notes  may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea  if the thing were gone  my dear manette  might not the fear go
with it  in short  is it not a concession to the misgiving  to keep the
forge  

there was another silence 

 you see  too   said the doctor  tremulously   it is such an old
companion  

 i would not keep it   said mr  lorry  shaking his head  for he gained
in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted   i would recommend him to
sacrifice it  i only want your authority  i am sure it does no good 
come  give me your authority  like a dear good man  for his daughter  
sake  my dear manette  

very strange to see what a struggle there was within him 

 in her name  then  let it be done  i sanction it  but  i would not take
it away while he was present  let it be removed when he is not there 
let him miss his old companion after an absence  

mr  lorry readily engaged for that  and the conference was ended  they
passed the day in the country  and the doctor was quite restored  on the
three following days he remained perfectly well  and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband  the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence  mr  lorry had previously
explained to him  and he had written to lucie in accordance with it  and
she had no suspicions 

on the night of the day on which he left the house  mr  lorry went into
his room with a chopper  saw  chisel  and hammer  attended by miss pross
carrying a light  there  with closed doors  and in a mysterious and
guilty manner  mr  lorry hacked the shoemaker   bench to pieces  while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder  for
which  indeed  in her grimness  she was no unsuitable figure  the
burning of the body  previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose  was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire  and the tools 
shoes  and leather  were buried in the garden  so wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds  that mr  lorry and miss pross 
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces  almost felt  and almost looked  like accomplices in a horrible
crime 




xx  a plea


when the newly married pair came home  the first person who appeared  to
offer his congratulations  was sydney carton  they had not been at home
many hours  when he presented himself  he was not improved in habits  or
in looks  or in manner  but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him  which was new to the observation of charles darnay 

he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window  and of
speaking to him when no one overheard 

 mr  darnay   said carton   i wish we might be friends  

 we are already friends  i hope  

 you are good enough to say so  as a fashion of speech  but  i don  
mean any fashion of speech  indeed  when i say i wish we might be
friends  i scarcely mean quite that  either  

charles darnay  as was natural  asked him  in all good humour and
good fellowship  what he did mean 

 upon my life   said carton  smiling   i find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind  than to convey to yours  however  let me try  you
remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than  than
usual  

 i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking  

 i remember it too  the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me  for i
always remember them  i hope it may be taken into account one day 
when all days are at an end for me  don   be alarmed  i am not going to
preach  

 i am not at all alarmed  earnestness in you  is anything but alarming
to me  

 ah   said carton  with a careless wave of his hand  as if he waved that
away   on the drunken occasion in question  one of a large number  as
you know   i was insufferable about liking you  and not liking you  i
wish you would forget it  

 i forgot it long ago  

 fashion of speech again  but  mr  darnay  oblivion is not so easy to
me  as you represent it to be to you  i have by no means forgotten it 
and a light answer does not help me to forget it  

 if it was a light answer   returned darnay   i beg your forgiveness
for it  i had no other object than to turn a slight thing  which  to my
surprise  seems to trouble you too much  aside  i declare to you  on the
faith of a gentleman  that i have long dismissed it from my mind  good
heaven  what was there to dismiss  have i had nothing more important to
remember  in the great service you rendered me that day  

 as to the great service   said carton   i am bound to avow to you  when
you speak of it in that way  that it was mere professional claptrap  i
don   know that i cared what became of you  when i rendered it   mind  i
say when i rendered it  i am speaking of the past  

 you make light of the obligation   returned darnay   but i will not
quarrel with  your  light answer  

 genuine truth  mr  darnay  trust me  i have gone aside from my purpose 
i was speaking about our being friends  now  you know me  you know i am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men  if you doubt it 
ask stryver  and he ll tell you so  

 i prefer to form my own opinion  without the aid of his  

 well  at any rate you know me as a dissolute dog  who has never done
any good  and never will  

 i don   know that you  never will   

 but i do  and you must take my word for it  well  if you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow  and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation  coming and going at odd times  i should ask that i might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here  that i might
be regarded as an useless  and i would add  if it were not for the
resemblance i detected between you and me  an unornamental  piece of
furniture  tolerated for its old service  and taken no notice of  i
doubt if i should abuse the permission  it is a hundred to one if i
should avail myself of it four times in a year  it would satisfy me  i
dare say  to know that i had it  

 will you try  

 that is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have
indicated  i thank you  darnay  i may use that freedom with your name  

 i think so  carton  by this time  

they shook hands upon it  and sydney turned away  within a minute
afterwards  he was  to all outward appearance  as unsubstantial as ever 

when he was gone  and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross  the doctor  and mr  lorry  charles darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms  and spoke of sydney carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness  he spoke of him  in short  not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him  but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself 

he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife  but  when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms  he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked 

 we are thoughtful to night   said darnay  drawing his arm about her 

 yes  dearest charles   with her hands on his breast  and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him   we are rather thoughtful
to night  for we have something on our mind to night  

 what is it  my lucie  

 will you promise not to press one question on me  if i beg you not to
ask it  

 will i promise  what will i not promise to my love  

what  indeed  with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek  and his other hand against the heart that beat for him 

 i think  charles  poor mr  carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to night  

 indeed  my own  why so  

 that is what you are not to ask me  but i think  i know  he does  

 if you know it  it is enough  what would you have me do  my life  

 i would ask you  dearest  to be very generous with him always  and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by  i would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very  very seldom reveals  and that there are deep
wounds in it  my dear  i have seen it bleeding  

 it is a painful reflection to me   said charles darnay  quite
astounded   that i should have done him any wrong  i never thought this
of him  

 my husband  it is so  i fear he is not to be reclaimed  there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now  but  i am sure that he is capable of good things  gentle things 
even magnanimous things  

she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man 
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours 

 and  o my dearest love   she urged  clinging nearer to him  laying her
head upon his breast  and raising her eyes to his   remember how strong
we are in our happiness  and how weak he is in his misery  

the supplication touched him home   i will always remember it  dear
heart  i will remember it as long as i live  

he bent over the golden head  and put the rosy lips to his  and folded
her in his arms  if one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets 
could have heard her innocent disclosure  and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband  he might have cried to the night  and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time  

 god bless her for her sweet compassion  




xxi  echoing footsteps


a wonderful corner for echoes  it has been remarked  that corner where
the doctor lived  ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband  and her father  and herself  and her old directress and
companion  in a life of quiet bliss  lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner  listening to the echoing footsteps of
years 

at first  there were times  though she was a perfectly happy young wife 
when her work would slowly fall from her hands  and her eyes would be
dimmed  for  there was something coming in the echoes  something light 
afar off  and scarcely audible yet  that stirred her heart too much 
fluttering hopes and doubts  hopes  of a love as yet unknown to her 
doubts  of her remaining upon earth  to enjoy that new delight  divided
her breast  among the echoes then  there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave  and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate  and who would mourn for her so much  swelled to her
eyes  and broke like waves 

that time passed  and her little lucie lay on her bosom  then  among the
advancing echoes  there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words  let greater echoes resound as they would  the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming  they came  and
the shady house was sunny with a child   laugh  and the divine friend of
children  to whom in her trouble she had confided hers  seemed to take
her child in his arms  as he took the child of old  and made it a sacred
joy to her 

ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together 
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives  and making it predominate nowhere  lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds  her husband  
step was strong and prosperous among them  her father   firm and equal 
lo  miss pross  in harness of string  awakening the echoes  as an
unruly charger  whip corrected  snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane tree in the garden 

even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest  they were not
harsh nor cruel  even when golden hair  like her own  lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy  and he said  with a radiant
smile   dear papa and mamma  i am very sorry to leave you both  and to
leave my pretty sister  but i am called  and i must go   those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mother   cheek  as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it  suffer them and
forbid them not  they see my father   face  o father  blessed words 

thus  the rustling of an angel   wings got blended with the other
echoes  and they were not wholly of earth  but had in them that breath
of heaven  sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden tomb were
mingled with them also  and both were audible to lucie  in a hushed
murmur  like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore  as
the little lucie  comically studious at the task of the morning  or
dressing a doll at her mother   footstool  chattered in the tongues of
the two cities that were blended in her life 

the echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of sydney carton  some
half dozen times a year  at most  he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited  and would sit among them through the evening  as he had once
done often  he never came there heated with wine  and one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes  which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages 

no man ever really loved a woman  lost her  and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind  when she was a wife and a mother 
but her children had a strange sympathy with him  an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him  what fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case  no echoes tell  but it is so  and it was so here  carton
was the first stranger to whom little lucie held out her chubby arms 
and he kept his place with her as she grew  the little boy had spoken of
him  almost at the last   poor carton  kiss him for me  

mr  stryver shouldered his way through the law  like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water  and dragged his useful friend in
his wake  like a boat towed astern  as the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight  and mostly under water  so  sydney had a swamped
life of it  but  easy and strong custom  unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace  made
it the life he was to lead  and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion   jackal  than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion  stryver was rich  had married a florid widow with
property and three boys  who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads 

these three young gentlemen  mr  stryver  exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore  had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in soho  and had offered as pupils to
lucie   husband  delicately saying  halloa  here are three lumps of
bread and cheese towards your matrimonial picnic  darnay   the polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread and cheese had quite bloated mr 
stryver with indignation  which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen  by directing them to beware of the
pride of beggars  like that tutor fellow  he was also in the habit of
declaiming to mrs  stryver  over his full bodied wine  on the arts
mrs  darnay had once put in practice to  catch  him  and on the
diamond cut diamond arts in himself  madam  which had rendered him  not
to be caught   some of his king   bench familiars  who were occasionally
parties to the full bodied wine and the lie  excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often  that he believed
it himself  which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence  as to justify any such offender   being carried
off to some suitably retired spot  and there hanged out of the way 

these were among the echoes to which lucie  sometimes pensive  sometimes
amused and laughing  listened in the echoing corner  until her little
daughter was six years old  how near to her heart the echoes of her
child   tread came  and those of her own dear father    always active
and self possessed  and those of her dear husband    need not be told 
nor  how the lightest echo of their united home  directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste  was music to her  nor  how there were echoes all about her  sweet
in her ears  of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married  if that could be  than single  and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him  and asked her  what is
the magic secret  my darling  of your being everything to all of us 
as if there were only one of us  yet never seeming to be hurried  or to
have too much to do  

but  there were other echoes  from a distance  that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time  and it was now  about
little lucie   sixth birthday  that they began to have an awful sound 
as of a great storm in france with a dreadful sea rising 

on a night in mid july  one thousand seven hundred and eighty nine  mr 
lorry came in late  from tellson    and sat himself down by lucie and
her husband in the dark window  it was a hot  wild night  and they were
all three reminded of the old sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place 

 i began to think   said mr  lorry  pushing his brown wig back   that
i should have to pass the night at tellson    we have been so full of
business all day  that we have not known what to do first  or which way
to turn  there is such an uneasiness in paris  that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us  our customers over there  seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough  there is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to england  

 that has a bad look   said darnay  

 a bad look  you say  my dear darnay  yes  but we don   know what reason
there is in it  people are so unreasonable  some of us at tellson   are
getting old  and we really can   be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion  

 still   said darnay   you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is  

 i know that  to be sure   assented mr  lorry  trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured  and that he grumbled   but i
am determined to be peevish after my long day   botheration  where is
manette  

 here he is   said the doctor  entering the dark room at the moment 

 i am quite glad you are at home  for these hurries and forebodings by
which i have been surrounded all day long  have made me nervous without
reason  you are not going out  i hope  

 no  i am going to play backgammon with you  if you like   said the
doctor 

 i don   think i do like  if i may speak my mind  i am not fit to be
pitted against you to night  is the teaboard still there  lucie  i can  
see  

 of course  it has been kept for you  

 thank ye  my dear  the precious child is safe in bed  

 and sleeping soundly  

 that   right  all safe and well  i don   know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here  thank god  but i have been so put out
all day  and i am not as young as i was  my tea  my dear  thank ye  now 
come and take your place in the circle  and let us sit quiet  and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory  

 not a theory  it was a fancy  

 a fancy  then  my wise pet   said mr  lorry  patting her hand   they
are very numerous and very loud  though  are they not  only hear them  

headlong  mad  and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody  
life  footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red  the
footsteps raging in saint antoine afar off  as the little circle sat in
the dark london window 

saint antoine had been  that morning  a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro  with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads  where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun  a tremendous
roar arose from the throat of saint antoine  and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind 
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below  no matter how far off 

who gave them out  whence they last came  where they began  through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked  scores at a time  over the
heads of the crowd  like a kind of lightning  no eye in the throng could
have told  but  muskets were being distributed  so were cartridges 
powder  and ball  bars of iron and wood  knives  axes  pikes  every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise  people who
could lay hold of nothing else  set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls  every pulse and
heart in saint antoine was on high fever strain and at high fever heat 
every living creature there held life as of no account  and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it 

as a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point  so  all this raging
circled round defarge   wine shop  and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where defarge himself 
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat  issued orders  issued arms 
thrust this man back  dragged this man forward  disarmed one to arm
another  laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar 

 keep near to me  jacques three   cried defarge   and do you  jacques
one and two  separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can  where is my wife  

 eh  well  here you see me   said madame  composed as ever  but not
knitting to day  madame   resolute right hand was occupied with an axe 
in place of the usual softer implements  and in her girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife 

 where do you go  my wife  

 i go   said madame   with you at present  you shall see me at the head
of women  by and bye  

 come  then   cried defarge  in a resounding voice   patriots and
friends  we are ready  the bastille  

with a roar that sounded as if all the breath in france had been shaped
into the detested word  the living sea rose  wave on wave  depth on
depth  and overflowed the city to that point  alarm bells ringing  drums
beating  the sea raging and thundering on its new beach  the attack
began 

deep ditches  double drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great
towers  cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  through the fire and through
the smoke  in the fire and in the smoke  for the sea cast him up against
a cannon  and on the instant he became a cannonier  defarge of the
wine shop worked like a manful soldier  two fierce hours 

deep ditch  single drawbridge  massive stone walls  eight great towers 
cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  one drawbridge down   work  comrades
all  work  work  jacques one  jacques two  jacques one thousand  jacques
two thousand  jacques five and twenty thousand  in the name of all
the angels or the devils  which you prefer  work   thus defarge of the
wine shop  still at his gun  which had long grown hot 

 to me  women   cried madame his wife   what  we can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken   and to her  with a shrill thirsty
cry  trooping women variously armed  but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge 

cannon  muskets  fire and smoke  but  still the deep ditch  the single
drawbridge  the massive stone walls  and the eight great towers  slight
displacements of the raging sea  made by the falling wounded  flashing
weapons  blazing torches  smoking waggonloads of wet straw  hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions  shrieks  volleys 
execrations  bravery without stint  boom smash and rattle  and the
furious sounding of the living sea  but  still the deep ditch  and the
single drawbridge  and the massive stone walls  and the eight great
towers  and still defarge of the wine shop at his gun  grown doubly hot
by the service of four fierce hours 

a white flag from within the fortress  and a parley  this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm  nothing audible in it  suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher  and swept defarge of the
wine shop over the lowered drawbridge  past the massive stone outer
walls  in among the eight great towers surrendered 

so resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on  that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the south sea  until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the bastille  there  against an angle of a wall  he
made a struggle to look about him  jacques three was nearly at his side 
madame defarge  still heading some of her women  was visible in the
inner distance  and her knife was in her hand  everywhere was tumult 
exultation  deafening and maniacal bewilderment  astounding noise  yet
furious dumb show 

 the prisoners  

 the records  

 the secret cells  

 the instruments of torture  

 the prisoners  

of all these cries  and ten thousand incoherences   the prisoners   was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in  as if there were an
eternity of people  as well as of time and space  when the foremost
billows rolled past  bearing the prison officers with them  and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed  defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men  a man with a grey head  who had a lighted torch in his
hand  separated him from the rest  and got him between himself and the
wall 

 show me the north tower   said defarge   quick  

 i will faithfully   replied the man   if you will come with me  but
there is no one there  

 what is the meaning of one hundred and five  north tower   asked
defarge   quick  

 the meaning  monsieur  

 does it mean a captive  or a place of captivity  or do you mean that i
shall strike you dead  

 kill him   croaked jacques three  who had come close up 

 monsieur  it is a cell  

 show it me  

 pass this way  then  

jacques three  with his usual craving on him  and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed 
held by defarge   arm as he held by the turnkey    their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse  and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another  even then  so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean  in its irruption into the fortress  and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases  all around
outside  too  it beat the walls with a deep  hoarse roar  from which 
occasionally  some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray 

through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone  past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages  down cavernous flights of steps 
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick  more like dry
waterfalls than staircases  defarge  the turnkey  and jacques three 
linked hand and arm  went with all the speed they could make  here and
there  especially at first  the inundation started on them and swept by 
but when they had done descending  and were winding and climbing up a
tower  they were alone  hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches  the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull  subdued way  as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing 

the turnkey stopped at a low door  put a key in a clashing lock  swung
the door slowly open  and said  as they all bent their heads and passed
in 

 one hundred and five  north tower  

there was a small  heavily grated  unglazed window high in the wall 
with a stone screen before it  so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up  there was a small chimney  heavily barred
across  a few feet within  there was a heap of old feathery wood ashes
on the hearth  there was a stool  and table  and a straw bed  there were
the four blackened walls  and a rusted iron ring in one of them 

 pass that torch slowly along these walls  that i may see them   said
defarge to the turnkey 

the man obeyed  and defarge followed the light closely with his eyes 

 stop   look here  jacques  

 a       croaked jacques three  as he read greedily 

 alexandre manette   said defarge in his ear  following the letters
with his swart forefinger  deeply engrained with gunpowder   and here he
wrote  a poor physician   and it was he  without doubt  who scratched
a calendar on this stone  what is that in your hand  a crowbar  give it
me  

he had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand  he made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments  and turning on the worm eaten stool and
table  beat them to pieces in a few blows 

 hold the light higher   he said  wrathfully  to the turnkey   look
among those fragments with care  jacques  and see  here is my knife  
throwing it to him   rip open that bed  and search the straw  hold the
light higher  you  

with a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth  and 
peering up the chimney  struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar 
and worked at the iron grating across it  in a few minutes  some mortar
and dust came dropping down  which he averted his face to avoid  and
in it  and in the old wood ashes  and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself  he groped with a
cautious touch 

 nothing in the wood  and nothing in the straw  jacques  

 nothing  

 let us collect them together  in the middle of the cell  so  light
them  you  

the turnkey fired the little pile  which blazed high and hot  stooping
again to come out at the low arched door  they left it burning  and
retraced their way to the courtyard  seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down  until they were in the raging flood once
more 

they found it surging and tossing  in quest of defarge himself  saint
antoine was clamorous to have its wine shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the bastille and shot the people 
otherwise  the governor would not be marched to the hotel de ville for
judgment  otherwise  the governor would escape  and the people  
blood  suddenly of some value  after many years of worthlessness  be
unavenged 

in the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration  there was but one quite steady figure  and that was a
woman     see  there is my husband   she cried  pointing him out 
 see defarge   she stood immovable close to the grim old officer  and
remained immovable close to him  remained immovable close to him through
the streets  as defarge and the rest bore him along  remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination  and began to
be struck at from behind  remained immovable close to him when the
long gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy  was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it  that  suddenly animated  she put her foot
upon his neck  and with her cruel knife  long ready  hewed off his head 

the hour was come  when saint antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do  saint
antoine   blood was up  and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down  down on the steps of the hotel de ville where the
governor   body lay  down on the sole of the shoe of madame defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation   lower
the lamp yonder   cried saint antoine  after glaring round for a new
means of death   here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard   the
swinging sentinel was posted  and the sea rushed on 

the sea of black and threatening waters  and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave  whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown  the remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes 
voices of vengeance  and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them 

but  in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life  there were two groups of faces  each seven in number  so
fixedly contrasting with the rest  that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it  seven faces of prisoners  suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb  were carried high
overhead  all scared  all lost  all wondering and amazed  as if the last
day were come  and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits 
other seven faces there were  carried higher  seven dead faces  whose
drooping eyelids and half seen eyes awaited the last day  impassive
faces  yet with a suspended  not an abolished  expression on them 
faces  rather  in a fearful pause  as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes  and bear witness with the bloodless lips   thou didst
it  

seven prisoners released  seven gory heads on pikes  the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers  some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time  long dead of broken
hearts   such  and such  like  the loudly echoing footsteps of saint
antoine escort through the paris streets in mid july  one thousand seven
hundred and eighty nine  now  heaven defeat the fancy of lucie darnay 
and keep these feet far out of her life  for  they are headlong  mad 
and dangerous  and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at defarge   wine shop door  they are not easily purified when once
stained red 




xxii  the sea still rises


haggard saint antoine had had only one exultant week  in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could  with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations  when madame
defarge sat at her counter  as usual  presiding over the customers 
madame defarge wore no rose in her head  for the great brotherhood of
spies had become  even in one short week  extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint   mercies  the lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them 

madame defarge  with her arms folded  sat in the morning light and heat 
contemplating the wine shop and the street  in both  there were several
knots of loungers  squalid and miserable  but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress  the raggedest nightcap  awry on
the wretchedest head  had this crooked significance in it   i know how
hard it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to support life in myself 
but do you know how easy it has grown for me  the wearer of this  to
destroy life in you   every lean bare arm  that had been without work
before  had this work always ready for it now  that it could strike 
the fingers of the knitting women were vicious  with the experience that
they could tear  there was a change in the appearance of saint antoine 
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years  and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression 

madame defarge sat observing it  with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the saint antoine women  one of her
sisterhood knitted beside her  the short  rather plump wife of a starved
grocer  and the mother of two children withal  this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of the vengeance 

 hark   said the vengeance   listen  then  who comes  

as if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of saint antoine
quarter to the wine shop door  had been suddenly fired  a fast spreading
murmur came rushing along 

 it is defarge   said madame   silence  patriots  

defarge came in breathless  pulled off a red cap he wore  and looked
around him   listen  everywhere   said madame again   listen to him  
defarge stood  panting  against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths  formed outside the door  all those within the wine shop had
sprung to their feet 

 say then  my husband  what is it  

 news from the other world  

 how  then   cried madame  contemptuously   the other world  

 does everybody here recall old foulon  who told the famished people
that they might eat grass  and who died  and went to hell  

 everybody   from all throats 

 the news is of him  he is among us  

 among us   from the universal throat again   and dead  

 not dead  he feared us so much  and with reason  that he caused himself
to be represented as dead  and had a grand mock funeral  but they have
found him alive  hiding in the country  and have brought him in  i have
seen him but now  on his way to the hotel de ville  a prisoner  i have
said that he had reason to fear us  say all   had  he reason  

wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten  if he had
never known it yet  he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry 

a moment of profound silence followed  defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another  the vengeance stooped  and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter 

 patriots   said defarge  in a determined voice   are we ready  

instantly madame defarge   knife was in her girdle  the drum was beating
in the streets  as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic  and
the vengeance  uttering terrific shrieks  and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty furies at once  was tearing from house to
house  rousing the women 

the men were terrible  in the bloody minded anger with which they looked
from windows  caught up what arms they had  and came pouring down into
the streets  but  the women were a sight to chill the boldest  from
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded  from their
children  from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked  they ran out with streaming hair  urging one
another  and themselves  to madness with the wildest cries and actions 
villain foulon taken  my sister  old foulon taken  my mother  miscreant
foulon taken  my daughter  then  a score of others ran into the midst of
these  beating their breasts  tearing their hair  and screaming  foulon
alive  foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass  foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass  when i had no bread
to give him  foulon who told my baby it might suck grass  when these
breasts were dry with want  o mother of god  this foulon  o heaven our
suffering  hear me  my dead baby and my withered father  i swear on my
knees  on these stones  to avenge you on foulon  husbands  and brothers 
and young men  give us the blood of foulon  give us the head of foulon 
give us the heart of foulon  give us the body and soul of foulon  rend
foulon to pieces  and dig him into the ground  that grass may grow from
him  with these cries  numbers of the women  lashed into blind frenzy 
whirled about  striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon  and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot 

nevertheless  not a moment was lost  not a moment  this foulon was at
the hotel de ville  and might be loosed  never  if saint antoine knew
his own sufferings  insults  and wrongs  armed men and women flocked out
of the quarter so fast  and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction  that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in saint antoine   bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children 

no  they were all by that time choking the hall of examination where
this old man  ugly and wicked  was  and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets  the defarges  husband and wife  the vengeance 
and jacques three  were in the first press  and at no great distance
from him in the hall 

 see   cried madame  pointing with her knife   see the old villain bound
with ropes  that was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back 
ha  ha  that was well done  let him eat it now   madame put her knife
under her arm  and clapped her hands as at a play 

the people immediately behind madame defarge  explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them  and those again explaining to
others  and those to others  the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands  similarly  during two or three hours of drawl 
and the winnowing of many bushels of words  madame defarge   frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up  with marvellous quickness  at
a distance  the more readily  because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows  knew madame defarge well  and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building 

at length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection  directly down upon the old prisoner   head  the favour was
too much to bear  in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long  went to the winds  and saint antoine had got
him 

it was known directly  to the furthest confines of the crowd  defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table  and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace  madame defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied  the vengeance and
jacques three were not yet up with them  and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the hall  like birds of prey from their high
perches  when the cry seemed to go up  all over the city   bring him
out  bring him to the lamp  

down  and up  and head foremost on the steps of the building  now  on
his knees  now  on his feet  now  on his back  dragged  and struck at 
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands  torn  bruised  panting  bleeding  yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy  now full of vehement agony of
action  with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see  now  a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs  he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung  and there madame defarge let him go  as a cat
might have done to a mouse  and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready  and while he besought her  the women passionately
screeching at him all the time  and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth  once  he went aloft  and the rope
broke  and they caught him shrieking  twice  he went aloft  and the rope
broke  and they caught him shrieking  then  the rope was merciful  and
held him  and his head was soon upon a pike  with grass enough in the
mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of 

nor was this the end of the day   bad work  for saint antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up  that it boiled again  on hearing when
the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched  another of the
people   enemies and insulters  was coming into paris under a guard
five hundred strong  in cavalry alone  saint antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper  seized him  would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear foulon company  set his head and heart on
pikes  and carried the three spoils of the day  in wolf procession
through the streets 

not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children 
wailing and breadless  then  the miserable bakers  shops were beset by
long files of them  patiently waiting to buy bad bread  and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty  they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day  and achieving them
again in gossip  gradually  these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away  and then poor lights began to shine in high windows  and
slender fires were made in the streets  at which neighbours cooked in
common  afterwards supping at their doors 

scanty and insufficient suppers those  and innocent of meat  as of
most other sauce to wretched bread  yet  human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands  and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them  fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day  played gently with their meagre children 
and lovers  with such a world around them and before them  loved and
hoped 

it was almost morning  when defarge   wine shop parted with its last
knot of customers  and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife  in
husky tones  while fastening the door 

 at last it is come  my dear  

 eh well   returned madame   almost  

saint antoine slept  the defarges slept  even the vengeance slept with
her starved grocer  and the drum was at rest  the drum   was the
only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed  the
vengeance  as custodian of the drum  could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell  or old foulon
was seized  not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint
antoine   bosom 




xxiii  fire rises


there was a change on the village where the fountain fell  and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together  the prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore  there were soldiers to guard it 
but not many  there were officers to guard the soldiers  but not one of
them knew what his men would do  beyond this  that it would probably not
be what he was ordered 

far and wide lay a ruined country  yielding nothing but desolation 
every green leaf  every blade of grass and blade of grain  was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people  everything was bowed down 
dejected  oppressed  and broken  habitations  fences  domesticated
animals  men  women  children  and the soil that bore them  all worn
out 

monseigneur  often a most worthy individual gentleman  was a national
blessing  gave a chivalrous tone to things  was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life  and a great deal more to equal purpose 
nevertheless  monseigneur as a class had  somehow or other  brought
things to this  strange that creation  designed expressly for
monseigneur  should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out  there must
be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements  surely  thus it
was  however  and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints  and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled  and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite  monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable 

but  this was not the change on the village  and on many a village like
it  for scores of years gone by  monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it  and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase  now  found in hunting the people  now  found in hunting
the beasts  for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness  no  the change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste  rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste  chiselled  and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of monseigneur 

for  in these times  as the mender of roads worked  solitary  in the
dust  not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return  being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it  in these times  as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour 
and viewed the prospect  he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot  the like of which was once a rarity in those parts  but was now
a frequent presence  as it advanced  the mender of roads would discern
without surprise  that it was a shaggy haired man  of almost barbarian
aspect  tall  in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads  grim  rough  swart  steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways  dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds  sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods 

such a man came upon him  like a ghost  at noon in the july weather 
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank  taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail 

the man looked at him  looked at the village in the hollow  at the mill 
and at the prison on the crag  when he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had  he said  in a dialect that was just
intelligible 

 how goes it  jacques  

 all well  jacques  

 touch then  

they joined hands  and the man sat down on the heap of stones 

 no dinner  

 nothing but supper now   said the mender of roads  with a hungry face 

 it is the fashion   growled the man   i meet no dinner anywhere  

he took out a blackened pipe  filled it  lighted it with flint and
steel  pulled at it until it was in a bright glow  then  suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb  that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke 

 touch then   it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time  after observing these operations  they again joined hands 

 to night   said the mender of roads 

 to night   said the man  putting the pipe in his mouth 

 where  

 here  

he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another  with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets  until the sky began to clear over the village 

 show me   said the traveller then  moving to the brow of the hill 

 see   returned the mender of roads  with extended finger   you go down
here  and straight through the street  and past the fountain   

 to the devil with all that   interrupted the other  rolling his eye
over the landscape    i  go through no streets and past no fountains 
well  

 well  about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village  

 good  when do you cease to work  

 at sunset  

 will you wake me  before departing  i have walked two nights without
resting  let me finish my pipe  and i shall sleep like a child  will you
wake me  

 surely  

the wayfarer smoked his pipe out  put it in his breast  slipped off his
great wooden shoes  and lay down on his back on the heap of stones  he
was fast asleep directly 

as the road mender plied his dusty labour  and the hail clouds  rolling
away  revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape  the little man  who wore a red cap
now  in place of his blue one  seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones  his eyes were so often turned towards it  that he used
his tools mechanically  and  one would have said  to very poor account 
the bronze face  the shaggy black hair and beard  the coarse woollen
red cap  the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts  the powerful frame attenuated by spare living  and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep  inspired the mender
of roads with awe  the traveller had travelled far  and his feet were
footsore  and his ankles chafed and bleeding  his great shoes  stuffed
with leaves and grass  had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues  and his clothes were chafed into holes  as he himself was into
sores  stooping down beside him  the road mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not  but  in vain  for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him  and set as resolutely as his lips 
fortified towns with their stockades  guard houses  gates  trenches  and
drawbridges  seemed to the mender of roads  to be so much air as against
this figure  and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around  he saw in his small fancy similar figures  stopped by no
obstacle  tending to centres all over france 

the man slept on  indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness  to sunshine on his face and shadow  to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them  until the sun was low in the west  and the sky was glowing  then 
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village  roused him 

 good   said the sleeper  rising on his elbow   two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill  

 about  

 about  good  

the mender of roads went home  with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind  and was soon at the fountain 
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink  and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village 
when the village had taken its poor supper  it did not creep to bed 
as it usually did  but came out of doors again  and remained there  a
curious contagion of whispering was upon it  and also  when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark  another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only  monsieur gabelle 
chief functionary of the place  became uneasy  went out on his house top
alone  and looked in that direction too  glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below  and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church  that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by and bye 

the night deepened  the trees environing the old chateau  keeping its
solitary state apart  moved in a rising wind  as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom  up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly  and beat at the great door  like a
swift messenger rousing those within  uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall  among the old spears and knives  and passed lamenting up the
stairs  and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis
had slept  east  west  north  and south  through the woods  four
heavy treading  unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches  striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard  four
lights broke out there  and moved away in different directions  and all
was black again 

but  not for long  presently  the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own  as though it were growing luminous 
then  a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front 
picking out transparent places  and showing where balustrades  arches 
and windows were  then it soared higher  and grew broader and brighter 
soon  from a score of the great windows  flames burst forth  and the
stone faces awakened  stared out of fire 

a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there  and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away  there was
spurring and splashing through the darkness  and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain  and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur
gabelle   door   help  gabelle  help  every one   the tocsin rang
impatiently  but other help  if that were any  there was none  the
mender of roads  and two hundred and fifty particular friends  stood
with folded arms at the fountain  looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky   it must be forty feet high   said they  grimly  and never moved 

the rider from the chateau  and the horse in a foam  clattered away
through the village  and galloped up the stony steep  to the prison on
the crag  at the gate  a group of officers were looking at the fire 
removed from them  a group of soldiers   help  gentlemen  officers  the
chateau is on fire  valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid  help  help   the officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire  gave no orders  and answered  with shrugs and biting
of lips   it must burn  

as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street  the
village was illuminating  the mender of roads  and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends  inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up  had darted into their houses  and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass  the general scarcity of everything 
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
monsieur gabelle  and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary   part  the mender of roads  once so submissive to
authority  had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with 
and that post horses would roast 

the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn  in the roaring and
raging of the conflagration  a red hot wind  driving straight from the
infernal regions  seemed to be blowing the edifice away  with the rising
and falling of the blaze  the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment  when great masses of stone and timber fell  the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured  anon struggled out of the smoke
again  as if it were the face of the cruel marquis  burning at the stake
and contending with the fire 

the chateau burned  the nearest trees  laid hold of by the fire 
scorched and shrivelled  trees at a distance  fired by the four fierce
figures  begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke  molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain  the water ran
dry  the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat  and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame  great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls  like crystallisation  stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace  four fierce figures
trudged away  east  west  north  and south  along the night enshrouded
roads  guided by the beacon they had lighted  towards their next
destination  the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin  and 
abolishing the lawful ringer  rang for joy 

not only that  but the village  light headed with famine  fire  and
bell ringing  and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes  though it was but a small instalment
of taxes  and no rent at all  that gabelle had got in those latter
days  became impatient for an interview with him  and  surrounding his
house  summoned him to come forth for personal conference  whereupon 
monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door  and retire to hold counsel
with himself  the result of that conference was  that gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys  this time
resolved  if his door were broken in  he was a small southern man
of retaliative temperament   to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet  and crush a man or two below 

probably  monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there  with the
distant chateau for fire and candle  and the beating at his door 
combined with the joy ringing  for music  not to mention his having an
ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate 
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour 
a trying suspense  to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean  ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur
gabelle had resolved  but  the friendly dawn appearing at last  and the
rush candles of the village guttering out  the people happily dispersed 
and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while 

within a hundred miles  and in the light of other fires  there were
other functionaries less fortunate  that night and other nights  whom
the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets  where they
had been born and bred  also  there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows  upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success  and whom they strung up
in their turn  but  the fierce figures were steadily wending east  west 
north  and south  be that as it would  and whosoever hung  fire burned 
the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it 
no functionary  by any stretch of mathematics  was able to calculate
successfully 




xxiv  drawn to the loadstone rock


in such risings of fire and risings of sea  the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb  but was always on the
flow  higher and higher  to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore  three years of tempest were consumed  three more birthdays
of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her home 

many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner  with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet  for  the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people  tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger  changed into wild beasts  by terrible enchantment long persisted
in 

monseigneur  as a class  had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated  of his being so little wanted in france  as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it  and
this life together  like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with
infinite pains  and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the enemy no question  but immediately fled  so  monseigneur  after
boldly reading the lord   prayer backwards for a great number of years 
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one  no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels 

the shining bull   eye of the court was gone  or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets  it had never been a good
eye to see with  had long had the mote in it of lucifer   pride 
sardanapalus   luxury  and a mole   blindness  but it had dropped
out and was gone  the court  from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue  corruption  and dissimulation  was
all gone together  royalty was gone  had been besieged in its palace and
 suspended   when the last tidings came over 

the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was
come  and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide 

as was natural  the head quarters and great gathering place of
monseigneur  in london  was tellson   bank  spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted  and monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be 
moreover  it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most
to be relied upon  came quickest  again  tellson   was a munificent
house  and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate  again  those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time  and anticipating plunder or confiscation  had made
provident remittances to tellson    were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren  to which it must be added that every new comer
from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson    almost as
a matter of course  for such variety of reasons  tellson   was at that
time  as to french intelligence  a kind of high exchange  and this
was so well known to the public  and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous  that tellson   sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows  for all who ran
through temple bar to read 

on a steaming  misty afternoon  mr  lorry sat at his desk  and charles
darnay stood leaning on it  talking with him in a low voice  the
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house  was now
the news exchange  and was filled to overflowing  it was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing 

 but  although you are the youngest man that ever lived   said charles
darnay  rather hesitating   i must still suggest to you   

 i understand  that i am too old   said mr  lorry 

 unsettled weather  a long journey  uncertain means of travelling  a
disorganised country  a city that may not be even safe for you  

 my dear charles   said mr  lorry  with cheerful confidence   you touch
some of the reasons for my going  not for my staying away  it is safe
enough for me  nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with  as to its being a disorganised city  if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
house here to our house there  who knows the city and the business  of
old  and is in tellson   confidence  as to the uncertain travelling  the
long journey  and the winter weather  if i were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellson    after all
these years  who ought to be  

 i wish i were going myself   said charles darnay  somewhat restlessly 
and like one thinking aloud 

 indeed  you are a pretty fellow to object and advise   exclaimed mr 
lorry   you wish you were going yourself  and you a frenchman born  you
are a wise counsellor  

 my dear mr  lorry  it is because i am a frenchman born  that the
thought  which i did not mean to utter here  however  has passed through
my mind often  one cannot help thinking  having had some sympathy for
the miserable people  and having abandoned something to them   he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner   that one might be listened to 
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint  only last night 
after you had left us  when i was talking to lucie   

 when you were talking to lucie   mr  lorry repeated   yes  i wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie  wishing you were going to
france at this time of day  

 however  i am not going   said charles darnay  with a smile   it is
more to the purpose that you say you are  

 and i am  in plain reality  the truth is  my dear charles   mr  lorry
glanced at the distant house  and lowered his voice   you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted  and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved  the
lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people  if some of our documents were seized or destroyed  and they
might be  at any time  you know  for who can say that paris is not set
afire to day  or sacked to morrow  now  a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay  and the burying of them  or otherwise
getting of them out of harm   way  is within the power  without loss of
precious time  of scarcely any one but myself  if any one  and shall
i hang back  when tellson   knows this and says this  tellson    whose
bread i have eaten these sixty years  because i am a little stiff about
the joints  why  i am a boy  sir  to half a dozen old codgers here  

 how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit  mr  lorry  

 tut  nonsense  sir   and  my dear charles   said mr  lorry  glancing at
the house again   you are to remember  that getting things out of
paris at this present time  no matter what things  is next to an
impossibility  papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here  i speak in strict confidence  it is not business like to
whisper it  even to you   by the strangest bearers you can imagine 
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the barriers  at another time  our parcels would come and go  as easily
as in business like old england  but now  everything is stopped  

 and do you really go to night  

 i really go to night  for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay  

 and do you take no one with you  

 all sorts of people have been proposed to me  but i will have nothing
to say to any of them  i intend to take jerry  jerry has been my
bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him 
nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bull dog  or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master  

 i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness  

 i must say again  nonsense  nonsense  when i have executed this little
commission  i shall  perhaps  accept tellson   proposal to retire and
live at my ease  time enough  then  to think about growing old  

this dialogue had taken place at mr  lorry   usual desk  with
monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it  boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long  it was too
much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee  and it
was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy  to talk of this
terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown  as if nothing had ever been done  or
omitted to be done  that had led to it  as if observers of the wretched
millions in france  and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous  had not seen it inevitably coming 
years before  and had not in plain words recorded what they saw  such
vapouring  combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself 
and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself  was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth  and it was
such vapouring all about his ears  like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head  added to a latent uneasiness in his mind  which had
already made charles darnay restless  and which still kept him so 

among the talkers  was stryver  of the king   bench bar  far on his
way to state promotion  and  therefore  loud on the theme  broaching
to monseigneur  his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth  and doing without them  and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race  him  darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection  and darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more  and remaining to interpose his
word  when the thing that was to be  went on to shape itself out 

the house approached mr  lorry  and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him  asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed  the house laid the letter down so close to darnay
that he saw the direction  the more quickly because it was his own right
name  the address  turned into english  ran 

 very pressing  to monsieur heretofore the marquis st  evremonde  of
france  confided to the cares of messrs  tellson and co   bankers 
london  england  

on the marriage morning  doctor manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to charles darnay  that the secret of this name should
be  unless he  the doctor  dissolved the obligation  kept inviolate
between them  nobody else knew it to be his name  his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact  mr  lorry could have none 

 no   said mr  lorry  in reply to the house   i have referred it 
i think  to everybody now here  and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found  

the hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the bank  there
was a general set of the current of talkers past mr  lorry   desk  he
held the letter out inquiringly  and monseigneur looked at it  in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee  and monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee  and this  that 
and the other  all had something disparaging to say  in french or in
english  concerning the marquis who was not to be found 

 nephew  i believe  but in any case degenerate successor  of the
polished marquis who was murdered   said one   happy to say  i never
knew him  

 a craven who abandoned his post   said another  this monseigneur had
been got out of paris  legs uppermost and half suffocated  in a load of
hay   some years ago  

 infected with the new doctrines   said a third  eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing   set himself in opposition to the last
marquis  abandoned the estates when he inherited them  and left them to
the ruffian herd  they will recompense him now  i hope  as he deserves  

 hey   cried the blatant stryver   did he though  is that the sort of
fellow  let us look at his infamous name       the fellow  

darnay  unable to restrain himself any longer  touched mr  stryver on
the shoulder  and said 

 i know the fellow  

 do you  by jupiter   said stryver   i am sorry for it  

 why  

 why  mr  darnay    ye hear what he did  don   ask  why  in these
times  

 but i do ask why  

 then i tell you again  mr  darnay  i am sorry for it  i am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions  here is a fellow 
who  infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known  abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale  and you ask me why i am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him  well  but i ll answer you  i am sorry
because i believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel  that  
why  

mindful of the secret  darnay with great difficulty checked himself  and
said   you may not understand the gentleman  

 i understand how to put  you  in a corner  mr  darnay   said bully
stryver   and i ll do it  if this fellow is a gentleman  i  don   
understand him  you may tell him so  with my compliments  you may also
tell him  from me  that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob  i wonder he is not at the head of them  but  no 
gentlemen   said stryver  looking all round  and snapping his fingers 
 i know something of human nature  and i tell you that you ll never
find a fellow like this fellow  trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious  protégés   no  gentlemen  he ll always show  em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle  and sneak away  

with those words  and a final snap of his fingers  mr  stryver
shouldered himself into fleet street  amidst the general approbation of
his hearers  mr  lorry and charles darnay were left alone at the desk 
in the general departure from the bank 

 will you take charge of the letter   said mr  lorry   you know where to
deliver it  

 i do  

 will you undertake to explain  that we suppose it to have been
addressed here  on the chance of our knowing where to forward it  and
that it has been here some time  

 i will do so  do you start for paris from here  

 from here  at eight  

 i will come back  to see you off  

very ill at ease with himself  and with stryver and most other men 
darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the temple  opened the
letter  and read it  these were its contents 


 prison of the abbaye  paris 

 june 21  1792   monsieur heretofore the marquis 

 after having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village  i have been seized  with great violence and indignity  and
brought a long journey on foot to paris  on the road i have suffered a
great deal  nor is that all  my house has been destroyed  razed to the
ground 

 the crime for which i am imprisoned  monsieur heretofore the marquis 
and for which i shall be summoned before the tribunal  and shall lose my
life  without your so generous help   is  they tell me  treason against
the majesty of the people  in that i have acted against them for an
emigrant  it is in vain i represent that i have acted for them  and not
against  according to your commands  it is in vain i represent that 
before the sequestration of emigrant property  i had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay  that i had collected no rent  that i had
had recourse to no process  the only response is  that i have acted for
an emigrant  and where is that emigrant 

 ah  most gracious monsieur heretofore the marquis  where is that
emigrant  i cry in my sleep where is he  i demand of heaven  will he
not come to deliver me  no answer  ah monsieur heretofore the marquis 
i send my desolate cry across the sea  hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of tilson known at paris 

 for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of
your noble name  i supplicate you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  to
succour and release me  my fault is  that i have been true to you  oh
monsieur heretofore the marquis  i pray you be you true to me 

 from this prison here of horror  whence i every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction  i send you  monsieur heretofore the marquis  the
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service 

 your afflicted 

 gabelle  


the latent uneasiness in darnay   mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter  the peril of an old servant and a good one  whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family  stared him so
reproachfully in the face  that  as he walked to and fro in the temple
considering what to do  he almost hid his face from the passersby 

he knew very well  that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house  in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle  and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold 
he had acted imperfectly  he knew very well  that in his love for lucie 
his renunciation of his social place  though by no means new to his own
mind  had been hurried and incomplete  he knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it  and that he had meant to
do it  and that it had never been done 

the happiness of his own chosen english home  the necessity of being
always actively employed  the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast  that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week  and the events of the week
following made all new again  he knew very well  that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded   not without disquiet  but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance  that he had watched
the times for a time of action  and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by  and the nobility were trooping from
france by every highway and byway  and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction  and their very names were blotting out 
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
france that might impeach him for it 

but  he had oppressed no man  he had imprisoned no man  he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues  that he had
relinquished them of his own will  thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it  won his own private place there  and earned his own
bread  monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions  to spare the people  to give them what little
there was to give  such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter  and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer  and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof  for his
own safety  so that it could not but appear now 

this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make 
that he would go to paris 

yes  like the mariner in the old story  the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the loadstone rock  and it was drawing him
to itself  and he must go  everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on  faster and faster  more and more steadily  to the terrible
attraction  his latent uneasiness had been  that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments  and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they  was not there 
trying to do something to stay bloodshed  and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity  with this uneasiness half stifled  and half reproaching
him  he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong  upon that comparison
 injurious to himself  had instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur 
which had stung him bitterly  and those of stryver  which above all were
coarse and galling  for old reasons  upon those  had followed gabelle  
letter  the appeal of an innocent prisoner  in danger of death  to his
justice  honour  and good name 

his resolution was made  he must go to paris 

yes  the loadstone rock was drawing him  and he must sail on  until he
struck  he knew of no rock  he saw hardly any danger  the intention
with which he had done what he had done  even although he had left
it incomplete  presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in france on his presenting himself to assert
it  then  that glorious vision of doing good  which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds  arose before him  and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
revolution that was running so fearfully wild 

as he walked to and fro with his resolution made  he considered that
neither lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone 
lucie should be spared the pain of separation  and her father  always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old 
should come to the knowledge of the step  as a step taken  and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt  how much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father  through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of france in his mind  he did not
discuss with himself  but  that circumstance too  had had its influence
in his course 

he walked to and fro  with thoughts very busy  until it was time to
return to tellson   and take leave of mr  lorry  as soon as he arrived
in paris he would present himself to this old friend  but he must say
nothing of his intention now 

a carriage with post horses was ready at the bank door  and jerry was
booted and equipped 

 i have delivered that letter   said charles darnay to mr  lorry   i
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer  but
perhaps you will take a verbal one  

 that i will  and readily   said mr  lorry   if it is not dangerous  

 not at all  though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye  

 what is his name   said mr  lorry  with his open pocket book in his
hand 

 gabelle  

 gabelle  and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison  

 simply   that he has received the letter  and will come   

 any time mentioned  

 he will start upon his journey to morrow night  

 any person mentioned  

 no  

he helped mr  lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks 
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank  into the
misty air of fleet street   my love to lucie  and to little lucie   said
mr  lorry at parting   and take precious care of them till i come back  
charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled  as the carriage
rolled away 

that night  it was the fourteenth of august  he sat up late  and wrote
two fervent letters  one was to lucie  explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to paris  and showing her  at length  the reasons
that he had  for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there  the other was to the doctor  confiding lucie and
their dear child to his care  and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances  to both  he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety  immediately after his arrival 

it was a hard day  that day of being among them  with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind  it was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious 
but  an affectionate glance at his wife  so happy and busy  made him
resolute not to tell her what impended  he had been half moved to do it 
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid   and
the day passed quickly  early in the evening he embraced her  and her
scarcely less dear namesake  pretending that he would return by and bye
 an imaginary engagement took him out  and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready   and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets  with a heavier heart 

the unseen force was drawing him fast to itself  now  and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it  he left his
two letters with a trusty porter  to be delivered half an hour before
midnight  and no sooner  took horse for dover  and began his journey 
 for the love of heaven  of justice  of generosity  of the honour of
your noble name   was the poor prisoner   cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart  as he left all that was dear on earth behind him  and
floated away for the loadstone rock 


the end of the second book 





book the third  the track of a storm




i  in secret


the traveller fared slowly on his way  who fared towards paris from
england in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety two  more than enough of bad roads  bad equipages  and bad
horses  he would have encountered to delay him  though the fallen and
unfortunate king of france had been upon his throne in all his glory 
but  the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these  every town gate and village taxing house had its band of
citizen patriots  with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness  who stopped all comers and goers  cross questioned them 
inspected their papers  looked for their names in lists of their own 
turned them back  or sent them on  or stopped them and laid them in
hold  as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
republic one and indivisible  of liberty  equality  fraternity  or
death 

a very few french leagues of his journey were accomplished  when charles
darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at paris  whatever might befall now  he must on to his journey   end 
not a mean village closed upon him  not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him  but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and england  the universal
watchfulness so encompassed him  that if he had been taken in a net 
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage  he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone 

this universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage  but retarded his progress twenty times in a day  by
riding after him and taking him back  riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation  riding with him and keeping him in charge  he had been
days upon his journey in france alone  when he went to bed tired out  in
a little town on the high road  still a long way from paris 

nothing but the production of the afflicted gabelle   letter from his
prison of the abbaye would have got him on so far  his difficulty at the
guard house in this small place had been such  that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis  and he was  therefore  as little surprised as
a man could be  to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning  in the middle of the night 

awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths  who sat down on the bed 

 emigrant   said the functionary   i am going to send you on to paris 
under an escort  

 citizen  i desire nothing more than to get to paris  though i could
dispense with the escort  

 silence   growled a red cap  striking at the coverlet with the butt end
of his musket   peace  aristocrat  

 it is as the good patriot says   observed the timid functionary   you
are an aristocrat  and must have an escort  and must pay for it  

 i have no choice   said charles darnay 

 choice  listen to him   cried the same scowling red cap   as if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp iron  

 it is always as the good patriot says   observed the functionary   rise
and dress yourself  emigrant  

darnay complied  and was taken back to the guard house  where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking  drinking  and sleeping  by
a watch fire  here he paid a heavy price for his escort  and hence he
started with it on the wet  wet roads at three o clock in the morning 

the escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri coloured
cockades  armed with national muskets and sabres  who rode one on either
side of him 

the escorted governed his own horse  but a loose line was attached to
his bridle  the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist  in this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces  clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement 
and out upon the mire deep roads  in this state they traversed without
change  except of horses and pace  all the mire deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital 

they travelled in the night  halting an hour or two after daybreak  and
lying by until the twilight fell  the escort were so wretchedly clothed 
that they twisted straw round their bare legs  and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off  apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended  and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk  and carrying
his musket very recklessly  charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast  for 
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated  and of representations 
confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye  that were not yet made 

but when they came to the town of beauvais  which they did at eventide 
when the streets were filled with people  he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming  an ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting yard  and many voices called
out loudly   down with the emigrant  

he stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle  and 
resuming it as his safest place  said 

 emigrant  my friends  do you not see me here  in france  of my own
will  

 you are a cursed emigrant   cried a farrier  making at him in a
furious manner through the press  hammer in hand   and you are a cursed
aristocrat  

the postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider  
bridle  at which he was evidently making   and soothingly said   let him
be  let him be  he will be judged at paris  

 judged   repeated the farrier  swinging his hammer   ay  and condemned
as a traitor   at this the crowd roared approval 

checking the postmaster  who was for turning his horse   head to the
yard  the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on  with
the line round his wrist   darnay said  as soon as he could make his
voice heard 

 friends  you deceive yourselves  or you are deceived  i am not a
traitor  

 he lies   cried the smith   he is a traitor since the decree  his life
is forfeit to the people  his cursed life is not his own  

at the instant when darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd  which
another instant would have brought upon him  the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard  the escort rode in close upon his horse   flanks 
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates  the farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer  and the crowd groaned  but  no
more was done 

 what is this decree that the smith spoke of   darnay asked the
postmaster  when he had thanked him  and stood beside him in the yard 

 truly  a decree for selling the property of emigrants  

 when passed  

 on the fourteenth  

 the day i left england  

 everybody says it is but one of several  and that there will be
others  if there are not already  banishing all emigrants  and
condemning all to death who return  that is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own  

 but there are no such decrees yet  

 what do i know   said the postmaster  shrugging his shoulders   there
may be  or there will be  it is all the same  what would you have  

they rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night  and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep  among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal  not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep  after long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads  they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages  not steeped in darkness  but all glittering with lights  and
would find the people  in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night 
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of liberty  or all drawn
up together singing a liberty song  happily  however  there was sleep in
beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness  jingling through the untimely cold and
wet  among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year  diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses  and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade  and sharp reining up across their
way  of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads 

daylight at last found them before the wall of paris  the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it 

 where are the papers of this prisoner   demanded a resolute looking man
in authority  who was summoned out by the guard 

naturally struck by the disagreeable word  charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen 
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him  and which he had paid for 

 where   repeated the same personage  without taking any heed of him
whatever   are the papers of this prisoner  

the drunken patriot had them in his cap  and produced them  casting his
eyes over gabelle   letter  the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise  and looked at darnay with a close attention 

he left escort and escorted without saying a word  however  and went
into the guard room  meanwhile  they sat upon their horses outside the
gate  looking about him while in this state of suspense  charles
darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots  the latter far outnumbering the former  and that while ingress
into the city for peasants  carts bringing in supplies  and for similar
traffic and traffickers  was easy enough  egress  even for the homeliest
people  was very difficult  a numerous medley of men and women  not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts  was waiting to issue
forth  but  the previous identification was so strict  that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly  some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off  that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke  while others talked together  or loitered
about  the red cap and tri colour cockade were universal  both among men
and women 

when he had sat in his saddle some half hour  taking note of these
things  darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority 
who directed the guard to open the barrier  then he delivered to the
escort  drunk and sober  a receipt for the escorted  and requested him
to dismount  he did so  and the two patriots  leading his tired horse 
turned and rode away without entering the city 

he accompanied his conductor into a guard room  smelling of common wine
and tobacco  where certain soldiers and patriots  asleep and awake 
drunk and sober  and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking  drunkenness and sobriety  were standing and lying about  the
light in the guard house  half derived from the waning oil lamps of
the night  and half from the overcast day  was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition  some registers were lying open on a desk  and an
officer of a coarse  dark aspect  presided over these 

 citizen defarge   said he to darnay   conductor  as he took a slip of
paper to write on   is this the emigrant evremonde  

 this is the man  

 your age  evremonde  

 thirty seven  

 married  evremonde  

 yes  

 where married  

 in england  

 without doubt  where is your wife  evremonde  

 in england  

 without doubt  you are consigned  evremonde  to the prison of la
force  

 just heaven   exclaimed darnay   under what law  and for what offence  

the officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment 

 we have new laws  evremonde  and new offences  since you were here   he
said it with a hard smile  and went on writing 

 i entreat you to observe that i have come here voluntarily  in response
to that written appeal of a fellow countryman which lies before you  i
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay  is not that
my right  

 emigrants have no rights  evremonde   was the stolid reply  the officer
wrote until he had finished  read over to himself what he had written 
sanded it  and handed it to defarge  with the words  in secret  

defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him  the prisoner obeyed  and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them 

 is it you   said defarge  in a low voice  as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into paris   who married the daughter of
doctor manette  once a prisoner in the bastille that is no more  

 yes   replied darnay  looking at him with surprise 

 my name is defarge  and i keep a wine shop in the quarter saint
antoine  possibly you have heard of me  

 my wife came to your house to reclaim her father  yes  

the word  wife  seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to defarge  to say
with sudden impatience   in the name of that sharp female newly born 
and called la guillotine  why did you come to france  

 you heard me say why  a minute ago  do you not believe it is the
truth  

 a bad truth for you   said defarge  speaking with knitted brows  and
looking straight before him 

 indeed i am lost here  all here is so unprecedented  so changed  so
sudden and unfair  that i am absolutely lost  will you render me a
little help  

 none   defarge spoke  always looking straight before him 

 will you answer me a single question  

 perhaps  according to its nature  you can say what it is  

 in this prison that i am going to so unjustly  shall i have some free
communication with the world outside  

 you will see  

 i am not to be buried there  prejudged  and without any means of
presenting my case  

 you will see  but  what then  other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons  before now  

 but never by me  citizen defarge  

defarge glanced darkly at him for answer  and walked on in a steady
and set silence  the deeper he sank into this silence  the fainter hope
there was  or so darnay thought  of his softening in any slight degree 
he  therefore  made haste to say 

 it is of the utmost importance to me  you know  citizen  even better
than i  of how much importance   that i should be able to communicate to
mr  lorry of tellson   bank  an english gentleman who is now in paris 
the simple fact  without comment  that i have been thrown into the
prison of la force  will you cause that to be done for me  

 i will do   defarge doggedly rejoined   nothing for you  my duty is to
my country and the people  i am the sworn servant of both  against you 
i will do nothing for you  

charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further  and his pride
was touched besides  as they walked on in silence  he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets  the very children scarcely noticed him  a few passers turned
their heads  and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat 
otherwise  that a man in good clothes should be going to prison  was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work  in one narrow  dark  and dirty street through which they
passed  an excited orator  mounted on a stool  was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people  of the king and the royal
family  the few words that he caught from this man   lips  first made
it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison  and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris  on the road  except at
beauvais  he had heard absolutely nothing  the escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him 

that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left england  he of course knew now  that
perils had thickened about him fast  and might thicken faster and faster
yet  he of course knew now  he could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey  if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days  and yet his misgivings were not so dark as  imagined by
the light of this later time  they would appear  troubled as the future
was  it was the unknown future  and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope  the horrible massacre  days and nights long  which  within a few
rounds of the clock  was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest  was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away  the  sharp female newly born  and
called la guillotine   was hardly known to him  or to the generality
of people  by name  the frightful deeds that were to be soon done  were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers  how could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind 

of unjust treatment in detention and hardship  and in cruel separation
from his wife and child  he foreshadowed the likelihood  or the
certainty  but  beyond this  he dreaded nothing distinctly  with this on
his mind  which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard  he
arrived at the prison of la force 

a man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket  to whom defarge
presented  the emigrant evremonde  

 what the devil  how many more of them   exclaimed the man with the
bloated face 

defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation  and withdrew 
with his two fellow patriots 

 what the devil  i say again   exclaimed the gaoler  left with his wife 
 how many more  

the gaoler   wife  being provided with no answer to the question  merely
replied   one must have patience  my dear   three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang  echoed the sentiment  and one added   for
the love of liberty   which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion 

the prison of la force was a gloomy prison  dark and filthy  and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it  extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep  becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for 

 in secret  too   grumbled the gaoler  looking at the written paper   as
if i was not already full to bursting  

he stuck the paper on a file  in an ill humour  and charles darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour  sometimes  pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room  sometimes  resting on a stone seat  in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates 

 come   said the chief  at length taking up his keys   come with me 
emigrant  

through the dismal prison twilight  his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase  many doors clanging and locking behind them 
until they came into a large  low  vaulted chamber  crowded with
prisoners of both sexes  the women were seated at a long table  reading
and writing  knitting  sewing  and embroidering  the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs  or lingering up and down the
room 

in the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace  the new comer recoiled from this company  but the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride  was  their all at once rising to
receive him  with every refinement of manner known to the time  and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life 

so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom  so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen  that charles darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead  ghosts all  the ghost of beauty  the ghost
of stateliness  the ghost of elegance  the ghost of pride  the ghost of
frivolity  the ghost of wit  the ghost of youth  the ghost of age  all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore  all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there 

it struck him motionless  the gaoler standing at his side  and the other
gaolers moving about  who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions  looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there  with the apparitions of the coquette  the young beauty  and the
mature woman delicately bred  that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented  was heightened to its
utmost  surely  ghosts all  surely  the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades 

 in the name of the assembled companions in misfortune   said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address  coming forward   i have the
honour of giving you welcome to la force  and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us  may it soon terminate
happily  it would be an impertinence elsewhere  but it is not so here 
to ask your name and condition  

charles darnay roused himself  and gave the required information  in
words as suitable as he could find 

 but i hope   said the gentleman  following the chief gaoler with his
eyes  who moved across the room   that you are not in secret  

 i do not understand the meaning of the term  but i have heard them say
so  

 ah  what a pity  we so much regret it  but take courage  several
members of our society have been in secret  at first  and it has lasted
but a short time   then he added  raising his voice   i grieve to inform
the society  in secret  

there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him  and many voices  among
which  the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous  gave
him good wishes and encouragement  he turned at the grated door  to
render the thanks of his heart  it closed under the gaoler   hand  and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever 

the wicket opened on a stone staircase  leading upward  when they had
ascended forty steps  the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them   the gaoler opened a low black door  and they passed into a
solitary cell  it struck cold and damp  but was not dark 

 yours   said the gaoler 

 why am i confined alone  

 how do i know  

 i can buy pen  ink  and paper  

 such are not my orders  you will be visited  and can ask then  at
present  you may buy your food  and nothing more  

there were in the cell  a chair  a table  and a straw mattress  as
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects  and of the four
walls  before going out  a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him  that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated  both in face and person  as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water  when the gaoler was
gone  he thought in the same wandering way   now am i left  as if i were
dead   stopping then  to look down at the mattress  he turned from it
with a sick feeling  and thought   and here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death  

 five paces by four and a half  five paces by four and a half  five
paces by four and a half   the prisoner walked to and fro in his cell 
counting its measurement  and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them   he made shoes  he made
shoes  he made shoes   the prisoner counted the measurement again  and
paced faster  to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition 
 the ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed  there was one among
them  the appearance of a lady dressed in black  who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window  and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair  and she looked like         let us ride on again  for god   sake 
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake          he
made shoes  he made shoes  he made shoes          five paces by four and
a half   with such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind  the prisoner walked faster and faster  obstinately counting
and counting  and the roar of the city changed to this extent  that it
still rolled in like muffled drums  but with the wail of voices that he
knew  in the swell that rose above them 




ii  the grindstone


tellson   bank  established in the saint germain quarter of paris  was
in a wing of a large house  approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate  the house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles  in his own cook   dress  and got across the borders  a
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters  he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than the same monseigneur  the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides the cook in question 

monseigneur gone  and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages  by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning republic one and
indivisible of liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  monseigneur  
house had been first sequestrated  and then confiscated  for  all
things moved so fast  and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation  that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of september  patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
monseigneur   house  and had marked it with the tri colour  and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments 

a place of business in london like tellson   place of business in paris 
would soon have driven the house out of its mind and into the gazette 
for  what would staid british responsibility and respectability have
said to orange trees in boxes in a bank courtyard  and even to a cupid
over the counter  yet such things were  tellson   had whitewashed the
cupid  but he was still to be seen on the ceiling  in the coolest
linen  aiming  as he very often does  at money from morning to
night  bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young pagan  in
lombard street  london  and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy  and also of a looking glass let into the wall  and
also of clerks not at all old  who danced in public on the slightest
provocation  yet  a french tellson   could get on with these things
exceedingly well  and  as long as the times held together  no man had
taken fright at them  and drawn out his money 

what money would be drawn out of tellson   henceforth  and what would
lie there  lost and forgotten  what plate and jewels would tarnish in
tellson   hiding places  while the depositors rusted in prisons 
and when they should have violently perished  how many accounts with
tellson   never to be balanced in this world  must be carried over into
the next  no man could have said  that night  any more than mr  jarvis
lorry could  though he thought heavily of these questions  he sat by
a newly lighted wood fire  the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold   and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw  or any object in the
room distortedly reflect  a shade of horror 

he occupied rooms in the bank  in his fidelity to the house of which
he had grown to be a part  like strong root ivy  it chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building  but the true hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that  all such circumstances were indifferent to him  so that he did
his duty  on the opposite side of the courtyard  under a colonnade 
was extensive standing  for carriages  where  indeed  some carriages
of monseigneur yet stood  against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux  and in the light of these  standing out in the
open air  was a large grindstone  a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy 
or other workshop  rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects  mr  lorry shivered  and retired to his seat by the fire  he had
opened  not only the glass window  but the lattice blind outside it  and
he had closed both again  and he shivered through his frame 

from the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate  there came
the usual night hum of the city  with now and then an indescribable ring
in it  weird and unearthly  as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to heaven 

 thank god   said mr  lorry  clasping his hands   that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to night  may he have mercy on all
who are in danger  

soon afterwards  the bell at the great gate sounded  and he thought 
 they have come back   and sat listening  but  there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard  as he had expected  and he heard the gate
clash again  and all was quiet 

the nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the bank  which a great change would naturally
awaken  with such feelings roused  it was well guarded  and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it  when his door suddenly
opened  and two figures rushed in  at sight of which he fell back in
amazement 

lucie and her father  lucie with her arms stretched out to him  and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified  that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life 

 what is this   cried mr  lorry  breathless and confused   what is the
matter  lucie  manette  what has happened  what has brought you here 
what is it  

with the look fixed upon him  in her paleness and wildness  she panted
out in his arms  imploringly   o my dear friend  my husband  

 your husband  lucie  

 charles  

 what of charles  

 here 

 here  in paris  

 has been here some days  three or four  i don   know how many  i can  
collect my thoughts  an errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us  he was stopped at the barrier  and sent to prison  

the old man uttered an irrepressible cry  almost at the same moment  the
beg of the great gate rang again  and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard 

 what is that noise   said the doctor  turning towards the window 

 don   look   cried mr  lorry   don   look out  manette  for your life 
don   touch the blind  

the doctor turned  with his hand upon the fastening of the window  and
said  with a cool  bold smile 

 my dear friend  i have a charmed life in this city  i have been
a bastille prisoner  there is no patriot in paris  in paris  in
france  who  knowing me to have been a prisoner in the bastille  would
touch me  except to overwhelm me with embraces  or carry me in triumph 
my old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier  and gained us news of charles there  and brought us here  i
knew it would be so  i knew i could help charles out of all danger  i
told lucie so   what is that noise   his hand was again upon the window 

 don   look   cried mr  lorry  absolutely desperate   no  lucie  my
dear  nor you   he got his arm round her  and held her   don   be so
terrified  my love  i solemnly swear to you that i know of no harm
having happened to charles  that i had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place  what prison is he in  

 la force  

 la force  lucie  my child  if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life  and you were always both  you will compose yourself now  to
do exactly as i bid you  for more depends upon it than you can think  or
i can say  there is no help for you in any action on your part to night 
you cannot possibly stir out  i say this  because what i must bid you
to do for charles   sake  is the hardest thing to do of all  you must
instantly be obedient  still  and quiet  you must let me put you in a
room at the back here  you must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes  and as there are life and death in the world you must not
delay  

 i will be submissive to you  i see in your face that you know i can do
nothing else than this  i know you are true  

the old man kissed her  and hurried her into his room  and turned the
key  then  came hurrying back to the doctor  and opened the window and
partly opened the blind  and put his hand upon the doctor   arm  and
looked out with him into the courtyard 

looked out upon a throng of men and women  not enough in number  or near
enough  to fill the courtyard  not more than forty or fifty in all  the
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate  and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone  it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose  as in a convenient and retired spot 

but  such awful workers  and such awful work 

the grindstone had a double handle  and  turning at it madly were two
men  whose faces  as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up  were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise 
false eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them  and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty  and all awry with
howling  and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep  as these ruffians turned and turned  their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes  now flung backward over their necks  some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink  and what with dropping
blood  and what with dropping wine  and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone  all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire  the eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood  shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening stone  were men stripped to the waist  with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies  men in all sorts of rags  with the stain
upon those rags  men devilishly set off with spoils of women   lace
and silk and ribbon  with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through  hatchets  knives  bayonets  swords  all brought to be
sharpened  were all red with it  some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them  with strips of linen and fragments
of dress  ligatures various in kind  but all deep of the one colour  and
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets  the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes   eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life  to petrify with a well directed gun 

all this was seen in a moment  as the vision of a drowning man  or of
any human creature at any very great pass  could see a world if it
were there  they drew back from the window  and the doctor looked for
explanation in his friend   ashy face 

 they are   mr  lorry whispered the words  glancing fearfully round at
the locked room   murdering the prisoners  if you are sure of what you
say  if you really have the power you think you have  as i believe you
have  make yourself known to these devils  and get taken to la force  it
may be too late  i don   know  but let it not be a minute later  

doctor manette pressed his hand  hastened bareheaded out of the room 
and was in the courtyard when mr  lorry regained the blind 

his streaming white hair  his remarkable face  and the impetuous
confidence of his manner  as he put the weapons aside like water 
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone 
for a few moments there was a pause  and a hurry  and a murmur  and
the unintelligible sound of his voice  and then mr  lorry saw him 
surrounded by all  and in the midst of a line of twenty men long  all
linked shoulder to shoulder  and hand to shoulder  hurried out with
cries of   live the bastille prisoner  help for the bastille prisoner  
kindred in la force  room for the bastille prisoner in front there  save
the prisoner evremonde at la force   and a thousand answering shouts 

he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart  closed the window
and the curtain  hastened to lucie  and told her that her father was
assisted by the people  and gone in search of her husband  he found
her child and miss pross with her  but  it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards  when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew 

lucie had  by that time  fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet 
clinging to his hand  miss pross had laid the child down on his own
bed  and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge  o the long  long night  with the moans of the poor wife  and o
the long  long night  with no return of her father and no tidings 

twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded  and the
irruption was repeated  and the grindstone whirled and spluttered 
 what is it   cried lucie  affrighted   hush  the soldiers  swords are
sharpened there   said mr  lorry   the place is national property now 
and used as a kind of armoury  my love  

twice more in all  but  the last spell of work was feeble and fitful 
soon afterwards the day began to dawn  and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand  and cautiously looked out again  a man  so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain  was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone  and looking about him with a vacant air 
shortly  this worn out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of monseigneur  and  staggering to that gorgeous vehicle 
climbed in at the door  and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions 

the great grindstone  earth  had turned when mr  lorry looked out again 
and the sun was red on the courtyard  but  the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air  with a red upon it that the sun had
never given  and would never take away 




iii  the shadow


one of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of mr 
lorry when business hours came round  was this   that he had no right to
imperil tellson   by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the bank roof  his own possessions  safety  life  he would have hazarded
for lucie and her child  without a moment   demur  but the great trust
he held was not his own  and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business 

at first  his mind reverted to defarge  and he thought of finding out
the wine shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling place in the distracted state of the city  but  the
same consideration that suggested him  repudiated him  he lived in the
most violent quarter  and doubtless was influential there  and deep in
its dangerous workings 

noon coming  and the doctor not returning  and every minute   delay
tending to compromise tellson    mr  lorry advised with lucie  she said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term  in that
quarter  near the banking house  as there was no business objection to
this  and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles  and
he were to be released  he could not hope to leave the city  mr  lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging  and found a suitable one  high up
in a removed by street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes 

to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child  and miss pross 
giving them what comfort he could  and much more than he had himself 
he left jerry with them  as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head  and retained to his own occupations 
a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them  and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him 

it wore itself out  and wore him out with it  until the bank closed  he
was again alone in his room of the previous night  considering what to
do next  when he heard a foot upon the stair  in a few moments  a
man stood in his presence  who  with a keenly observant look at him 
addressed him by his name 

 your servant   said mr  lorry   do you know me  

he was a strongly made man with dark curling hair  from forty five
to fifty years of age  for answer he repeated  without any change of
emphasis  the words 

 do you know me  

 i have seen you somewhere  

 perhaps at my wine shop  

much interested and agitated  mr  lorry said   you come from doctor
manette  

 yes  i come from doctor manette  

 and what says he  what does he send me  

defarge gave into his anxious hand  an open scrap of paper  it bore the
words in the doctor   writing 

     charles is safe  but i cannot safely leave this place yet 
     i have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
     from charles to his wife   let the bearer see his wife  

it was dated from la force  within an hour 

 will you accompany me   said mr  lorry  joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud   to where his wife resides  

 yes   returned defarge 

scarcely noticing as yet  in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way defarge spoke  mr  lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard  there  they found two women  one  knitting 

 madame defarge  surely   said mr  lorry  who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago 

 it is she   observed her husband 

 does madame go with us   inquired mr  lorry  seeing that she moved as
they moved 

 yes  that she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons 
it is for their safety  

beginning to be struck by defarge   manner  mr  lorry looked dubiously
at him  and led the way  both the women followed  the second woman being
the vengeance 

they passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might 
ascended the staircase of the new domicile  were admitted by jerry 
and found lucie weeping  alone  she was thrown into a transport by the
tidings mr  lorry gave her of her husband  and clasped the hand that
delivered his note  little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night  and might  but for a chance  have done to him 

      dearest   take courage   i am well  and your father has
      influence around me   you cannot answer this 
      kiss our child for me  

that was all the writing  it was so much  however  to her who received
it  that she turned from defarge to his wife  and kissed one of the
hands that knitted  it was a passionate  loving  thankful  womanly
action  but the hand made no response  dropped cold and heavy  and took
to its knitting again 

there was something in its touch that gave lucie a check  she stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom  and  with her hands yet at her
neck  looked terrified at madame defarge  madame defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold  impassive stare 

 my dear   said mr  lorry  striking in to explain   there are frequent
risings in the streets  and  although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you  madame defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times  to the end that she may know them  that she
may identify them  i believe   said mr  lorry  rather halting in his
reassuring words  as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more   i state the case  citizen defarge  

defarge looked gloomily at his wife  and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence 

 you had better  lucie   said mr  lorry  doing all he could to
propitiate  by tone and manner   have the dear child here  and our
good pross  our good pross  defarge  is an english lady  and knows no
french  

the lady in question  whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner  was not to be shaken by distress and  danger 
appeared with folded arms  and observed in english to the vengeance 
whom her eyes first encountered   well  i am sure  boldface  i hope
 you  are pretty well   she also bestowed a british cough on madame
defarge  but  neither of the two took much heed of her 

 is that his child   said madame defarge  stopping in her work for the
first time  and pointing her knitting needle at little lucie as if it
were the finger of fate 

 yes  madame   answered mr  lorry   this is our poor prisoner   darling
daughter  and only child  

the shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child  that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her  and held her to her breast  the
shadow attendant on madame defarge and her party seemed then to fall 
threatening and dark  on both the mother and the child 

 it is enough  my husband   said madame defarge   i have seen them  we
may go  

but  the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it  not visible and
presented  but indistinct and withheld  to alarm lucie into saying  as
she laid her appealing hand on madame defarge   dress 

 you will be good to my poor husband  you will do him no harm  you will
help me to see him if you can  

 your husband is not my business here   returned madame defarge  looking
down at her with perfect composure   it is the daughter of your father
who is my business here  

 for my sake  then  be merciful to my husband  for my child   sake  she
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful  we are more
afraid of you than of these others  

madame defarge received it as a compliment  and looked at her husband 
defarge  who had been uneasily biting his thumb nail and looking at her 
collected his face into a sterner expression 

 what is it that your husband says in that little letter   asked madame
defarge  with a lowering smile   influence  he says something touching
influence  

 that my father   said lucie  hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast  but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it   has
much influence around him  

 surely it will release him   said madame defarge   let it do so  

 as a wife and mother   cried lucie  most earnestly   i implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess  against
my innocent husband  but to use it in his behalf  o sister woman  think
of me  as a wife and mother  

madame defarge looked  coldly as ever  at the suppliant  and said 
turning to her friend the vengeance 

 the wives and mothers we have been used to see  since we were as little
as this child  and much less  have not been greatly considered  we have
known  their  husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them 
often enough  all our lives  we have seen our sister women suffer  in
themselves and in their children  poverty  nakedness  hunger  thirst 
sickness  misery  oppression and neglect of all kinds  

 we have seen nothing else   returned the vengeance 

 we have borne this a long time   said madame defarge  turning her eyes
again upon lucie   judge you  is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now  

she resumed her knitting and went out  the vengeance followed  defarge
went last  and closed the door 

 courage  my dear lucie   said mr  lorry  as he raised her   courage 
courage  so far all goes well with us  much  much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls  cheer up  and have a thankful heart  

 i am not thankless  i hope  but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes  

 tut  tut   said mr  lorry   what is this despondency in the brave
little breast  a shadow indeed  no substance in it  lucie  

but the shadow of the manner of these defarges was dark upon himself 
for all that  and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly 




iv  calm in storm


doctor manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence  so much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of lucie was so well concealed from her  that
not until long afterwards  when france and she were far apart  did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace  that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror  and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain  she only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons  that all political prisoners had been in danger  and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered 

to mr  lorry  the doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell  that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of la force  that  in the prison he had
found a self appointed tribunal sitting  before which the prisoners were
brought singly  and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred  or to be released  or  in a few cases  to be sent back
to their cells  that  presented by his conductors to this tribunal  he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the bastille  that  one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him  and that this
man was defarge 

that  hereupon he had ascertained  through the registers on the table 
that his son in law was among the living prisoners  and had pleaded hard
to the tribunal  of whom some members were asleep and some awake  some
dirty with murder and some clean  some sober and some not  for his life
and liberty  that  in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system  it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court  and
examined  that  he seemed on the point of being at once released  when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check  not intelligible
to the doctor   which led to a few words of secret conference  that 
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody  but should  for his sake  be held
inviolate in safe custody  that  immediately  on a signal  the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again  but  that he  the
doctor  had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son in law was  through no malice or mischance 
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings  that he had obtained the permission  and
had remained in that hall of blood until the danger was over 

the sights he had seen there  with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals  shall remain untold  the mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved  had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces  one prisoner there was  he said  who had
been discharged into the street free  but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out  being besought to go to him and dress
the wound  the doctor had passed out at the same gate  and had found him
in the arms of a company of samaritans  who were seated on the bodies
of their victims  with an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare  they had helped the healer  and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude  had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot  had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful  that the doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands  and swooned away in the midst of it 

as mr  lorry received these confidences  and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixty two years of age  a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger 

but  he had never seen his friend in his present aspect  he had never
at all known him in his present character  for the first time the doctor
felt  now  that his suffering was strength and power  for the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire  he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughter   husband  and deliver him 
 it all tended to a good end  my friend  it was not mere waste and ruin 
as my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself  i will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her  by the aid
of heaven i will do it   thus  doctor manette  and when jarvis lorry saw
the kindled eyes  the resolute face  the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped  like a
clock  for so many years  and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness  he believed 

greater things than the doctor had at that time to contend with  would
have yielded before his persevering purpose  while he kept himself
in his place  as a physician  whose business was with all degrees
of mankind  bond and free  rich and poor  bad and good  he used his
personal influence so wisely  that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons  and among them of la force  he could now assure lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone  but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners  he saw her husband weekly  and brought sweet
messages to her  straight from his lips  sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her  though never by the doctor   hand   but she was
not permitted to write to him  for  among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons  the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad 

this new life of the doctor   was an anxious life  no doubt  still  the
sagacious mr  lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it 
nothing unbecoming tinged the pride  it was a natural and worthy one 
but he observed it as a curiosity  the doctor knew  that up to that
time  his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend  with his personal affliction  deprivation  and weakness 
now that this was changed  and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for charles  
ultimate safety and deliverance  he became so far exalted by the change 
that he took the lead and direction  and required them as the weak  to
trust to him as the strong  the preceding relative positions of himself
and lucie were reversed  yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them  for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him   all
curious to see   thought mr  lorry  in his amiably shrewd way   but all
natural and right  so  take the lead  my dear friend  and keep it  it
couldn   be in better hands  

but  though the doctor tried hard  and never ceased trying  to get
charles darnay set at liberty  or at least to get him brought to trial 
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him  the new
era began  the king was tried  doomed  and beheaded  the republic of
liberty  equality  fraternity  or death  declared for victory or death
against the world in arms  the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of notre dame  three hundred thousand men  summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth  rose from all the varying soils
of france  as if the dragon   teeth had been sown broadcast  and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain  on rock  in gravel  and
alluvial mud  under the bright sky of the south and under the clouds of
the north  in fell and forest  in the vineyards and the olive grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn  along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers  and in the sand of the sea shore 
what private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the year
one of liberty  the deluge rising from below  not falling from above 
and with the windows of heaven shut  not opened 

there was no pause  no pity  no peace  no interval of relenting rest  no
measurement of time  though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young  and the evening and morning were the first day  other
count of time there was none  hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation  as it is in the fever of one patient  now  breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city  the executioner showed the people the
head of the king  and now  it seemed almost in the same breath  the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery  to turn it grey 

and yet  observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases  the time was long  while it flamed by so fast  a
revolutionary tribunal in the capital  and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land  a law of the suspected 
which struck away all security for liberty or life  and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one  prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence  and could obtain no hearing 
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things  and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old 
above all  one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world  the figure of the
sharp female called la guillotine 

it was the popular theme for jests  it was the best cure for headache 
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey  it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion  it was the national razor which
shaved close  who kissed la guillotine  looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack  it was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race  it superseded the cross  models of it were worn on breasts
from which the cross was discarded  and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the cross was denied 

it sheared off heads so many  that it  and the ground it most polluted 
were a rotten red  it was taken to pieces  like a toy puzzle for a young
devil  and was put together again when the occasion wanted it  it hushed
the eloquent  struck down the powerful  abolished the beautiful and
good  twenty two friends of high public mark  twenty one living and one
dead  it had lopped the heads off  in one morning  in as many minutes 
the name of the strong man of old scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it  but  so armed  he was stronger than his
namesake  and blinder  and tore away the gates of god   own temple every
day 

among these terrors  and the brood belonging to them  the doctor walked
with a steady head  confident in his power  cautiously persistent in his
end  never doubting that he would save lucie   husband at last  yet the
current of the time swept by  so strong and deep  and carried the time
away so fiercely  that charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the doctor was thus steady and confident  so much more
wicked and distracted had the revolution grown in that december month 
that the rivers of the south were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night  and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun  still  the doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head  no man better known than he  in paris at
that day  no man in a stranger situation  silent  humane  indispensable
in hospital and prison  using his art equally among assassins and
victims  he was a man apart  in the exercise of his skill  the
appearance and the story of the bastille captive removed him from all
other men  he was not suspected or brought in question  any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before  or were
a spirit moving among mortals 




   the wood sawyer


one year and three months  during all that time lucie was never
sure  from hour to hour  but that the guillotine would strike off her
husband   head next day  every day  through the stony streets  the
tumbrils now jolted heavily  filled with condemned  lovely girls  bright
women  brown haired  black haired  and grey  youths  stalwart men and
old  gentle born and peasant born  all red wine for la guillotine  all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons 
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst 
liberty  equality  fraternity  or death   the last  much the easiest to
bestow  o guillotine 

if the suddenness of her calamity  and the whirling wheels of the time 
had stunned the doctor   daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair  it would but have been with her as it was with many  but  from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of saint antoine  she had been true to her duties  she was
truest to them in the season of trial  as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be 

as soon as they were established in their new residence  and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations  she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there  everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time  little lucie she taught 
as regularly  as if they had all been united in their english home  the
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited  the little preparations for his speedy
return  the setting aside of his chair and his books  these  and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially  among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death  were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind 

she did not greatly alter in appearance  the plain dark dresses  akin to
mourning dresses  which she and her child wore  were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days  she lost her colour 
and the old and intent expression was a constant  not an occasional 
thing  otherwise  she remained very pretty and comely  sometimes  at
night on kissing her father  she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day  and would say that her sole reliance  under heaven 
was on him  he always resolutely answered   nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge  and i know that i can save him  lucie  

they had not made the round of their changed life many weeks  when her
father said to her  on coming home one evening 

 my dear  there is an upper window in the prison  to which charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon  when he can get to
it  which depends on many uncertainties and incidents  he might see you
in the street  he thinks  if you stood in a certain place that i can
show you  but you will not be able to see him  my poor child  and even
if you could  it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition  

 o show me the place  my father  and i will go there every day  

from that time  in all weathers  she waited there two hours  as the
clock struck two  she was there  and at four she turned resignedly away 
when it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her  they
went together  at other times she was alone  but  she never missed a
single day 

it was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street  the hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning  was the only house at that
end  all else was wall  on the third day of her being there  he noticed
her 

 good day  citizeness  

 good day  citizen  

this mode of address was now prescribed by decree  it had been
established voluntarily some time ago  among the more thorough patriots 
but  was now law for everybody 

 walking here again  citizeness  

 you see me  citizen  

the wood sawyer  who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture  he
had once been a mender of roads   cast a glance at the prison  pointed
at the prison  and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars  peeped through them jocosely 

 but it   not my business   said he  and went on sawing his wood 

next day he was looking out for her  and accosted her the moment she
appeared 

 what  walking here again  citizeness  

 yes  citizen  

 ah  a child too  your mother  is it not  my little citizeness  

 do i say yes  mamma   whispered little lucie  drawing close to her 

 yes  dearest  

 yes  citizen  

 ah  but it   not my business  my work is my business  see my saw  i
call it my little guillotine  la  la  la  la  la  la  and off his head
comes  

the billet fell as he spoke  and he threw it into a basket 

 i call myself the samson of the firewood guillotine  see here again 
loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  loo  and off  her  head comes  now  a child 
tickle  tickle  pickle  pickle  and off  its  head comes  all the
family  

lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket  but it was
impossible to be there while the wood sawyer was at work  and not be in
his sight  thenceforth  to secure his good will  she always spoke to him
first  and often gave him drink money  which he readily received 

he was an inquisitive fellow  and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates  and in lifting her heart
up to her husband  she would come to herself to find him looking at her 
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work   but it  
not my business   he would generally say at those times  and would
briskly fall to his sawing again 

in all weathers  in the snow and frost of winter  in the bitter winds of
spring  in the hot sunshine of summer  in the rains of autumn  and again
in the snow and frost of winter  lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place  and every day on leaving it  she kissed the prison wall 
her husband saw her  so she learned from her father  it might be once in
five or six times  it might be twice or thrice running  it might be  not
for a week or a fortnight together  it was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served  and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day  seven days a week 

these occupations brought her round to the december month  wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head  on a lightly snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner  it was a day of some wild
rejoicing  and a festival  she had seen the houses  as she came along 
decorated with little pikes  and with little red caps stuck upon them 
also  with tricoloured ribbons  also  with the standard inscription
 tricoloured letters were the favourite   republic one and indivisible 
liberty  equality  fraternity  or death 

the miserable shop of the wood sawyer was so small  that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend  he had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him  however  who had squeezed death in
with most inappropriate difficulty  on his house top  he displayed pike
and cap  as a good citizen must  and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his  little sainte guillotine   for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised  his shop was shut and he
was not there  which was a relief to lucie  and left her quite alone 

but  he was not far off  for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along  which filled her with fear  a moment
afterwards  and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall  in the midst of whom was the wood sawyer hand in hand with
the vengeance  there could not be fewer than five hundred people  and
they were dancing like five thousand demons  there was no other music
than their own singing  they danced to the popular revolution song 
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison 
men and women danced together  women danced together  men danced
together  as hazard had brought them together  at first  they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags  but  as they
filled the place  and stopped to dance about lucie  some ghastly
apparition of a dance figure gone raving mad arose among them  they
advanced  retreated  struck at one another   hands  clutched at one
another   heads  spun round alone  caught one another and spun round
in pairs  until many of them dropped  while those were down  the rest
linked hand in hand  and all spun round together  then the ring broke 
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once  began again  struck  clutched  and tore  and then
reversed the spin  and all spun round another way  suddenly they stopped
again  paused  struck out the time afresh  formed into lines the width
of the public way  and  with their heads low down and their hands high
up  swooped screaming off  no fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance  it was so emphatically a fallen sport  a something  once
innocent  delivered over to all devilry  a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood  bewildering the senses  and steeling the
heart  such grace as was visible in it  made it the uglier  showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become  the maidenly
bosom bared to this  the pretty almost child   head thus distracted  the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt  were types of
the disjointed time 

this was the carmagnole  as it passed  leaving lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood sawyer   house  the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft  as if it had never been 

 o my father   for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand   such a cruel  bad sight  

 i know  my dear  i know  i have seen it many times  don   be
frightened  not one of them would harm you  

 i am not frightened for myself  my father  but when i think of my
husband  and the mercies of these people   

 we will set him above their mercies very soon  i left him climbing to
the window  and i came to tell you  there is no one here to see  you may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof  

 i do so  father  and i send him my soul with it  

 you cannot see him  my poor dear  

 no  father   said lucie  yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand 
 no  

a footstep in the snow  madame defarge   i salute you  citizeness  
from the doctor   i salute you  citizen   this in passing  nothing more 
madame defarge gone  like a shadow over the white road 

 give me your arm  my love  pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage  for his sake  that was well done   they had left the spot 
 it shall not be in vain  charles is summoned for to morrow  

 for to morrow  

 there is no time to lose  i am well prepared  but there are precautions
to be taken  that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the tribunal  he has not received the notice yet  but i know
that he will presently be summoned for to morrow  and removed to the
conciergerie  i have timely information  you are not afraid  

she could scarcely answer   i trust in you  

 do so  implicitly  your suspense is nearly ended  my darling  he shall
be restored to you within a few hours  i have encompassed him with every
protection  i must see lorry  

he stopped  there was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing  they
both knew too well what it meant  one  two  three  three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow 

 i must see lorry   the doctor repeated  turning her another way 

the staunch old gentleman was still in his trust  had never left it  he
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national  what he could save for the owners  he saved  no
better man living to hold fast by what tellson   had in keeping  and to
hold his peace 

a murky red and yellow sky  and a rising mist from the seine  denoted
the approach of darkness  it was almost dark when they arrived at the
bank  the stately residence of monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted  above a heap of dust and ashes in the court  ran the letters 
national property  republic one and indivisible  liberty  equality 
fraternity  or death 

who could that be with mr  lorry  the owner of the riding coat upon the
chair  who must not be seen  from whom newly arrived  did he come out 
agitated and surprised  to take his favourite in his arms  to whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words  when  raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued 
he said   removed to the conciergerie  and summoned for to morrow  




vi  triumph


the dread tribunal of five judges  public prosecutor  and determined
jury  sat every day  their lists went forth every evening  and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners  the
standard gaoler joke was   come out and listen to the evening paper  you
inside there  

 charles evremonde  called darnay  

so at last began the evening paper at la force 

when a name was called  its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded  charles
evremonde  called darnay  had reason to know the usage  he had seen
hundreds pass away so 

his bloated gaoler  who wore spectacles to read with  glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place  and went through the
list  making a similar short pause at each name  there were twenty three
names  but only twenty were responded to  for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten  and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten  the list was read  in the vaulted chamber
where darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival  every one of those had perished in the massacre  every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with  had died on the
scaffold 

there were hurried words of farewell and kindness  but the parting was
soon over  it was the incident of every day  and the society of la force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert  for that evening  they crowded to the grates and shed tears
there  but  twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled  and the time was  at best  short to the lock up hour  when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night  the prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling  their ways arose out of the condition of the
time  similarly  though with a subtle difference  a species of fervour
or intoxication  known  without doubt  to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily  and to die by it  was not mere
boastfulness  but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind  in
seasons of pestilence  some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease  a terrible passing inclination to die of it  and all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts  only needing circumstances to evoke
them 

the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark  the night in its
vermin haunted cells was long and cold  next day  fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before charles darnay   name was called  all the fifteen
were condemned  and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half 

 charles evremonde  called darnay   was at length arraigned 

his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats  but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head dress otherwise prevailing  looking
at the jury and the turbulent audience  he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed  and that the felons were trying the
honest men  the lowest  cruelest  and worst populace of a city  never
without its quantity of low  cruel  and bad  were the directing
spirits of the scene  noisily commenting  applauding  disapproving 
anticipating  and precipitating the result  without a check  of the men 
the greater part were armed in various ways  of the women  some wore
knives  some daggers  some ate and drank as they looked on  many
knitted  among these last  was one  with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked  she was in a front row  by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the barrier  but whom he directly
remembered as defarge  he noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear  and that she seemed to be his wife  but  what he most noticed
in the two figures was  that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be  they never looked towards him  they seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination  and they looked at
the jury  but at nothing else  under the president sat doctor manette 
in his usual quiet dress  as well as the prisoner could see  he and mr 
lorry were the only men there  unconnected with the tribunal  who
wore their usual clothes  and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
carmagnole 

charles evremonde  called darnay  was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant  whose life was forfeit to the republic  under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of death  it was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to france  there he was  and there was
the decree  he had been taken in france  and his head was demanded 

 take off his head   cried the audience   an enemy to the republic  

the president rang his bell to silence those cries  and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
england 

undoubtedly it was 

was he not an emigrant then  what did he call himself 

not an emigrant  he hoped  within the sense and spirit of the law 

why not  the president desired to know 

because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him  and a station that was distasteful to him  and had left
his country  he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the tribunal was in use  to live by his own industry in
england  rather than on the industry of the overladen people of france 

what proof had he of this 

he handed in the names of two witnesses  theophile gabelle  and
alexandre manette 

but he had married in england  the president reminded him 

true  but not an english woman 

a citizeness of france 

yes  by birth 

her name and family 

 lucie manette  only daughter of doctor manette  the good physician who
sits there  

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience  cries in exaltation
of the well known good physician rent the hall  so capriciously were
the people moved  that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before  as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him 

on these few steps of his dangerous way  charles darnay had set his foot
according to doctor manette   reiterated instructions  the same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him  and had prepared every
inch of his road 

the president asked  why had he returned to france when he did  and not
sooner 

he had not returned sooner  he replied  simply because he had no means
of living in france  save those he had resigned  whereas  in england 
he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature 
he had returned when he did  on the pressing and written entreaty of
a french citizen  who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence  he had come back  to save a citizen   life  and to bear his
testimony  at whatever personal hazard  to the truth  was that criminal
in the eyes of the republic 

the populace cried enthusiastically   no   and the president rang his
bell to quiet them  which it did not  for they continued to cry  no  
until they left off  of their own will 

the president required the name of that citizen  the accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness  he also referred with confidence
to the citizen   letter  which had been taken from him at the barrier 
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the president 

the doctor had taken care that it should be there  had assured him that
it would be there  and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read  citizen gabelle was called to confirm it  and did so  citizen
gabelle hinted  with infinite delicacy and politeness  that in the
pressure of business imposed on the tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the republic with which it had to deal  he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the abbaye  in fact  had rather passed out
of the tribunal   patriotic remembrance  until three days ago  when he
had been summoned before it  and had been set at liberty on the jury  
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered  as to himself  by the surrender of the citizen evremonde 
called darnay 

doctor manette was next questioned  his high personal popularity 
and the clearness of his answers  made a great impression  but  as he
proceeded  as he showed that the accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment  that  the accused had remained in
england  always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile  that  so far from being in favour with the aristocrat
government there  he had actually been tried for his life by it  as
the foe of england and friend of the united states  as he brought these
circumstances into view  with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness  the jury and the
populace became one  at last  when he appealed by name to monsieur
lorry  an english gentleman then and there present  who  like himself 
had been a witness on that english trial and could corroborate his
account of it  the jury declared that they had heard enough  and that
they were ready with their votes if the president were content to
receive them 

at every vote  the jurymen voted aloud and individually   the populace
set up a shout of applause  all the voices were in the prisoner  
favour  and the president declared him free 

then  began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness  or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy  or which they regarded as some set off against
their swollen account of cruel rage  no man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable  it is probable 
to a blending of all the three  with the second predominating  no sooner
was the acquittal pronounced  than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time  and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him  that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion  none the less because he knew very well  that the very same
people  carried by another current  would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity  to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets 

his removal  to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried 
rescued him from these caresses for the moment  five were to be tried
together  next  as enemies of the republic  forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed  so quick was the tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost  that these five came down to
him before he left the place  condemned to die within twenty four
hours  the first of them told him so  with the customary prison sign
of death  a raised finger  and they all added in words   long live the
republic  

the five had had  it is true  no audience to lengthen their proceedings 
for when he and doctor manette emerged from the gate  there was a great
crowd about it  in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
court  except two  for which he looked in vain  on his coming out  the
concourse made at him anew  weeping  embracing  and shouting  all by
turns and all together  until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted  seemed to run mad  like the people on the
shore 

they put him into a great chair they had among them  and which they had
taken either out of the court itself  or one of its rooms or passages 
over the chair they had thrown a red flag  and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top  in this car of triumph  not
even the doctor   entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on men   shoulders  with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him 
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces  that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion  and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the guillotine 

in wild dreamlike procession  embracing whom they met and pointing
him out  they carried him on  reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing republican colour  in winding and tramping through them  as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye  they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived  her father
had gone on before  to prepare her  and when her husband stood upon his
feet  she dropped insensible in his arms 

as he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd  so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen  a few of the people fell to dancing  instantly  all the
rest fell to dancing  and the courtyard overflowed with the carmagnole 
then  they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the goddess of liberty  and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets  and along the river   bank 
and over the bridge  the carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away 

after grasping the doctor   hand  as he stood victorious and proud
before him  after grasping the hand of mr  lorry  who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the carmagnole 
after kissing little lucie  who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck  and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful pross who
lifted her  he took his wife in his arms  and carried her up to their
rooms 

 lucie  my own  i am safe  

 o dearest charles  let me thank god for this on my knees as i have
prayed to him  

they all reverently bowed their heads and hearts  when she was again in
his arms  he said to her 

 and now speak to your father  dearest  no other man in all this france
could have done what he has done for me  

she laid her head upon her father   breast  as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast  long  long ago  he was happy in the return he
had made her  he was recompensed for his suffering  he was proud of his
strength   you must not be weak  my darling   he remonstrated   don  
tremble so  i have saved him  




vii  a knock at the door


 i have saved him   it was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back  he was really here  and yet his wife trembled  and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her 

all the air round was so thick and dark  the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful  the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice  it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her  every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched  that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be 
the shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall  and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets  her mind pursued
them  looking for him among the condemned  and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more 

her father  cheering her  showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman   weakness  which was wonderful to see  no garret  no shoemaking 
no one hundred and five  north tower  now  he had accomplished the task
he had set himself  his promise was redeemed  he had saved charles  let
them all lean upon him 

their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind  not only because that was
the safest way of life  involving the least offence to the people  but
because they were not rich  and charles  throughout his imprisonment 
had had to pay heavily for his bad food  and for his guard  and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners  partly on this account  and
partly to avoid a domestic spy  they kept no servant  the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate  rendered them
occasional service  and jerry  almost wholly transferred to them by
mr  lorry  had become their daily retainer  and had his bed there every
night 

it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty 
equality  fraternity  or death  that on the door or doorpost of every
house  the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size  at a certain convenient height from the ground  mr 
jerry cruncher   name  therefore  duly embellished the doorpost down
below  and  as the afternoon shadows deepened  the owner of that name
himself appeared  from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde  called
darnay 

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time  all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed  in the doctor   little household  as
in very many others  the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening  in small quantities and at various small
shops  to avoid attracting notice  and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy  was the general desire 

for some months past  miss pross and mr  cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors  the former carrying the money  the latter  the
basket  every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted  they fared forth on this duty  and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful  although miss pross  through her long
association with a french family  might have known as much of their
language as of her own  if she had had a mind  she had no mind in that
direction  consequently she knew no more of that  nonsense   as she was
pleased to call it  than mr  cruncher did  so her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article  and  if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted  to look round for that thing  lay hold
of it  and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded  she always
made a bargain for it  by holding up  as a statement of its just price 
one finger less than the merchant held up  whatever his number might be 

 now  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose eyes were red with felicity 
 if you are ready  i am  

jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss pross   service  he had worn
all his rust off long ago  but nothing would file his spiky head down 

 there   all manner of things wanted   said miss pross   and we shall
have a precious time of it  we want wine  among the rest  nice toasts
these redheads will be drinking  wherever we buy it  

 it will be much the same to your knowledge  miss  i should think  
retorted jerry   whether they drink your health or the old un    

 who   he   said miss pross 

mr  cruncher  with some diffidence  explained himself as meaning  old
nick    

 ha   said miss pross   it doesn   need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures  they have but one  and it   midnight murder 
and mischief  

 hush  dear  pray  pray  be cautious   cried lucie 

 yes  yes  yes  i ll be cautious   said miss pross   but i may say
among ourselves  that i do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round  going on in the
streets  now  ladybird  never you stir from that fire till i come back 
take care of the dear husband you have recovered  and don   move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now  till you see me again 
may i ask a question  doctor manette  before i go  

 i think you may take that liberty   the doctor answered  smiling 

 for gracious sake  don   talk about liberty  we have quite enough of
that   said miss pross 

 hush  dear  again   lucie remonstrated 

 well  my sweet   said miss pross  nodding her head emphatically   the
short and the long of it is  that i am a subject of his most gracious
majesty king george the third   miss pross curtseyed at the name   and
as such  my maxim is  confound their politics  frustrate their knavish
tricks  on him our hopes we fix  god save the king  

mr  cruncher  in an access of loyalty  growlingly repeated the words
after miss pross  like somebody at church 

 i am glad you have so much of the englishman in you  though i wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice   said miss pross  approvingly 
 but the question  doctor manette  is there   it was the good creature  
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all  and to come at it in this chance manner   is there any
prospect yet  of our getting out of this place  

 i fear not yet  it would be dangerous for charles yet  

 heigh ho hum   said miss pross  cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darling   golden hair in the light of the fire   then we
must have patience and wait  that   all  we must hold up our heads and
fight low  as my brother solomon used to say  now  mr  cruncher   don  
you move  ladybird  

they went out  leaving lucie  and her husband  her father  and the
child  by a bright fire  mr  lorry was expected back presently from the
banking house  miss pross had lighted the lamp  but had put it aside in
a corner  that they might enjoy the fire light undisturbed  little lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm  and he 
in a tone not rising much above a whisper  began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful fairy who had opened a prison wall and let out
a captive who had once done the fairy a service  all was subdued and
quiet  and lucie was more at ease than she had been 

 what is that   she cried  all at once 

 my dear   said her father  stopping in his story  and laying his hand
on hers   command yourself  what a disordered state you are in  the
least thing  nothing  startles you   you   your father   daughter  

 i thought  my father   said lucie  excusing herself  with a pale face
and in a faltering voice   that i heard strange feet upon the stairs  

 my love  the staircase is as still as death  

as he said the word  a blow was struck upon the door 

 oh father  father  what can this be  hide charles  save him  

 my child   said the doctor  rising  and laying his hand upon her
shoulder   i  have  saved him  what weakness is this  my dear  let me go
to the door  

he took the lamp in his hand  crossed the two intervening outer rooms 
and opened it  a rude clattering of feet over the floor  and four rough
men in red caps  armed with sabres and pistols  entered the room 

 the citizen evremonde  called darnay   said the first 

 who seeks him   answered darnay 

 i seek him  we seek him  i know you  evremonde  i saw you before the
tribunal to day  you are again the prisoner of the republic  

the four surrounded him  where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him 

 tell me how and why am i again a prisoner  

 it is enough that you return straight to the conciergerie  and will
know to morrow  you are summoned for to morrow  

doctor manette  whom this visitation had so turned into stone  that he
stood with the lamp in his hand  as if be woe a statue made to hold it 
moved after these words were spoken  put the lamp down  and confronting
the speaker  and taking him  not ungently  by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt  said 

 you know him  you have said  do you know me  

 yes  i know you  citizen doctor  

 we all know you  citizen doctor   said the other three 

he looked abstractedly from one to another  and said  in a lower voice 
after a pause 

 will you answer his question to me then  how does this happen  

 citizen doctor   said the first  reluctantly   he has been denounced to
the section of saint antoine  this citizen   pointing out the second who
had entered   is from saint antoine  

the citizen here indicated nodded his head  and added 

 he is accused by saint antoine  

 of what   asked the doctor 

 citizen doctor   said the first  with his former reluctance   ask no
more  if the republic demands sacrifices from you  without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them  the republic goes before all 
the people is supreme  evremonde  we are pressed  

 one word   the doctor entreated   will you tell me who denounced him  

 it is against rule   answered the first   but you can ask him of saint
antoine here  

the doctor turned his eyes upon that man  who moved uneasily on his
feet  rubbed his beard a little  and at length said 

 well  truly it is against rule  but he is denounced  and gravely  by
the citizen and citizeness defarge  and by one other  

 what other  

 do  you  ask  citizen doctor  

 yes  

 then   said he of saint antoine  with a strange look   you will be
answered to morrow  now  i am dumb  




viii  a hand at cards


happily unconscious of the new calamity at home  miss pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
pont neuf  reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make  mr  cruncher  with the basket  walked at her side  they
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed  had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people  and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers  it
was a raw evening  and the misty river  blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises  showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked  making guns for the army of the
republic  woe to the man who played tricks with  that  army  or got
undeserved promotion in it  better for him that his beard had never
grown  for the national razor shaved him close 

having purchased a few small articles of grocery  and a measure of oil
for the lamp  miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted 
after peeping into several wine shops  she stopped at the sign of the
good republican brutus of antiquity  not far from the national palace 
once  and twice  the tuileries  where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy  it had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed  and  though red with patriotic caps  was
not so red as the rest  sounding mr  cruncher  and finding him of her
opinion  miss pross resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity 
attended by her cavalier 

slightly observant of the smoky lights  of the people  pipe in mouth 
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes  of the one bare breasted 
bare armed  soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud  and of
the others listening to him  of the weapons worn  or laid aside to be
resumed  of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep  who in the
popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked  in that attitude 
like slumbering bears or dogs  the two outlandish customers approached
the counter  and showed what they wanted 

as their wine was measuring out  a man parted from another man in a
corner  and rose to depart  in going  he had to face miss pross  no
sooner did he face her  than miss pross uttered a scream  and clapped
her hands 

in a moment  the whole company were on their feet  that somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence  everybody looked to see somebody fall  but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other  the man with all
the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican  the woman 
evidently english 

what was said in this disappointing anti climax  by the disciples of the
good republican brutus of antiquity  except that it was something very
voluble and loud  would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss
pross and her protector  though they had been all ears  but  they had no
ears for anything in their surprise  for  it must be recorded  that
not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation  but 
mr  cruncher  though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account  was in a state of the greatest wonder 

 what is the matter   said the man who had caused miss pross to scream 
speaking in a vexed  abrupt voice  though in a low tone   and in
english 

 oh  solomon  dear solomon   cried miss pross  clapping her hands again 
 after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time 
do i find you here  

 don   call me solomon  do you want to be the death of me   asked the
man  in a furtive  frightened way 

 brother  brother   cried miss pross  bursting into tears   have i ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question  

 then hold your meddlesome tongue   said solomon   and come out  if you
want to speak to me  pay for your wine  and come out  who   this man  

miss pross  shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother  said through her tears   mr  cruncher  

 let him come out too   said solomon   does he think me a ghost  

apparently  mr  cruncher did  to judge from his looks  he said not a
word  however  and miss pross  exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine  as she did
so  solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus
of antiquity  and offered a few words of explanation in the french
language  which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits 

 now   said solomon  stopping at the dark street corner   what do you
want  

 how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from   cried miss pross   to give me such a greeting  and show me no
affection  

 there  confound it  there   said solomon  making a dab at miss pross  
lips with his own   now are you content  

miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence 

 if you expect me to be surprised   said her brother solomon   i am not
surprised  i knew you were here  i know of most people who are here  if
you really don   want to endanger my existence  which i half believe you
do  go your ways as soon as possible  and let me go mine  i am busy  i
am an official  

 my english brother solomon   mourned miss pross  casting up her
tear fraught eyes   that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country  an official among foreigners  and
such foreigners  i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his   

 i said so   cried her brother  interrupting   i knew it  you want to be
the death of me  i shall be rendered suspected  by my own sister  just
as i am getting on  

 the gracious and merciful heavens forbid   cried miss pross   far
rather would i never see you again  dear solomon  though i have ever
loved you truly  and ever shall  say but one affectionate word to me 
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us  and i will
detain you no longer  

good miss pross  as if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers  as if mr  lorry had not known it for a fact  years
ago  in the quiet corner in soho  that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her 

he was saying the affectionate word  however  with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed  which is invariably the case 
all the world over   when mr  cruncher  touching him on the shoulder 
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question 

 i say  might i ask the favour  as to whether your name is john solomon 
or solomon john  

the official turned towards him with sudden distrust  he had not
previously uttered a word 

 come   said mr  cruncher   speak out  you know    which  by the way 
was more than he could do himself    john solomon  or solomon john  she
calls you solomon  and she must know  being your sister  and  i  know
you re john  you know  which of the two goes first  and regarding that
name of pross  likewise  that warn   your name over the water  

 what do you mean  

 well  i don   know all i mean  for i can   call to mind what your name
was  over the water  

 no  

 no  but i ll swear it was a name of two syllables  

 indeed  

 yes    other one   was one syllable  i know you  you was a spy  witness
at the bailey  what  in the name of the father of lies  own father to
yourself  was you called at that time  

 barsad   said another voice  striking in 

 that   the name for a thousand pound   cried jerry 

the speaker who struck in  was sydney carton  he had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding coat  and he stood at mr  cruncher  
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself 

 don   be alarmed  my dear miss pross  i arrived at mr  lorry    to his
surprise  yesterday evening  we agreed that i would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well  or unless i could be useful  i present
myself here  to beg a little talk with your brother  i wish you had a
better employed brother than mr  barsad  i wish for your sake mr  barsad
was not a sheep of the prisons  

sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy  under the gaolers  the spy 
who was pale  turned paler  and asked him how he dared  

 i ll tell you   said sydney   i lighted on you  mr  barsad  coming out
of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls 
an hour or more ago  you have a face to be remembered  and i remember
faces well  made curious by seeing you in that connection  and having
a reason  to which you are no stranger  for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate  i walked in your
direction  i walked into the wine shop here  close after you  and
sat near you  i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation  and the rumour openly going about among your admirers  the
nature of your calling  and gradually  what i had done at random  seemed
to shape itself into a purpose  mr  barsad  

 what purpose   the spy asked 

 it would be troublesome  and might be dangerous  to explain in the
street  could you favour me  in confidence  with some minutes of your
company  at the office of tellson   bank  for instance  

 under a threat  

 oh  did i say that  

 then  why should i go there  

 really  mr  barsad  i can   say  if you can    

 do you mean that you won   say  sir   the spy irresolutely asked 

 you apprehend me very clearly  mr  barsad  i won    

carton   negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill  in such a business as he had in his secret mind 
and with such a man as he had to do with  his practised eye saw it  and
made the most of it 

 now  i told you so   said the spy  casting a reproachful look at his
sister   if any trouble comes of this  it   your doing  

 come  come  mr  barsad   exclaimed sydney   don   be ungrateful 
but for my great respect for your sister  i might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction  do you go with me to the bank  

 i ll hear what you have got to say  yes  i ll go with you  

 i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street  let me take your arm  miss pross  this is not a good city 
at this time  for you to be out in  unprotected  and as your escort
knows mr  barsad  i will invite him to mr  lorry   with us  are we
ready  come then  

miss pross recalled soon afterwards  and to the end of her life
remembered  that as she pressed her hands on sydney   arm and looked up
in his face  imploring him to do no hurt to solomon  there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes  which not only
contradicted his light manner  but changed and raised the man  she was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection  and with sydney   friendly reassurances  adequately to
heed what she observed 

they left her at the corner of the street  and carton led the way to mr 
lorry    which was within a few minutes  walk  john barsad  or solomon
pross  walked at his side 

mr  lorry had just finished his dinner  and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire  perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellson    who had looked
into the red coals at the royal george at dover  now a good many years
ago  he turned his head as they entered  and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger 

 miss pross   brother  sir   said sydney   mr  barsad  

 barsad   repeated the old gentleman   barsad  i have an association
with the name  and with the face  

 i told you you had a remarkable face  mr  barsad   observed carton 
coolly   pray sit down  

as he took a chair himself  he supplied the link that mr  lorry wanted 
by saying to him with a frown   witness at that trial   mr  lorry
immediately remembered  and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence 

 mr  barsad has been recognised by miss pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of   said sydney   and has acknowledged the
relationship  i pass to worse news  darnay has been arrested again  

struck with consternation  the old gentleman exclaimed   what do you
tell me  i left him safe and free within these two hours  and am about
to return to him  

 arrested for all that  when was it done  mr  barsad  

 just now  if at all  

 mr  barsad is the best authority possible  sir   said sydney   and i
have it from mr  barsad   communication to a friend and brother sheep
over a bottle of wine  that the arrest has taken place  he left the
messengers at the gate  and saw them admitted by the porter  there is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken  

mr  lorry   business eye read in the speaker   face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point  confused  but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind  he commanded himself  and was
silently attentive 

 now  i trust   said sydney to him   that the name and influence of
doctor manette may stand him in as good stead to morrow  you said he
would be before the tribunal again to morrow  mr  barsad    

 yes  i believe so  

   in as good stead to morrow as to day  but it may not be so  i own
to you  i am shaken  mr  lorry  by doctor manette   not having had the
power to prevent this arrest  

 he may not have known of it beforehand   said mr  lorry 

 but that very circumstance would be alarming  when we remember how
identified he is with his son in law  

 that   true   mr  lorry acknowledged  with his troubled hand at his
chin  and his troubled eyes on carton 

 in short   said sydney   this is a desperate time  when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes  let the doctor play the winning game  i
will play the losing one  no man   life here is worth purchase  any one
carried home by the people to day  may be condemned tomorrow  now  the
stake i have resolved to play for  in case of the worst  is a friend
in the conciergerie  and the friend i purpose to myself to win  is mr 
barsad  

 you need have good cards  sir   said the spy 

 i ll run them over  i ll see what i hold   mr  lorry  you know what a
brute i am  i wish you   give me a little brandy  

it was put before him  and he drank off a glassful  drank off another
glassful  pushed the bottle thoughtfully away 

 mr  barsad   he went on  in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards   sheep of the prisons  emissary of republican
committees  now turnkey  now prisoner  always spy and secret informer 
so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
frenchman  represents himself to his employers under a false name 
that   a very good card  mr  barsad  now in the employ of the republican
french government  was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
english government  the enemy of france and freedom  that   an excellent
card  inference clear as day in this region of suspicion  that mr 
barsad  still in the pay of the aristocratic english government  is the
spy of pitt  the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom 
the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find  that   a card not to be beaten  have you followed my
hand  mr  barsad  

 not to understand your play   returned the spy  somewhat uneasily 

 i play my ace  denunciation of mr  barsad to the nearest section
committee  look over your hand  mr  barsad  and see what you have  don  
hurry  

he drew the bottle near  poured out another glassful of brandy  and
drank it off  he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him  seeing it  he
poured out and drank another glassful 

 look over your hand carefully  mr  barsad  take time  

it was a poorer hand than he suspected  mr  barsad saw losing cards
in it that sydney carton knew nothing of  thrown out of his honourable
employment in england  through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there  not because he was not wanted there  our english reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date  he knew that he had crossed the channel  and accepted service in
france  first  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there  gradually  as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives  he
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint
antoine and defarge   wine shop  had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning doctor manette   imprisonment 
release  and history  as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the defarges  and tried them on madame
defarge  and had broken down with them signally  he always remembered
with fear and trembling  that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her  and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved 
he had since seen her  in the section of saint antoine  over and over
again produce her knitted registers  and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up  he knew  as every one employed as
he was did  that he was never safe  that flight was impossible  that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe  and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror  a word might bring it down upon him  once denounced  and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind  he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs  would produce against him that fatal register  and would quash
his last chance of life  besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified  here were surely cards enough of one black suit  to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over 

 you scarcely seem to like your hand   said sydney  with the greatest
composure   do you play  

 i think  sir   said the spy  in the meanest manner  as he turned to mr 
lorry   i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence  to
put it to this other gentleman  so much your junior  whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace
of which he has spoken  i admit that  i  am a spy  and that it is
considered a discreditable station  though it must be filled by
somebody  but this gentleman is no spy  and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one  

 i play my ace  mr  barsad   said carton  taking the answer on himself 
and looking at his watch   without any scruple  in a very few minutes  

 i should have hoped  gentlemen both   said the spy  always striving to
hook mr  lorry into the discussion   that your respect for my sister   

 i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother   said sydney carton 

 you think not  sir  

 i have thoroughly made up my mind about it  

the smooth manner of the spy  curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress  and probably with his usual demeanour 
received such a check from the inscrutability of carton   who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he   that it faltered here and
failed him  while he was at a loss  carton said  resuming his former air
of contemplating cards 

 and indeed  now i think again  i have a strong impression that i
have another good card here  not yet enumerated  that friend and
fellow sheep  who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons 
who was he  

 french  you don   know him   said the spy  quickly 

 french  eh   repeated carton  musing  and not appearing to notice him
at all  though he echoed his word   well  he may be  

 is  i assure you   said the spy   though it   not important  

 though it   not important   repeated carton  in the same mechanical
way   though it   not important  no  it   not important  no  yet i know
the face  

 i think not  i am sure not  it can   be   said the spy 

 it can   be   muttered sydney carton  retrospectively  and idling his
glass  which fortunately was a small one  again   can   be  spoke good
french  yet like a foreigner  i thought  

 provincial   said the spy 

 no  foreign   cried carton  striking his open hand on the table  as a
light broke clearly on his mind   cly  disguised  but the same man  we
had that man before us at the old bailey  

 now  there you are hasty  sir   said barsad  with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side   there you really give
me an advantage over you  cly  who i will unreservedly admit  at this
distance of time  was a partner of mine  has been dead several years  i
attended him in his last illness  he was buried in london  at the church
of saint pancras in the fields  his unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains  but i helped
to lay him in his coffin  

here  mr  lorry became aware  from where he sat  of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall  tracing it to its source  he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on mr  cruncher   head 

 let us be reasonable   said the spy   and let us be fair  to show you
how mistaken you are  and what an unfounded assumption yours is  i will
lay before you a certificate of cly   burial  which i happened to have
carried in my pocket book   with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it   ever since  there it is  oh  look at it  look at it  you may take
it in your hand  it   no forgery  

here  mr  lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate  and
mr  cruncher rose and stepped forward  his hair could not have been more
violently on end  if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that jack built 

unseen by the spy  mr  cruncher stood at his side  and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff 

 that there roger cly  master   said mr  cruncher  with a taciturn and
iron bound visage   so  you  put him in his coffin  

 i did  

 who took him out of it  

barsad leaned back in his chair  and stammered   what do you mean  

 i mean   said mr  cruncher   that he warn   never in it  no  not he 
i ll have my head took off  if he was ever in it  

the spy looked round at the two gentlemen  they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at jerry 

 i tell you   said jerry   that you buried paving stones and earth in
that there coffin  don   go and tell me that you buried cly  it was a
take in  me and two more knows it  

 how do you know it  

 what   that to you  ecod   growled mr  cruncher   it   you i have got a
old grudge again  is it  with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen 
i   catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea  

sydney carton  who  with mr  lorry  had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business  here requested mr  cruncher to moderate and
explain himself 

 at another time  sir   he returned  evasively   the present time is
ill conwenient for explainin   what i stand to  is  that he knows well
wot that there cly was never in that there coffin  let him say he was 
in so much as a word of one syllable  and i ll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea   mr  cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer   or i ll out and announce him  

 humph  i see one thing   said carton   i hold another card  mr  barsad 
impossible  here in raging paris  with suspicion filling the air  for
you to outlive denunciation  when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself  who  moreover  has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again 
a plot in the prisons  of the foreigner against the republic  a strong
card  a certain guillotine card  do you play  

 no   returned the spy   i throw up  i confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob  that i only got away from england at the risk
of being ducked to death  and that cly was so ferreted up and down  that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham  though how this
man knows it was a sham  is a wonder of wonders to me  

 never you trouble your head about this man   retorted the contentious
mr  cruncher   you ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman  and look here  once more    mr  cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality   i   catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea  

the sheep of the prisons turned from him to sydney carton  and said 
with more decision   it has come to a point  i go on duty soon  and
can   overstay my time  you told me you had a proposal  what is it 
now  it is of no use asking too much of me  ask me to do anything in my
office  putting my head in great extra danger  and i had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent  in short 
i should make that choice  you talk of desperation  we are all desperate
here  remember  i may denounce you if i think proper  and i can swear my
way through stone walls  and so can others  now  what do you want with
me  

 not very much  you are a turnkey at the conciergerie  

 i tell you once for all  there is no such thing as an escape possible  
said the spy  firmly 

 why need you tell me what i have not asked  you are a turnkey at the
conciergerie  

 i am sometimes  

 you can be when you choose  

 i can pass in and out when i choose  

sydney carton filled another glass with brandy  poured it slowly out
upon the hearth  and watched it as it dropped  it being all spent  he
said  rising 

 so far  we have spoken before these two  because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me  come
into the dark room here  and let us have one final word alone  




ix  the game made


while sydney carton and the sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room  speaking so low that not a sound was heard  mr  lorry looked
at jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust  that honest tradesman  
manner of receiving the look  did not inspire confidence  he changed the
leg on which he rested  as often as if he had fifty of those limbs 
and were trying them all  he examined his finger nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention  and whenever mr  lorry   eye caught
his  he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it  which is seldom  if ever  known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character 

 jerry   said mr  lorry   come here  

mr  cruncher came forward sideways  with one of his shoulders in advance
of him 

 what have you been  besides a messenger  

after some cogitation  accompanied with an intent look at his patron 
mr  cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying   agicultooral
character  

 my mind misgives me much   said mr  lorry  angrily shaking a forefinger
at him   that you have used the respectable and great house of tellson  
as a blind  and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description  if you have  don   expect me to befriend you when you
get back to england  if you have  don   expect me to keep your secret 
tellson   shall not be imposed upon  

 i hope  sir   pleaded the abashed mr  cruncher   that a gentleman like
yourself wot i ve had the honour of odd jobbing till i   grey at it 
would think twice about harming of me  even if it wos so  i don   say it
is  but even if it wos  and which it is to be took into account that if
it wos  it wouldn    even then  be all o  one side  there   be two sides
to it  there might be medical doctors at the present hour  a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don   pick up his
fardens  fardens  no  nor yet his half fardens  half fardens  no  nor
yet his quarter  a banking away like smoke at tellson    and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly  a going in and going
out to their own carriages  ah  equally like smoke  if not more so 
well  that  ud be imposing  too  on tellson    for you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander  and here   mrs  cruncher  or leastways wos
in the old england times  and would be to morrow  if cause given 
a floppin  again the business to that degree as is ruinating  stark
ruinating  whereas them medical doctors  wives don   flop  catch  em at
it  or  if they flop  their floppings goes in favour of more patients 
and how can you rightly have one without   other  then  wot with
undertakers  and wot with parish clerks  and wot with sextons  and wot
with private watchmen  all awaricious and all in it   a man wouldn   get
much by it  even if it wos so  and wot little a man did get  would never
prosper with him  mr  lorry  he   never have no good of it  he   want
all along to be out of the line  if he  could see his way out  being
once in  even if it wos so  

 ugh   cried mr  lorry  rather relenting  nevertheless   i am shocked at
the sight of you  

 now  what i would humbly offer to you  sir   pursued mr  cruncher 
 even if it wos so  which i don   say it is   

 don   prevaricate   said mr  lorry 

 no  i will  not   sir   returned mr  crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice   which i don   say it is  wot i
would humbly offer to you  sir  would be this  upon that there stool  at
that there bar  sets that there boy of mine  brought up and growed up to
be a man  wot will errand you  message you  general light job you  till
your heels is where your head is  if such should be your wishes  if it
wos so  which i still don   say it is  for i will not prewaricate to
you  sir   let that there boy keep his father   place  and take care of
his mother  don   blow upon that boy   father  do not do it  sir  and
let that father go into the line of the reg lar diggin   and make amends
for what he would have undug  if it wos so  by diggin  of  em in with
a will  and with conwictions respectin  the futur  keepin  of  em safe 
that  mr  lorry   said mr  cruncher  wiping his forehead with his
arm  as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse   is wot i would respectfully offer to you  sir  a man don  
see all this here a goin  on dreadful round him  in the way of subjects
without heads  dear me  plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that  without havin  his serious thoughts of
things  and these here would be mine  if it wos so  entreatin  of you
fur to bear in mind that wot i said just now  i up and said in the good
cause when i might have kep  it back  

 that at least is true   said mr  lorry   say no more now  it may be
that i shall yet stand your friend  if you deserve it  and repent in
action  not in words  i want no more words  

mr  cruncher knuckled his forehead  as sydney carton and the spy
returned from the dark room   adieu  mr  barsad   said the former   our
arrangement thus made  you have nothing to fear from me  

he sat down in a chair on the hearth  over against mr  lorry  when they
were alone  mr  lorry asked him what he had done 

 not much  if it should go ill with the prisoner  i have ensured access
to him  once  

mr  lorry   countenance fell 

 it is all i could do   said carton   to propose too much  would be
to put this man   head under the axe  and  as he himself said  nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced  it was obviously the
weakness of the position  there is no help for it  

 but access to him   said mr  lorry   if it should go ill before the
tribunal  will not save him  

 i never said it would  

mr  lorry   eyes gradually sought the fire  his sympathy with his
darling  and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest  gradually
weakened them  he was an old man now  overborne with anxiety of late 
and his tears fell 

 you are a good man and a true friend   said carton  in an altered
voice   forgive me if i notice that you are affected  i could not see my
father weep  and sit by  careless  and i could not respect your
sorrow more  if you were my father  you are free from that misfortune 
however  

though he said the last words  with a slip into his usual manner  there
was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch 
that mr  lorry  who had never seen the better side of him  was wholly
unprepared for  he gave him his hand  and carton gently pressed it 

 to return to poor darnay   said carton   don   tell her of this
interview  or this arrangement  it would not enable her to go to see
him  she might think it was contrived  in case of the worse  to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence  

mr  lorry had not thought of that  and he looked quickly at carton to
see if it were in his mind  it seemed to be  he returned the look  and
evidently understood it 

 she might think a thousand things   carton said   and any of them would
only add to her trouble  don   speak of me to her  as i said to you when
i first came  i had better not see her  i can put my hand out  to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do  without that 
you are going to her  i hope  she must be very desolate to night  

 i am going now  directly  

 i am glad of that  she has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you  how does she look  

 anxious and unhappy  but very beautiful  

 ah  

it was a long  grieving sound  like a sigh  almost like a sob  it
attracted mr  lorry   eyes to carton   face  which was turned to the
fire  a light  or a shade  the old gentleman could not have said which  
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill side on a
wild bright day  and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs  which was tumbling forward  he wore the white riding coat
and top boots  then in vogue  and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale  with his long brown hair 
all untrimmed  hanging loose about him  his indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from mr  lorry 
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log  when it had
broken under the weight of his foot 

 i forgot it   he said 

mr  lorry   eyes were again attracted to his face  taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features  and having
the expression of prisoners  faces fresh in his mind  he was strongly
reminded of that expression 

 and your duties here have drawn to an end  sir   said carton  turning
to him 

 yes  as i was telling you last night when lucie came in so
unexpectedly  i have at length done all that i can do here  i hoped to
have left them in perfect safety  and then to have quitted paris  i have
my leave to pass  i was ready to go  

they were both silent 

 yours is a long life to look back upon  sir   said carton  wistfully 

 i am in my seventy eighth year  

 you have been useful all your life  steadily and constantly occupied 
trusted  respected  and looked up to  

 i have been a man of business  ever since i have been a man  indeed  i
may say that i was a man of business when a boy  

 see what a place you fill at seventy eight  how many people will miss
you when you leave it empty  

 a solitary old bachelor   answered mr  lorry  shaking his head   there
is nobody to weep for me  

 how can you say that  wouldn   she weep for you  wouldn   her child  

 yes  yes  thank god  i didn   quite mean what i said  

 it  is  a thing to thank god for  is it not  

 surely  surely  

 if you could say  with truth  to your own solitary heart  to night 
 i have secured to myself the love and attachment  the gratitude or
respect  of no human creature  i have won myself a tender place in no
regard  i have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by  
your seventy eight years would be seventy eight heavy curses  would they
not  

 you say truly  mr  carton  i think they would be  

sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire  and  after a silence of a
few moments  said 

 i should like to ask you   does your childhood seem far off  do the
days when you sat at your mother   knee  seem days of very long ago  

responding to his softened manner  mr  lorry answered 

 twenty years back  yes  at this time of my life  no  for  as i draw
closer and closer to the end  i travel in the circle  nearer and
nearer to the beginning  it seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way  my heart is touched now  by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep  of my pretty young mother  and i so old   
and by many associations of the days when what we call the world was not
so real with me  and my faults were not confirmed in me  

 i understand the feeling   exclaimed carton  with a bright flush   and
you are the better for it  

 i hope so  

carton terminated the conversation here  by rising to help him on with
his outer coat   but you   said mr  lorry  reverting to the theme   you
are young  

 yes   said carton   i am not old  but my young way was never the way to
age  enough of me  

 and of me  i am sure   said mr  lorry   are you going out  

 i ll walk with you to her gate  you know my vagabond and restless
habits  if i should prowl about the streets a long time  don   be
uneasy  i shall reappear in the morning  you go to the court to morrow  

 yes  unhappily  

 i shall be there  but only as one of the crowd  my spy will find a
place for me  take my arm  sir  

mr  lorry did so  and they went down stairs and out in the streets  a
few minutes brought them to mr  lorry   destination  carton left him
there  but lingered at a little distance  and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut  and touched it  he had heard of her going to
the prison every day   she came out here   he said  looking about him 
 turned this way  must have trod on these stones often  let me follow in
her steps  

it was ten o clock at night when he stood before the prison of la force 
where she had stood hundreds of times  a little wood sawyer  having
closed his shop  was smoking his pipe at his shop door 

 good night  citizen   said sydney carton  pausing in going by  for  the
man eyed him inquisitively 

 good night  citizen  

 how goes the republic  

 you mean the guillotine  not ill  sixty three to day  we shall mount
to a hundred soon  samson and his men complain sometimes  of being
exhausted  ha  ha  ha  he is so droll  that samson  such a barber  

 do you often go to see him   

 shave  always  every day  what a barber  you have seen him at work  

 never  

 go and see him when he has a good batch  figure this to yourself 
citizen  he shaved the sixty three to day  in less than two pipes  less
than two pipes  word of honour  

as the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking  to explain
how he timed the executioner  carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him  that he turned away 

 but you are not english   said the wood sawyer   though you wear
english dress  

 yes   said carton  pausing again  and answering over his shoulder 

 you speak like a frenchman  

 i am an old student here  

 aha  a perfect frenchman  good night  englishman  

 good night  citizen  

 but go and see that droll dog   the little man persisted  calling after
him   and take a pipe with you  

sydney had not gone far out of sight  when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp  and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper  then  traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well  several dark and dirty streets  much dirtier than usual 
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror  he stopped at a chemist   shop  which the owner was closing with
his own hands  a small  dim  crooked shop  kept in a tortuous  up hill
thoroughfare  by a small  dim  crooked man 

giving this citizen  too  good night  as he confronted him at his
counter  he laid the scrap of paper before him   whew   the chemist
whistled softly  as he read it   hi  hi  hi  

sydney carton took no heed  and the chemist said 

 for you  citizen  

 for me  

 you will be careful to keep them separate  citizen  you know the
consequences of mixing them  

 perfectly  

certain small packets were made and given to him  he put them  one by
one  in the breast of his inner coat  counted out the money for them 
and deliberately left the shop   there is nothing more to do   said he 
glancing upward at the moon   until to morrow  i can   sleep  

it was not a reckless manner  the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast sailing clouds  nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance  it was the settled manner of a tired man  who
had wandered and struggled and got lost  but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end 

long ago  when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise  he had followed his father to the grave  his
mother had died  years before  these solemn words  which had been
read at his father   grave  arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets  among the heavy shadows  with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him   i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord 
he that believeth in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me  shall never die  

in a city dominated by the axe  alone at night  with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty three who had been that day put to death 
and for to morrow   victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons 
and still of to morrow   and to morrow    the chain of association that
brought the words home  like a rusty old ship   anchor from the deep 
might have been easily found  he did not seek it  but repeated them and
went on 

with a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest  forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them  in the towers of the churches  where no prayers
were said  for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self destruction from years of priestly impostors  plunderers  and
profligates  in the distant burial places  reserved  as they wrote upon
the gates  for eternal sleep  in the abounding gaols  and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material  that no sorrowful story of a haunting spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the guillotine  with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury  sydney carton crossed the seine again for
the lighter streets 

few coaches were abroad  for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected  and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps  and put on heavy
shoes  and trudged  but  the theatres were all well filled  and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed  and went chatting home  at
one of the theatre doors  there was a little girl with a mother  looking
for a way across the street through the mud  he carried the child over 
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss 

 i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth
in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me  shall never die  

now  that the streets were quiet  and the night wore on  the words
were in the echoes of his feet  and were in the air  perfectly calm
and steady  he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked  but  he
heard them always 

the night wore out  and  as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river walls of the island of paris  where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon  the day came coldly  looking like a dead face out of the
sky  then  the night  with the moon and the stars  turned pale and died 
and for a little while it seemed as if creation were delivered over to
death   dominion 

but  the glorious sun  rising  seemed to strike those words  that burden
of the night  straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays 
and looking along them  with reverently shaded eyes  a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun  while the river
sparkled under it 

the strong tide  so swift  so deep  and certain  was like a congenial
friend  in the morning stillness  he walked by the stream  far from the
houses  and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank  when he awoke and was afoot again  he lingered there yet a little
longer  watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless  until the
stream absorbed it  and carried it on to the sea    like me  

a trading boat  with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf  then
glided into his view  floated by him  and died away  as its silent track
in the water disappeared  the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors 
ended in the words   i am the resurrection and the life  

mr  lorry was already out when he got back  and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone  sydney carton drank nothing but a
little coffee  ate some bread  and  having washed and changed to refresh
himself  went out to the place of trial 

the court was all astir and a buzz  when the black sheep  whom many fell
away from in dread  pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd 
mr  lorry was there  and doctor manette was there  she was there 
sitting beside her father 

when her husband was brought in  she turned a look upon him  so
sustaining  so encouraging  so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness  yet so courageous for his sake  that it called the healthy
blood into his face  brightened his glance  and animated his heart  if
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look  on sydney
carton  it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly 

before that unjust tribunal  there was little or no order of procedure 
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing  there could have
been no such revolution  if all laws  forms  and ceremonies  had not
first been so monstrously abused  that the suicidal vengeance of the
revolution was to scatter them all to the winds 

every eye was turned to the jury  the same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before  and to morrow and the day
after  eager and prominent among them  one man with a craving face  and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips  whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators  a life thirsting 
cannibal looking  bloody minded juryman  the jacques three of st 
antoine  the whole jury  as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer 

every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor 
no favourable leaning in that quarter to day  a fell  uncompromising 
murderous business meaning there  every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd  and gleamed at it approvingly  and heads nodded at one
another  before bending forward with a strained attention 

charles evremonde  called darnay  released yesterday  reaccused and
retaken yesterday  indictment delivered to him last night  suspected and
denounced enemy of the republic  aristocrat  one of a family of tyrants 
one of a race proscribed  for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people  charles evremonde 
called darnay  in right of such proscription  absolutely dead in law 

to this effect  in as few or fewer words  the public prosecutor 

the president asked  was the accused openly denounced or secretly 

 openly  president  

 by whom  

 three voices  ernest defarge  wine vendor of st  antoine  

 good  

 therese defarge  his wife  

 good  

 alexandre manette  physician  

a great uproar took place in the court  and in the midst of it  doctor
manette was seen  pale and trembling  standing where he had been seated 

 president  i indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud  you know the accused to be the husband of my daughter  my
daughter  and those dear to her  are far dearer to me than my life  who
and where is the false conspirator who says that i denounce the husband
of my child  

 citizen manette  be tranquil  to fail in submission to the authority of
the tribunal would be to put yourself out of law  as to what is dearer
to you than life  nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
republic  

loud acclamations hailed this rebuke  the president rang his bell  and
with warmth resumed 

 if the republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself  you would have no duty but to sacrifice her  listen to what is
to follow  in the meanwhile  be silent  

frantic acclamations were again raised  doctor manette sat down  with
his eyes looking around  and his lips trembling  his daughter drew
closer to him  the craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together 
and restored the usual hand to his mouth 

defarge was produced  when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard  and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment  and of
his having been a mere boy in the doctor   service  and of the release 
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him 
this short examination followed  for the court was quick with its work 

 you did good service at the taking of the bastille  citizen  

 i believe so  

here  an excited woman screeched from the crowd   you were one of the
best patriots there  why not say so  you were a cannonier that day
there  and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it fell  patriots  i speak the truth  

it was the vengeance who  amidst the warm commendations of the audience 
thus assisted the proceedings  the president rang his bell  but  the
vengeance  warming with encouragement  shrieked   i defy that bell  
wherein she was likewise much commended 

 inform the tribunal of what you did that day within the bastille 
citizen  

 i knew   said defarge  looking down at his wife  who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised  looking steadily up at him 
 i knew that this prisoner  of whom i speak  had been confined in a cell
known as one hundred and five  north tower  i knew it from himself  he
knew himself by no other name than one hundred and five  north tower 
when he made shoes under my care  as i serve my gun that day  i resolve 
when the place shall fall  to examine that cell  it falls  i mount to
the cell  with a fellow citizen who is one of the jury  directed by a
gaoler  i examine it  very closely  in a hole in the chimney  where a
stone has been worked out and replaced  i find a written paper  this is
that written paper  i have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of doctor manette  this is the writing of doctor manette 
i confide this paper  in the writing of doctor manette  to the hands of
the president  

 let it be read  

in a dead silence and stillness  the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife  his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father  doctor manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader  madame defarge never taking hers from the prisoner  defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife  and all the other eyes there
intent upon the doctor  who saw none of them  the paper was read  as
follows 




   the substance of the shadow


 i  alexandre manette  unfortunate physician  native of beauvais  and
afterwards resident in paris  write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the bastille  during the last month of the year  1767  i write
it at stolen intervals  under every difficulty  i design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney  where i have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it  some pitying hand may find it there  when i
and my sorrows are dust 

 these words are formed by the rusty iron point with which i write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney  mixed
with blood  in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity  hope
has quite departed from my breast  i know from terrible warnings i have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired  but i
solemnly declare that i am at this time in the possession of my right
mind  that my memory is exact and circumstantial  and that i write the
truth as i shall answer for these my last recorded words  whether they
be ever read by men or not  at the eternal judgment seat 

 one cloudy moonlight night  in the third week of december  i think the
twenty second of the month  in the year 1757  i was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the seine for the refreshment of the frosty air 
at an hour   distance from my place of residence in the street of the
school of medicine  when a carriage came along behind me  driven very
fast  as i stood aside to let that carriage pass  apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down  a head was put out at the window  and a
voice called to the driver to stop 

 the carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses 
and the same voice called to me by my name  i answered  the carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before i came up with it 

 i observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks  and appeared to
conceal themselves  as they stood side by side near the carriage door 
i also observed that they both looked of about my own age  or rather
younger  and that they were greatly alike  in stature  manner  voice 
and  as far as i could see  face too 

  you are doctor manette   said one 

 i am  

  doctor manette  formerly of beauvais   said the other   the young
physician  originally an expert surgeon  who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in paris  

  gentlemen   i returned   i am that doctor manette of whom you speak so
graciously  

  we have been to your residence   said the first   and not being
so fortunate as to find you there  and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction  we followed  in the hope of
overtaking you  will you please to enter the carriage  

 the manner of both was imperious  and they both moved  as these words
were spoken  so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door 
they were armed  i was not 

  gentlemen   said i   pardon me  but i usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance  and what is the nature of the case to
which i am summoned  

 the reply to this was made by him who had spoken second   doctor 
your clients are people of condition  as to the nature of the case 
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it  enough  will you please to
enter the carriage  

 i could do nothing but comply  and i entered it in silence  they both
entered after me  the last springing in  after putting up the steps  the
carriage turned about  and drove on at its former speed 

 i repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred  i have no doubt that
it is  word for word  the same  i describe everything exactly as it took
place  constraining my mind not to wander from the task  where i make
the broken marks that follow here  i leave off for the time  and put my
paper in its hiding place 

             

 the carriage left the streets behind  passed the north barrier  and
emerged upon the country road  at two thirds of a league from the
barrier  i did not estimate the distance at that time  but afterwards
when i traversed it  it struck out of the main avenue  and presently
stopped at a solitary house  we all three alighted  and walked  by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed  to the door of the house  it was not opened immediately  in
answer to the ringing of the bell  and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it  with his heavy riding glove  across the face 

 there was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention 
for i had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs  but  the
other of the two  being angry likewise  struck the man in like manner
with his arm  the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike  that i then first perceived them to be twin brothers 

 from the time of our alighting at the outer gate  which we found
locked  and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us  and had
relocked   i had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber  i was
conducted to this chamber straight  the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs  and i found a patient in a high fever of the brain 
lying on a bed 

 the patient was a woman of great beauty  and young  assuredly not much
past twenty  her hair was torn and ragged  and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs  i noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentleman   dress  on one of them  which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony  i saw the armorial bearings of a noble 
and the letter   

 i saw this  within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient 
for  in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed  had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth  and was
in danger of suffocation  my first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing  and in moving the scarf aside  the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight 

 i turned her gently over  placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down  and looked into her face  her eyes were dilated and
wild  and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks  and repeated the
words   my husband  my father  and my brother   and then counted up to
twelve  and said   hush   for an instant  and no more  she would pause
to listen  and then the piercing shrieks would begin again  and she
would repeat the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   and
would count up to twelve  and say   hush   there was no variation in the
order  or the manner  there was no cessation  but the regular moment  
pause  in the utterance of these sounds 

  how long   i asked   has this lasted  

 to distinguish the brothers  i will call them the elder and the
younger  by the elder  i mean him who exercised the most authority  it
was the elder who replied   since about this hour last night  

  she has a husband  a father  and a brother  

  a brother  

  i do not address her brother  

 he answered with great contempt   no  

  she has some recent association with the number twelve  

 the younger brother impatiently rejoined   with twelve o clock  

  see  gentlemen   said i  still keeping my hands upon her breast   how
useless i am  as you have brought me  if i had known what i was coming
to see  i could have come provided  as it is  time must be lost  there
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place  

 the elder brother looked to the younger  who said haughtily   there is
a case of medicines here   and brought it from a closet  and put it on
the table 

             

 i opened some of the bottles  smelt them  and put the stoppers to my
lips  if i had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves  i would not have administered any of those 

  do you doubt them   asked the younger brother 

  you see  monsieur  i am going to use them   i replied  and said no
more 

 i made the patient swallow  with great difficulty  and after many
efforts  the dose that i desired to give  as i intended to repeat it
after a while  and as it was necessary to watch its influence  i then
sat down by the side of the bed  there was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance  wife of the man down stairs   who had retreated into
a corner  the house was damp and decayed  indifferently
furnished  evidently  recently occupied and temporarily used  some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows  to deaden the
sound of the shrieks  they continued to be uttered in their regular
succession  with the cry   my husband  my father  and my brother   the
counting up to twelve  and  hush   the frenzy was so violent  that i had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms  but  i had looked to
them  to see that they were not painful  the only spark of encouragement
in the case  was  that my hand upon the sufferer   breast had this much
soothing influence  that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure  it had no effect upon the cries  no pendulum could be more
regular 

 for the reason that my hand had this effect  i assume   i had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour  with the two brothers looking on 
before the elder said 

  there is another patient  

 i was startled  and asked   is it a pressing case  

  you had better see   he carelessly answered  and took up a light 

             

 the other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase  which
was a species of loft over a stable  there was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it  the rest was open  to the ridge of the tiled roof  and
there were beams across  hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place  fagots for firing  and a heap of apples in sand  i had to
pass through that part  to get at the other  my memory is circumstantial
and unshaken  i try it with these details  and i see them all  in
this my cell in the bastille  near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity  as i saw them all that night 

 on some hay on the ground  with a cushion thrown under his head  lay a
handsome peasant boy  a boy of not more than seventeen at the most 
he lay on his back  with his teeth set  his right hand clenched on his
breast  and his glaring eyes looking straight upward  i could not see
where his wound was  as i kneeled on one knee over him  but  i could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point 

  i am a doctor  my poor fellow   said i   let me examine it  

  i do not want it examined   he answered   let it be  

 it was under his hand  and i soothed him to let me move his hand away 
the wound was a sword thrust  received from twenty to twenty four hours
before  but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay  he was then dying fast  as i turned my eyes to the elder
brother  i saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out  as if he were a wounded bird  or hare  or rabbit  not at all
as if he were a fellow creature 

  how has this been done  monsieur   said i 

  a crazed young common dog  a serf  forced my brother to draw upon him 
and has fallen by my brother   sword  like a gentleman  

 there was no touch of pity  sorrow  or kindred humanity  in this
answer  the speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there  and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind  he was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy  or about his fate 

 the boy   eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken  and they now
slowly moved to me 

  doctor  they are very proud  these nobles  but we common dogs are
proud too  sometimes  they plunder us  outrage us  beat us  kill us  but
we have a little pride left  sometimes  she  have you seen her  doctor  

 the shrieks and the cries were audible there  though subdued by the
distance  he referred to them  as if she were lying in our presence 

 i said   i have seen her  

  she is my sister  doctor  they have had their shameful rights  these
nobles  in the modesty and virtue of our sisters  many years  but we
have had good girls among us  i know it  and have heard my father say
so  she was a good girl  she was betrothed to a good young man  too  a
tenant of his  we were all tenants of his  that man   who stands there 
the other is his brother  the worst of a bad race  

 it was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak  but  his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis 

  we were so robbed by that man who stands there  as all we common dogs
are by those superior beings  taxed by him without mercy  obliged to
work for him without pay  obliged to grind our corn at his mill  obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops  and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own  pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat  we
ate it in fear  with the door barred and the shutters closed  that his
people should not see it and take it from us  i say  we were so robbed 
and hunted  and were made so poor  that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world  and that what we should
most pray for  was  that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out  

 i had never before seen the sense of being oppressed  bursting forth
like a fire  i had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere  but  i had never seen it break out  until i saw it in the
dying boy 

  nevertheless  doctor  my sister married  he was ailing at that time 
poor fellow  and she married her lover  that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage  our dog hut  as that man would call it  she had not
been married many weeks  when that man   brother saw her and admired
her  and asked that man to lend her to him  for what are husbands among
us  he was willing enough  but my sister was good and virtuous  and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine  what did the two
then  to persuade her husband to use his influence with her  to make her
willing  

 the boy   eyes  which had been fixed on mine  slowly turned to the
looker on  and i saw in the two faces that all he said was true  the two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another  i can see  even in this
bastille  the gentleman    all negligent indifference  the peasant    all
trodden down sentiment  and passionate revenge 

  you know  doctor  that it is among the rights of these nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts  and drive us  they so harnessed him and
drove him  you know that it is among their rights to keep us in their
grounds all night  quieting the frogs  in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed  they kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night  and ordered him back into his harness in the day  but he was
not persuaded  no  taken out of harness one day at noon  to feed  if he
could find food  he sobbed twelve times  once for every stroke of the
bell  and died on her bosom  

 nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong  he forced back the gathering shadows of death  as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched  and to cover his
wound 

  then  with that man   permission and even with his aid  his
brother took her away  in spite of what i know she must have told his
brother  and what that is  will not be long unknown to you  doctor  if
it is now  his brother took her away  for his pleasure and diversion 
for a little while  i saw her pass me on the road  when i took the
tidings home  our father   heart burst  he never spoke one of the words
that filled it  i took my young sister  for i have another  to a place
beyond the reach of this man  and where  at least  she will never be
 his  vassal  then  i tracked the brother here  and last night climbed
in  a common dog  but sword in hand   where is the loft window  it was
somewhere here  

 the room was darkening to his sight  the world was narrowing around
him  i glanced about me  and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor  as if there had been a struggle 

  she heard me  and ran in  i told her not to come near us till he was
dead  he came in and first tossed me some pieces of money  then struck
at me with a whip  but i  though a common dog  so struck at him as to
make him draw  let him break into as many pieces as he will  the sword
that he stained with my common blood  he drew to defend himself  thrust
at me with all his skill for his life  

 my glance had fallen  but a few moments before  on the fragments of
a broken sword  lying among the hay  that weapon was a gentleman    in
another place  lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier   

  now  lift me up  doctor  lift me up  where is he  

  he is not here   i said  supporting the boy  and thinking that he
referred to the brother 

  he  proud as these nobles are  he is afraid to see me  where is the
man who was here  turn my face to him  

 i did so  raising the boy   head against my knee  but  invested for the
moment with extraordinary power  he raised himself completely  obliging
me to rise too  or i could not have still supported him 

  marquis   said the boy  turned to him with his eyes opened wide  and
his right hand raised   in the days when all these things are to be
answered for  i summon you and yours  to the last of your bad race  to
answer for them  i mark this cross of blood upon you  as a sign that
i do it  in the days when all these things are to be answered for 
i summon your brother  the worst of the bad race  to answer for them
separately  i mark this cross of blood upon him  as a sign that i do
it  

 twice  he put his hand to the wound in his breast  and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air  he stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised  and as it dropped  he dropped with it  and i laid him
down dead 

             

 when i returned to the bedside of the young woman  i found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity  i knew that this might last
for many hours  and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave 

 i repeated the medicines i had given her  and i sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced  she never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks  never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words  they were always  my husband  my father  and my brother 
one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  ten  eleven 
twelve  hush  

 this lasted twenty six hours from the time when i first saw her  i had
come and gone twice  and was again sitting by her  when she began to
falter  i did what little could be done to assist that opportunity  and
by and bye she sank into a lethargy  and lay like the dead 

 it was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last  after a long and
fearful storm  i released her arms  and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn  it was then that i knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen  and it was then that i lost the little hope i had
had of her 

  is she dead   asked the marquis  whom i will still describe as the
elder brother  coming booted into the room from his horse 

  not dead   said i   but like to die  

  what strength there is in these common bodies   he said  looking down
at her with some curiosity 

  there is prodigious strength   i answered him   in sorrow and
despair  

 he first laughed at my words  and then frowned at them  he moved a
chair with his foot near to mine  ordered the woman away  and said in a
subdued voice 

  doctor  finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds  i
recommended that your aid should be invited  your reputation is high 
and  as a young man with your fortune to make  you are probably mindful
of your interest  the things that you see here  are things to be seen 
and not spoken of  

 i listened to the patient   breathing  and avoided answering 

  do you honour me with your attention  doctor  

  monsieur   said i   in my profession  the communications of patients
are always received in confidence   i was guarded in my answer  for i
was troubled in my mind with what i had heard and seen 

 her breathing was so difficult to trace  that i carefully tried the
pulse and the heart  there was life  and no more  looking round as i
resumed my seat  i found both the brothers intent upon me 

             

 i write with so much difficulty  the cold is so severe  i am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness  that i must abridge this narrative  there is no confusion or
failure in my memory  it can recall  and could detail  every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers 

 she lingered for a week  towards the last  i could understand some few
syllables that she said to me  by placing my ear close to her lips  she
asked me where she was  and i told her  who i was  and i told her  it
was in vain that i asked her for her family name  she faintly shook her
head upon the pillow  and kept her secret  as the boy had done 

 i had no opportunity of asking her any question  until i had told the
brothers she was sinking fast  and could not live another day  until
then  though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself  one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when i was there  but when it came to
that  they seemed careless what communication i might hold with her  as
if  the thought passed through my mind  i were dying too 

 i always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother    as i call him  having crossed swords with a peasant  and that
peasant a boy  the only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family  and was ridiculous  as often as i caught the younger
brother   eyes  their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply 
for knowing what i knew from the boy  he was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder  but i saw this  i also saw that i was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder  too 

 my patient died  two hours before midnight  at a time  by my watch 
answering almost to the minute when i had first seen her  i was alone
with her  when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side  and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended 

 the brothers were waiting in a room down stairs  impatient to ride
away  i had heard them  alone at the bedside  striking their boots with
their riding whips  and loitering up and down 

  at last she is dead   said the elder  when i went in 

  she is dead   said i 

  i congratulate you  my brother   were his words as he turned round 

 he had before offered me money  which i had postponed taking  he now
gave me a rouleau of gold  i took it from his hand  but laid it on
the table  i had considered the question  and had resolved to accept
nothing 

  pray excuse me   said i   under the circumstances  no  

 they exchanged looks  but bent their heads to me as i bent mine to
them  and we parted without another word on either side 

             

 i am weary  weary  weary  worn down by misery  i cannot read what i
have written with this gaunt hand 

 early in the morning  the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box  with my name on the outside  from the first  i had anxiously
considered what i ought to do  i decided  that day  to write privately
to the minister  stating the nature of the two cases to which i had been
summoned  and the place to which i had gone  in effect  stating all the
circumstances  i knew what court influence was  and what the immunities
of the nobles were  and i expected that the matter would never be
heard of  but  i wished to relieve my own mind  i had kept the matter a
profound secret  even from my wife  and this  too  i resolved to state
in my letter  i had no apprehension whatever of my real danger  but
i was conscious that there might be danger for others  if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that i possessed 

 i was much engaged that day  and could not complete my letter that
night  i rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it 
it was the last day of the year  the letter was lying before me just
completed  when i was told that a lady waited  who wished to see me 

             

 i am growing more and more unequal to the task i have set myself  it is
so cold  so dark  my senses are so benumbed  and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful 

 the lady was young  engaging  and handsome  but not marked for long
life  she was in great agitation  she presented herself to me as the
wife of the marquis st  evremonde  i connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother  with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf  and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that i
had seen that nobleman very lately 

 my memory is still accurate  but i cannot write the words of our
conversation  i suspect that i am watched more closely than i was  and i
know not at what times i may be watched  she had in part suspected  and
in part discovered  the main facts of the cruel story  of her husband  
share in it  and my being resorted to  she did not know that the girl
was dead  her hope had been  she said in great distress  to show her 
in secret  a woman   sympathy  her hope had been to avert the wrath of
heaven from a house that had long been hateful to the suffering many 

 she had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living  and
her greatest desire was  to help that sister  i could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister  beyond that  i knew nothing  her
inducement to come to me  relying on my confidence  had been the hope
that i could tell her the name and place of abode  whereas  to this
wretched hour i am ignorant of both 

             

 these scraps of paper fail me  one was taken from me  with a warning 
yesterday  i must finish my record to day 

 she was a good  compassionate lady  and not happy in her marriage  how
could she be  the brother distrusted and disliked her  and his influence
was all opposed to her  she stood in dread of him  and in dread of her
husband too  when i handed her down to the door  there was a child  a
pretty boy from two to three years old  in her carriage 

  for his sake  doctor   she said  pointing to him in tears   i would do
all i can to make what poor amends i can  he will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise  i have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this  it will one day be required of him  what
i have left to call my own  it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels  i will make it the first charge of his life to bestow  with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother  on this injured family  if
the sister can be discovered  

 she kissed the boy  and said  caressing him   it is for thine own dear
sake  thou wilt be faithful  little charles   the child answered her
bravely   yes   i kissed her hand  and she took him in her arms  and
went away caressing him  i never saw her more 

 as she had mentioned her husband   name in the faith that i knew it 
i added no mention of it to my letter  i sealed my letter  and  not
trusting it out of my own hands  delivered it myself that day 

 that night  the last night of the year  towards nine o clock  a man in
a black dress rang at my gate  demanded to see me  and softly followed
my servant  ernest defarge  a youth  up stairs  when my servant came
into the room where i sat with my wife  o my wife  beloved of my heart 
my fair young english wife   we saw the man  who was supposed to be at
the gate  standing silent behind him 

 an urgent case in the rue st  honore  he said  it would not detain me 
he had a coach in waiting 

 it brought me here  it brought me to my grave  when i was clear of the
house  a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind  and
my arms were pinioned  the two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner  and identified me with a single gesture  the marquis took from
his pocket the letter i had written  showed it me  burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held  and extinguished the ashes with his foot 
not a word was spoken  i was brought here  i was brought to my living
grave 

 if it had pleased  god  to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers  in all these frightful years  to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife  so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead  i might have thought that he had not quite abandoned them  but 
now i believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them  and that
they have no part in his mercies  and them and their descendants  to the
last of their race  i  alexandre manette  unhappy prisoner  do this last
night of the year 1767  in my unbearable agony  denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for  i denounce them to heaven
and to earth  

a terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done  a
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood  the narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time 
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it 

little need  in presence of that tribunal and that auditory  to show
how the defarges had not made the paper public  with the other captured
bastille memorials borne in procession  and had kept it  biding their
time  little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by saint antoine  and was wrought into the fatal register 
the man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day  against such denunciation 

and all the worse for the doomed man  that the denouncer was a
well known citizen  his own attached friend  the father of his wife  one
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was  for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity  and for sacrifices and
self immolations on the people   altar  therefore when the president
said  else had his own head quivered on his shoulders   that the good
physician of the republic would deserve better still of the republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of aristocrats  and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan  there was wild excitement  patriotic fervour  not a touch of
human sympathy 

 much influence around him  has that doctor   murmured madame defarge 
smiling to the vengeance   save him now  my doctor  save him  

at every juryman   vote  there was a roar  another and another  roar and
roar 

unanimously voted  at heart and by descent an aristocrat  an enemy
of the republic  a notorious oppressor of the people  back to the
conciergerie  and death within four and twenty hours 




xi  dusk


the wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die  fell under
the sentence  as if she had been mortally stricken  but  she uttered no
sound  and so strong was the voice within her  representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it  that it quickly raised her  even from that shock 

the judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors 
the tribunal adjourned  the quick noise and movement of the court  
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased  when lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband  with nothing in her face
but love and consolation 

 if i might touch him  if i might embrace him once  o  good citizens  if
you would have so much compassion for us  

there was but a gaoler left  along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night  and barsad  the people had all poured out to the
show in the streets  barsad proposed to the rest   let her embrace
him then  it is but a moment   it was silently acquiesced in  and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place  where he  by
leaning over the dock  could fold her in his arms 

 farewell  dear darling of my soul  my parting blessing on my love  we
shall meet again  where the weary are at rest  

they were her husband   words  as he held her to his bosom 

 i can bear it  dear charles  i am supported from above  don   suffer
for me  a parting blessing for our child  

 i send it to her by you  i kiss her by you  i say farewell to her by
you  

 my husband  no  a moment   he was tearing himself apart from her 
 we shall not be separated long  i feel that this will break my heart
by and bye  but i will do my duty while i can  and when i leave her  god
will raise up friends for her  as he did for me  

her father had followed her  and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them  but that darnay put out a hand and seized him  crying 

 no  no  what have you done  what have you done  that you should kneel
to us  we know now  what a struggle you made of old  we know  now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent  and when you knew it  we
know now  the natural antipathy you strove against  and conquered  for
her dear sake  we thank you with all our hearts  and all our love and
duty  heaven be with you  

her father   only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair 
and wring them with a shriek of anguish 

 it could not be otherwise   said the prisoner   all things have worked
together as they have fallen out  it was the always vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mother   trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you  good could never come of such evil  a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning  be comforted  and forgive me  heaven
bless you  

as he was drawn away  his wife released him  and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer  and
with a radiant look upon her face  in which there was even a comforting
smile  as he went out at the prisoners  door  she turned  laid her head
lovingly on her father   breast  tried to speak to him  and fell at his
feet 

then  issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved 
sydney carton came and took her up  only her father and mr  lorry were
with her  his arm trembled as it raised her  and supported her head 
yet  there was an air about him that was not all of pity  that had a
flush of pride in it 

 shall i take her to a coach  i shall never feel her weight  

he carried her lightly to the door  and laid her tenderly down in a
coach  her father and their old friend got into it  and he took his seat
beside the driver 

when they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before  to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden  he lifted her again  and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms  there  he laid her down on a couch  where
her child and miss pross wept over her 

 don   recall her to herself   he said  softly  to the latter   she is
better so  don   revive her to consciousness  while she only faints  

 oh  carton  carton  dear carton   cried little lucie  springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him  in a burst of grief   now that
you have come  i think you will do something to help mamma  something to
save papa  o  look at her  dear carton  can you  of all the people who
love her  bear to see her so  

he bent over the child  and laid her blooming cheek against his face  he
put her gently from him  and looked at her unconscious mother 

 before i go   he said  and paused   i may kiss her  

it was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips  he murmured some words  the child  who was nearest to
him  told them afterwards  and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady  that she heard him say   a life you love  

when he had gone out into the next room  he turned suddenly on mr  lorry
and her father  who were following  and said to the latter 

 you had great influence but yesterday  doctor manette  let it at least
be tried  these judges  and all the men in power  are very friendly to
you  and very recognisant of your services  are they not  

 nothing connected with charles was concealed from me  i had the
strongest assurances that i should save him  and i did   he returned the
answer in great trouble  and very slowly 

 try them again  the hours between this and to morrow afternoon are few
and short  but try  

 i intend to try  i will not rest a moment  

 that   well  i have known such energy as yours do great things before
now  though never   he added  with a smile and a sigh together   such
great things as this  but try  of little worth as life is when we misuse
it  it is worth that effort  it would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not  

 i will go   said doctor manette   to the prosecutor and the president
straight  and i will go to others whom it is better not to name  i will
write too  and  but stay  there is a celebration in the streets  and no
one will be accessible until dark  

 that   true  well  it is a forlorn hope at the best  and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark  i should like to know how you
speed  though  mind  i expect nothing  when are you likely to have seen
these dread powers  doctor manette  

 immediately after dark  i should hope  within an hour or two from
this  

 it will be dark soon after four  let us stretch the hour or two  if i
go to mr  lorry   at nine  shall i hear what you have done  either from
our friend or from yourself  

 yes  

 may you prosper  

mr  lorry followed sydney to the outer door  and  touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away  caused him to turn 

 i have no hope   said mr  lorry  in a low and sorrowful whisper 

 nor have i  

 if any one of these men  or all of these men  were disposed to spare
him  which is a large supposition  for what is his life  or any man  
to them   i doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court  

 and so do i  i heard the fall of the axe in that sound  

mr  lorry leaned his arm upon the door post  and bowed his face upon it 

 don   despond   said carton  very gently   don   grieve  i encouraged
doctor manette in this idea  because i felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her  otherwise  she might think  his life was wantonly
thrown away or wasted   and that might trouble her  

 yes  yes  yes   returned mr  lorry  drying his eyes   you are right 
but he will perish  there is no real hope  

 yes  he will perish  there is no real hope   echoed carton 

and walked with a settled step  down stairs 




xii  darkness


sydney carton paused in the street  not quite decided where to go   at
tellson   banking house at nine   he said  with a musing face   shall i
do well  in the mean time  to show myself  i think so  it is best that
these people should know there is such a man as i here  it is a sound
precaution  and may be a necessary preparation  but care  care  care 
let me think it out  

checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object  he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street  and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences  his first impression was
confirmed   it is best   he said  finally resolved   that these people
should know there is such a man as i here   and he turned his face
towards saint antoine 

defarge had described himself  that day  as the keeper of a wine shop in
the saint antoine suburb  it was not difficult for one who knew the city
well  to find his house without asking any question  having ascertained
its situation  carton came out of those closer streets again  and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner  for the
first time in many years  he had no strong drink  since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine  and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on mr  lorry   hearth like a man who had
done with it 

it was as late as seven o clock when he awoke refreshed  and went out
into the streets again  as he passed along towards saint antoine  he
stopped at a shop window where there was a mirror  and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat  and his coat collar  and
his wild hair  this done  he went on direct to defarge    and went in 

there happened to be no customer in the shop but jacques three  of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice  this man  whom he had seen upon
the jury  stood drinking at the little counter  in conversation with the
defarges  man and wife  the vengeance assisted in the conversation  like
a regular member of the establishment 

as carton walked in  took his seat and asked  in very indifferent
french  for a small measure of wine  madame defarge cast a careless
glance at him  and then a keener  and then a keener  and then advanced
to him herself  and asked him what it was he had ordered 

he repeated what he had already said 

 english   asked madame defarge  inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows 

after looking at her  as if the sound of even a single french word were
slow to express itself to him  he answered  in his former strong foreign
accent   yes  madame  yes  i am english  

madame defarge returned to her counter to get the wine  and  as he
took up a jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning  he heard her say   i swear to you  like evremonde  

defarge brought him the wine  and gave him good evening 

 how  

 good evening  

 oh  good evening  citizen   filling his glass   ah  and good wine  i
drink to the republic  

defarge went back to the counter  and said   certainly  a little like  
madame sternly retorted   i tell you a good deal like   jacques three
pacifically remarked   he is so much in your mind  see you  madame  
the amiable vengeance added  with a laugh   yes  my faith  and you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to morrow  

carton followed the lines and words of his paper  with a slow
forefinger  and with a studious and absorbed face  they were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together  speaking low  after a silence
of a few moments  during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the jacobin editor  they resumed
their conversation 

 it is true what madame says   observed jacques three   why stop  there
is great force in that  why stop  

 well  well   reasoned defarge   but one must stop somewhere  after all 
the question is still where  

 at extermination   said madame 

 magnificent   croaked jacques three  the vengeance  also  highly
approved 

 extermination is good doctrine  my wife   said defarge  rather
troubled   in general  i say nothing against it  but this doctor has
suffered much  you have seen him to day  you have observed his face when
the paper was read  

 i have observed his face   repeated madame  contemptuously and angrily 
 yes  i have observed his face  i have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the republic  let him take care of his face  

 and you have observed  my wife   said defarge  in a deprecatory manner 
 the anguish of his daughter  which must be a dreadful anguish to him  

 i have observed his daughter   repeated madame   yes  i have observed
his daughter  more times than one  i have observed her to day  and i
have observed her other days  i have observed her in the court  and
i have observed her in the street by the prison  let me but lift my
finger     she seemed to raise it  the listener   eyes were always on
his paper   and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her  as
if the axe had dropped 

 the citizeness is superb   croaked the juryman 

 she is an angel   said the vengeance  and embraced her 

 as to thee   pursued madame  implacably  addressing her husband   if it
depended on thee  which  happily  it does not  thou wouldst rescue this
man even now  

 no   protested defarge   not if to lift this glass would do it  but i
would leave the matter there  i say  stop there  

 see you then  jacques   said madame defarge  wrathfully   and see you 
too  my little vengeance  see you both  listen  for other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors  i have this race a long time on my register 
doomed to destruction and extermination  ask my husband  is that so  

 it is so   assented defarge  without being asked 

 in the beginning of the great days  when the bastille falls  he finds
this paper of to day  and he brings it home  and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut  we read it  here on this spot 
by the light of this lamp  ask him  is that so  

 it is so   assented defarge 

 that night  i tell him  when the paper is read through  and the lamp is
burnt out  and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars  that i have now a secret to communicate  ask him  is
that so  

 it is so   assented defarge again 

 i communicate to him that secret  i smite this bosom with these two
hands as i smite it now  and i tell him   defarge  i was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea shore  and that peasant family so injured
by the two evremonde brothers  as that bastille paper describes  is my
family  defarge  that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister  that husband was my sister   husband  that unborn child
was their child  that brother was my brother  that father was my father 
those dead are my dead  and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me   ask him  is that so  

 it is so   assented defarge once more 

 then tell wind and fire where to stop   returned madame   but don  
tell me  

both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath  the listener could feel how white she was  without seeing
her  and both highly commended it  defarge  a weak minority  interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the marquis  but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply   tell
the wind and the fire where to stop  not me  

customers entered  and the group was broken up  the english customer
paid for what he had had  perplexedly counted his change  and asked  as
a stranger  to be directed towards the national palace  madame defarge
took him to the door  and put her arm on his  in pointing out the road 
the english customer was not without his reflections then  that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm  lift it  and strike under it sharp and
deep 

but  he went his way  and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall  at the appointed hour  he emerged from it to present
himself in mr  lorry   room again  where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety  he said he had been with lucie
until just now  and had only left her for a few minutes  to come and
keep his appointment  her father had not been seen  since he quitted the
banking house towards four o clock  she had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save charles  but they were very slight  he had been
more than five hours gone  where could he be 

mr  lorry waited until ten  but  doctor manette not returning  and
he being unwilling to leave lucie any longer  it was arranged that he
should go back to her  and come to the banking house again at midnight 
in the meanwhile  carton would wait alone by the fire for the doctor 

he waited and waited  and the clock struck twelve  but doctor manette
did not come back  mr  lorry returned  and found no tidings of him  and
brought none  where could he be 

they were discussing this question  and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence  when they heard him on
the stairs  the instant he entered the room  it was plain that all was
lost 

whether he had really been to any one  or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets  was never known  as he stood staring at
them  they asked him no question  for his face told them everything 

 i cannot find it   said he   and i must have it  where is it  

his head and throat were bare  and  as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around  he took his coat off  and let it drop on the floor 

 where is my bench  i have been looking everywhere for my bench  and i
can   find it  what have they done with my work  time presses  i must
finish those shoes  

they looked at one another  and their hearts died within them 

 come  come   said he  in a whimpering miserable way   let me get to
work  give me my work  

receiving no answer  he tore his hair  and beat his feet upon the
ground  like a distracted child 

 don   torture a poor forlorn wretch   he implored them  with a dreadful
cry   but give me my work  what is to become of us  if those shoes are
not done to night  

lost  utterly lost 

it was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him  or try to restore him 
that  as if by agreement  they each put a hand upon his shoulder  and
soothed him to sit down before the fire  with a promise that he should
have his work presently  he sank into the chair  and brooded over the
embers  and shed tears  as if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy  or a dream  mr  lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that defarge had had in keeping 

affected  and impressed with terror as they both were  by this spectacle
of ruin  it was not a time to yield to such emotions  his lonely
daughter  bereft of her final hope and reliance  appealed to them both
too strongly  again  as if by agreement  they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces  carton was the first to speak 

 the last chance is gone  it was not much  yes  he had better be taken
to her  but  before you go  will you  for a moment  steadily attend to
me  don   ask me why i make the stipulations i am going to make  and
exact the promise i am going to exact  i have a reason  a good one  

 i do not doubt it   answered mr  lorry   say on  

the figure in the chair between them  was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro  and moaning  they spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick bed in the
night 

carton stooped to pick up the coat  which lay almost entangling his
feet  as he did so  a small case in which the doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day   duties  fell lightly on the floor  carton
took it up  and there was a folded paper in it   we should look
at this   he said  mr  lorry nodded his consent  he opened it  and
exclaimed   thank  god   

 what is it   asked mr  lorry  eagerly 

 a moment  let me speak of it in its place  first   he put his hand in
his coat  and took another paper from it   that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city  look at it  you see  sydney carton 
an englishman  

mr  lorry held it open in his hand  gazing in his earnest face 

 keep it for me until to morrow  i shall see him to morrow  you
remember  and i had better not take it into the prison  

 why not  

 i don   know  i prefer not to do so  now  take this paper that doctor
manette has carried about him  it is a similar certificate  enabling him
and his daughter and her child  at any time  to pass the barrier and the
frontier  you see  

 yes  

 perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil 
yesterday  when is it dated  but no matter  don   stay to look  put it
up carefully with mine and your own  now  observe  i never doubted until
within this hour or two  that he had  or could have such a paper  it is
good  until recalled  but it may be soon recalled  and  i have reason to
think  will be  

 they are not in danger  

 they are in great danger  they are in danger of denunciation by madame
defarge  i know it from her own lips  i have overheard words of that
woman    to night  which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours  i have lost no time  and since then  i have seen the spy  he
confirms me  he knows that a wood sawyer  living by the prison wall 
is under the control of the defarges  and has been rehearsed by
madame defarge as to his having seen her   he never mentioned lucie  
name   making signs and signals to prisoners  it is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one  a prison plot  and that it will
involve her life  and perhaps her child    and perhaps her father    for
both have been seen with her at that place  don   look so horrified  you
will save them all  

 heaven grant i may  carton  but how  

 i am going to tell you how  it will depend on you  and it could depend
on no better man  this new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after to morrow  probably not until two or three days afterwards 
more probably a week afterwards  you know it is a capital crime  to
mourn for  or sympathise with  a victim of the guillotine  she and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime  and this woman  the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described  would wait to add that
strength to her case  and make herself doubly sure  you follow me  

 so attentively  and with so much confidence in what you say  that for
the moment i lose sight   touching the back of the doctor   chair   even
of this distress  

 you have money  and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made  your preparations have been
completed for some days  to return to england  early to morrow have your
horses ready  so that they may be in starting trim at two o clock in the
afternoon  

 it shall be done  

his manner was so fervent and inspiring  that mr  lorry caught the
flame  and was as quick as youth 

 you are a noble heart  did i say we could depend upon no better man 
tell her  to night  what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father  dwell upon that  for she would lay her own fair head
beside her husband   cheerfully   he faltered for an instant  then went
on as before   for the sake of her child and her father  press upon her
the necessity of leaving paris  with them and you  at that hour  tell
her that it was her husband   last arrangement  tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe  or hope  you think that her
father  even in this sad state  will submit himself to her  do you not  

 i am sure of it  

 i thought so  quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here  even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage 
the moment i come to you  take me in  and drive away  

 i understand that i wait for you under all circumstances  

 you have my certificate in your hand with the rest  you know  and will
reserve my place  wait for nothing but to have my place occupied  and
then for england  

 why  then   said mr  lorry  grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand   it does not all depend on one old man  but i shall have a young
and ardent man at my side  

 by the help of heaven you shall  promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
another  

 nothing  carton  

 remember these words to morrow  change the course  or delay in it  for
any reason  and no life can possibly be saved  and many lives must
inevitably be sacrificed  

 i will remember them  i hope to do my part faithfully  

 and i hope to do mine  now  good bye  

though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness  and though he even
put the old man   hand to his lips  he did not part from him then  he
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers 
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it  and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have  he walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart  so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it  outwatched the awful night  he entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone  looking up at the light in the window of
her room  before he went away  he breathed a blessing towards it  and a
farewell 




xiii  fifty two


in the black prison of the conciergerie  the doomed of the day awaited
their fate  they were in number as the weeks of the year  fifty two were
to roll that afternoon on the life tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea  before their cells were quit of them  new occupants
were appointed  before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday 
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to morrow was already set
apart 

two score and twelve were told off  from the farmer general of seventy 
whose riches could not buy his life  to the seamstress of twenty  whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her  physical diseases  engendered
in the vices and neglects of men  will seize on victims of all degrees 
and the frightful moral disorder  born of unspeakable suffering 
intolerable oppression  and heartless indifference  smote equally
without distinction 

charles darnay  alone in a cell  had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal  in every line
of the narrative he had heard  he had heard his condemnation  he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him 
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions  and that units could
avail him nothing 

nevertheless  it was not easy  with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him  to compose his mind to what it must bear  his hold on life
was strong  and it was very  very hard  to loosen  by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here  it clenched the tighter there  and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded 
this was closed again  there was a hurry  too  in all his thoughts 
a turbulent and heated working of his heart  that contended against
resignation  if  for a moment  he did feel resigned  then his wife and
child who had to live after him  seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing 

but  all this was at first  before long  the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet  and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully  and trod it firmly every day  sprang up to stimulate
him  next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones  depended on his quiet fortitude  so 
by degrees he calmed into the better state  when he could raise his
thoughts much higher  and draw comfort down 

before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation  he had
travelled thus far on his last way  being allowed to purchase the means
of writing  and a light  he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished 

he wrote a long letter to lucie  showing her that he had known nothing
of her father   imprisonment  until he had heard of it from herself 
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father   and uncle  
responsibility for that misery  until the paper had been read  he had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished  was the one condition  fully intelligible now  that
her father had attached to their betrothal  and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage  he entreated her 
for her father   sake  never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper  or had had it recalled
to him  for the moment  or for good   by the story of the tower  on
that old sunday under the dear old plane tree in the garden  if he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it  there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the bastille  when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there  and which had been described to all the world  he
besought her  though he added that he knew it was needless  to console
her father  by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of  with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself  but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes  next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing  and her overcoming of her sorrow  to devote herself to their
dear child  he adjured her  as they would meet in heaven  to comfort her
father 

to her father himself  he wrote in the same strain  but  he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care  and
he told him this  very strongly  with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending 

to mr  lorry  he commended them all  and explained his worldly affairs 
that done  with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment  all was done  he never thought of carton  his mind was so
full of the others  that he never once thought of him 

he had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out  when
he lay down on his straw bed  he thought he had done with this world 

but  it beckoned him back in his sleep  and showed itself in shining
forms  free and happy  back in the old house in soho  though it had
nothing in it like the real house   unaccountably released and light of
heart  he was with lucie again  and she told him it was all a dream  and
he had never gone away  a pause of forgetfulness  and then he had even
suffered  and had come back to her  dead and at peace  and yet there
was no difference in him  another pause of oblivion  and he awoke in the
sombre morning  unconscious where he was or what had happened  until it
flashed upon his mind   this is the day of my death  

thus  had he come through the hours  to the day when the fifty two heads
were to fall  and now  while he was composed  and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism  a new action began in his waking
thoughts  which was very difficult to master 

he had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life  how
high it was from the ground  how many steps it had  where he would be
stood  how he would be touched  whether the touching hands would be dyed
red  which way his face would be turned  whether he would be the first 
or might be the last  these and many similar questions  in nowise
directed by his will  obtruded themselves over and over again  countless
times  neither were they connected with fear  he was conscious of no
fear  rather  they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came  a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred  a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his  than his own 

the hours went on as he walked to and fro  and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again  nine gone for ever  ten gone for
ever  eleven gone for ever  twelve coming on to pass away  after a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him  he had got the better of it  he walked up and down  softly
repeating their names to himself  the worst of the strife was over 
he could walk up and down  free from distracting fancies  praying for
himself and for them 

twelve gone for ever 

he had been apprised that the final hour was three  and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier  inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets  therefore  he resolved to keep two
before his mind  as the hour  and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able  after that time  to strengthen others 

walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast  a very
different man from the prisoner  who had walked to and fro at la force 
he heard one struck away from him  without surprise  the hour had
measured like most other hours  devoutly thankful to heaven for his
recovered self possession  he thought   there is but another now   and
turned to walk again 

footsteps in the stone passage outside the door  he stopped 

the key was put in the lock  and turned  before the door was opened  or
as it opened  a man said in a low voice  in english   he has never seen
me here  i have kept out of his way  go you in alone  i wait near  lose
no time  

the door was quickly opened and closed  and there stood before him
face to face  quiet  intent upon him  with the light of a smile on his
features  and a cautionary finger on his lip  sydney carton 

there was something so bright and remarkable in his look  that  for the
first moment  the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining  but  he spoke  and it was his voice  he took the prisoner  
hand  and it was his real grasp 

 of all the people upon earth  you least expected to see me   he said 

 i could not believe it to be you  i can scarcely believe it now  you
are not   the apprehension came suddenly into his mind   a prisoner  

 no  i am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here  and in virtue of it i stand before you  i come from her  your
wife  dear darnay  

the prisoner wrung his hand 

 i bring you a request from her  

 what is it  

 a most earnest  pressing  and emphatic entreaty  addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you  that you well
remember  

the prisoner turned his face partly aside 

 you have no time to ask me why i bring it  or what it means  i have
no time to tell you  you must comply with it  take off those boots you
wear  and draw on these of mine  

there was a chair against the wall of the cell  behind the prisoner 
carton  pressing forward  had already  with the speed of lightning  got
him down into it  and stood over him  barefoot 

 draw on these boots of mine  put your hands to them  put your will to
them  quick  

 carton  there is no escaping from this place  it never can be done  you
will only die with me  it is madness  

 it would be madness if i asked you to escape  but do i  when i ask you
to pass out at that door  tell me it is madness and remain here  change
that cravat for this of mine  that coat for this of mine  while you do
it  let me take this ribbon from your hair  and shake out your hair like
this of mine  

with wonderful quickness  and with a strength both of will and action 
that appeared quite supernatural  he forced all these changes upon him 
the prisoner was like a young child in his hands 

 carton  dear carton  it is madness  it cannot be accomplished  it never
can be done  it has been attempted  and has always failed  i implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine  

 do i ask you  my dear darnay  to pass the door  when i ask that 
refuse  there are pen and ink and paper on this table  is your hand
steady enough to write  

 it was when you came in  

 steady it again  and write what i shall dictate  quick  friend  quick  

pressing his hand to his bewildered head  darnay sat down at the table 
carton  with his right hand in his breast  stood close beside him 

 write exactly as i speak  

 to whom do i address it  

 to no one   carton still had his hand in his breast 

 do i date it  

 no  

the prisoner looked up  at each question  carton  standing over him with
his hand in his breast  looked down 

  if you remember    said carton  dictating    the words that passed
between us  long ago  you will readily comprehend this when you see it 
you do remember them  i know  it is not in your nature to forget them   

he was drawing his hand from his breast  the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder as he wrote  the hand stopped  closing upon
something 

 have you written  forget them    carton asked 

 i have  is that a weapon in your hand  

 no  i am not armed  

 what is it in your hand  

 you shall know directly  write on  there are but a few words more   he
dictated again    i am thankful that the time has come  when i can prove
them  that i do so is no subject for regret or grief    as he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer  his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer   face 

the pen dropped from darnay   fingers on the table  and he looked about
him vacantly 

 what vapour is that   he asked 

 vapour  

 something that crossed me  

 i am conscious of nothing  there can be nothing here  take up the pen
and finish  hurry  hurry  

as if his memory were impaired  or his faculties disordered  the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention  as he looked at carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing  carton  his
hand again in his breast  looked steadily at him 

 hurry  hurry  

the prisoner bent over the paper  once more 

  if it had been otherwise    carton   hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down    i never should have used the longer opportunity 
if it had been otherwise    the hand was at the prisoner   face    i
should but have had so much the more to answer for  if it had been
otherwise     carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs 

carton   hand moved back to his breast no more  the prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look  but carton   hand was close and firm at his
nostrils  and carton   left arm caught him round the waist  for a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him  but  within a minute or so  he was stretched insensible on
the ground 

quickly  but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was  carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside  combed back
his hair  and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn  then  he
softly called   enter there  come in   and the spy presented himself 

 you see   said carton  looking up  as he kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure  putting the paper in the breast   is your hazard very
great  

 mr  carton   the spy answered  with a timid snap of his fingers   my
hazard is not  that   in the thick of business here  if you are true to
the whole of your bargain  

 don   fear me  i will be true to the death  

 you must be  mr  carton  if the tale of fifty two is to be right  being
made right by you in that dress  i shall have no fear  

 have no fear  i shall soon be out of the way of harming you  and the
rest will soon be far from here  please god  now  get assistance and
take me to the coach  

 you   said the spy nervously 

 him  man  with whom i have exchanged  you go out at the gate by which
you brought me in  

 of course  

 i was weak and faint when you brought me in  and i am fainter now you
take me out  the parting interview has overpowered me  such a thing has
happened here  often  and too often  your life is in your own hands 
quick  call assistance  

 you swear not to betray me   said the trembling spy  as he paused for a
last moment 

 man  man   returned carton  stamping his foot   have i sworn by no
solemn vow already  to go through with this  that you waste the precious
moments now  take him yourself to the courtyard you know of  place
him yourself in the carriage  show him yourself to mr  lorry  tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air  and to remember my words of
last night  and his promise of last night  and drive away  

the spy withdrew  and carton seated himself at the table  resting his
forehead on his hands  the spy returned immediately  with two men 

 how  then   said one of them  contemplating the fallen figure   so
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
sainte guillotine  

 a good patriot   said the other   could hardly have been more afflicted
if the aristocrat had drawn a blank  

they raised the unconscious figure  placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door  and bent to carry it away 

 the time is short  evremonde   said the spy  in a warning voice 

 i know it well   answered carton   be careful of my friend  i entreat
you  and leave me  

 come  then  my children   said barsad   lift him  and come away  

the door closed  and carton was left alone  straining his powers of
listening to the utmost  he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm  there was none  keys turned  doors clashed 
footsteps passed along distant passages  no cry was raised  or hurry
made  that seemed unusual  breathing more freely in a little while  he
sat down at the table  and listened again until the clock struck two 

sounds that he was not afraid of  for he divined their meaning  then
began to be audible  several doors were opened in succession  and
finally his own  a gaoler  with a list in his hand  looked in  merely
saying   follow me  evremonde   and he followed into a large dark room 
at a distance  it was a dark winter day  and what with the shadows
within  and what with the shadows without  he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound  some were
standing  some seated  some were lamenting  and in restless motion 
but  these were few  the great majority were silent and still  looking
fixedly at the ground 

as he stood by the wall in a dim corner  while some of the fifty two
were brought in after him  one man stopped in passing  to embrace him 
as having a knowledge of him  it thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery  but the man went on  a very few moments after that  a young
woman  with a slight girlish form  a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour  and large widely opened patient eyes  rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting  and came to speak to him 

 citizen evremonde   she said  touching him with her cold hand   i am a
poor little seamstress  who was with you in la force  

he murmured for answer   true  i forget what you were accused of  

 plots  though the just heaven knows that i am innocent of any  is it
likely  who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me  

the forlorn smile with which she said it  so touched him  that tears
started from his eyes 

 i am not afraid to die  citizen evremonde  but i have done nothing  i
am not unwilling to die  if the republic which is to do so much good
to us poor  will profit by my death  but i do not know how that can be 
citizen evremonde  such a poor weak little creature  

as the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to  it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl 

 i heard you were released  citizen evremonde  i hoped it was true  

 it was  but  i was again taken and condemned  

 if i may ride with you  citizen evremonde  will you let me hold your
hand  i am not afraid  but i am little and weak  and it will give me
more courage  

as the patient eyes were lifted to his face  he saw a sudden doubt in
them  and then astonishment  he pressed the work worn  hunger worn young
fingers  and touched his lips 

 are you dying for him   she whispered 

 and his wife and child  hush  yes  

 o you will let me hold your brave hand  stranger  

 hush  yes  my poor sister  to the last  

             

the same shadows that are falling on the prison  are falling  in that
same hour of the early afternoon  on the barrier with the crowd about
it  when a coach going out of paris drives up to be examined 

 who goes here  whom have we within  papers  

the papers are handed out  and read 

 alexandre manette  physician  french  which is he  

this is he  this helpless  inarticulately murmuring  wandering old man
pointed out 

 apparently the citizen doctor is not in his right mind  the
revolution fever will have been too much for him  

greatly too much for him 

 hah  many suffer with it  lucie  his daughter  french  which is she  

this is she 

 apparently it must be  lucie  the wife of evremonde  is it not  

it is 

 hah  evremonde has an assignation elsewhere  lucie  her child  english 
this is she  

she and no other 

 kiss me  child of evremonde  now  thou hast kissed a good republican 
something new in thy family  remember it  sydney carton  advocate 
english  which is he  

he lies here  in this corner of the carriage  he  too  is pointed out 

 apparently the english advocate is in a swoon  

it is hoped he will recover in the fresher air  it is represented that
he is not in strong health  and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the republic 

 is that all  it is not a great deal  that  many are under the
displeasure of the republic  and must look out at the little window 
jarvis lorry  banker  english  which is he  

 i am he  necessarily  being the last  

it is jarvis lorry who has replied to all the previous questions  it
is jarvis lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door  replying to a group of officials  they leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box  to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof  the country people hanging about  press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in  a little child  carried by its
mother  has its short arm held out for it  that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the guillotine 

 behold your papers  jarvis lorry  countersigned  

 one can depart  citizen  

 one can depart  forward  my postilions  a good journey  

 i salute you  citizens   and the first danger passed  

these are again the words of jarvis lorry  as he clasps his hands  and
looks upward  there is terror in the carriage  there is weeping  there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller 

 are we not going too slowly  can they not be induced to go faster  
asks lucie  clinging to the old man 

 it would seem like flight  my darling  i must not urge them too much 
it would rouse suspicion  

 look back  look back  and see if we are pursued  

 the road is clear  my dearest  so far  we are not pursued  

houses in twos and threes pass by us  solitary farms  ruinous buildings 
dye works  tanneries  and the like  open country  avenues of leafless
trees  the hard uneven pavement is under us  the soft deep mud is on
either side  sometimes  we strike into the skirting mud  to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us  sometimes  we stick in ruts and
sloughs there  the agony of our impatience is then so great  that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running  hiding  doing
anything but stopping 

out of the open country  in again among ruinous buildings  solitary
farms  dye works  tanneries  and the like  cottages in twos and threes 
avenues of leafless trees  have these men deceived us  and taken us back
by another road  is not this the same place twice over  thank heaven 
no  a village  look back  look back  and see if we are pursued  hush 
the posting house 

leisurely  our four horses are taken out  leisurely  the coach stands in
the little street  bereft of horses  and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again  leisurely  the new horses come into visible
existence  one by one  leisurely  the new postilions follow  sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips  leisurely  the old postilions count
their money  make wrong additions  and arrive at dissatisfied results 
all the time  our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled 

at length the new postilions are in their saddles  and the old are left
behind  we are through the village  up the hill  and down the hill  and
on the low watery grounds  suddenly  the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation  and the horses are pulled up  almost on their
haunches  we are pursued 

 ho  within the carriage there  speak then  

 what is it   asks mr  lorry  looking out at window 

 how many did they say  

 i do not understand you  

   at the last post  how many to the guillotine to day  

 fifty two  

 i said so  a brave number  my fellow citizen here would have it
forty two  ten more heads are worth having  the guillotine goes
handsomely  i love it  hi forward  whoop  

the night comes on dark  he moves more  he is beginning to revive  and
to speak intelligibly  he thinks they are still together  he asks him 
by his name  what he has in his hand  o pity us  kind heaven  and help
us  look out  look out  and see if we are pursued 

the wind is rushing after us  and the clouds are flying after us  and
the moon is plunging after us  and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us  but  so far  we are pursued by nothing else 




xiv  the knitting done


in that same juncture of time when the fifty two awaited their fate
madame defarge held darkly ominous council with the vengeance and
jacques three of the revolutionary jury  not in the wine shop did madame
defarge confer with these ministers  but in the shed of the wood sawyer 
erst a mender of roads  the sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference  but abided at a little distance  like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required  or to offer an opinion until invited 

 but our defarge   said jacques three   is undoubtedly a good
republican  eh  

 there is no better   the voluble vengeance protested in her shrill
notes   in france  

 peace  little vengeance   said madame defarge  laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenant   lips   hear me speak  my husband 
fellow citizen  is a good republican and a bold man  he has deserved
well of the republic  and possesses its confidence  but my husband has
his weaknesses  and he is so weak as to relent towards this doctor  

 it is a great pity   croaked jacques three  dubiously shaking his head 
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth   it is not quite like a good
citizen  it is a thing to regret  

 see you   said madame   i care nothing for this doctor  i  he may wear
his head or lose it  for any interest i have in him  it is all one to
me  but  the evremonde people are to be exterminated  and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father  

 she has a fine head for it   croaked jacques three   i have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there  and they looked charming when samson held
them up   ogre that he was  he spoke like an epicure 

madame defarge cast down her eyes  and reflected a little 

 the child also   observed jacques three  with a meditative enjoyment
of his words   has golden hair and blue eyes  and we seldom have a child
there  it is a pretty sight  

 in a word   said madame defarge  coming out of her short abstraction 
 i cannot trust my husband in this matter  not only do i feel  since
last night  that i dare not confide to him the details of my projects 
but also i feel that if i delay  there is danger of his giving warning 
and then they might escape  

 that must never be   croaked jacques three   no one must escape  we
have not half enough as it is  we ought to have six score a day  

 in a word   madame defarge went on   my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation  and i have not his reason for
regarding this doctor with any sensibility  i must act for myself 
therefore  come hither  little citizen  

the wood sawyer  who held her in the respect  and himself in the
submission  of mortal fear  advanced with his hand to his red cap 

 touching those signals  little citizen   said madame defarge  sternly 
 that she made to the prisoners  you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day  

 ay  ay  why not   cried the sawyer   every day  in all weathers  from
two to four  always signalling  sometimes with the little one  sometimes
without  i know what i know  i have seen with my eyes  

he made all manner of gestures while he spoke  as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen 

 clearly plots   said jacques three   transparently  

 there is no doubt of the jury   inquired madame defarge  letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile 

 rely upon the patriotic jury  dear citizeness  i answer for my
fellow jurymen  

 now  let me see   said madame defarge  pondering again   yet once more 
can i spare this doctor to my husband  i have no feeling either way  can
i spare him  

 he would count as one head   observed jacques three  in a low voice 
 we really have not heads enough  it would be a pity  i think  

 he was signalling with her when i saw her   argued madame defarge   i
cannot speak of one without the other  and i must not be silent  and
trust the case wholly to him  this little citizen here  for  i am not a
bad witness  

the vengeance and jacques three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses  the little citizen  not to be outdone  declared her to be a
celestial witness 

 he must take his chance   said madame defarge   no  i cannot spare
him  you are engaged at three o clock  you are going to see the batch of
to day executed   you  

the question was addressed to the wood sawyer  who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative  seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of republicans  and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
republicans  if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber  he was so very demonstrative herein  that he might have been
suspected  perhaps was  by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of madame defarge   head  of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety  every hour in the day 

 i   said madame   am equally engaged at the same place  after it is
over  say at eight to night  come you to me  in saint antoine  and we
will give information against these people at my section  

the wood sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness  the citizeness looking at him  he became embarrassed  evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done  retreated among his wood  and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw 

madame defarge beckoned the juryman and the vengeance a little nearer to
the door  and there expounded her further views to them thus 

 she will now be at home  awaiting the moment of his death  she will
be mourning and grieving  she will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the republic  she will be full of sympathy with its enemies 
i will go to her  

 what an admirable woman  what an adorable woman   exclaimed jacques
three  rapturously   ah  my cherished   cried the vengeance  and
embraced her 

 take you my knitting   said madame defarge  placing it in her
lieutenant   hands   and have it ready for me in my usual seat  keep
me my usual chair  go you there  straight  for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual  to day  

 i willingly obey the orders of my chief   said the vengeance with
alacrity  and kissing her cheek   you will not be late  

 i shall be there before the commencement  

 and before the tumbrils arrive  be sure you are there  my soul   said
the vengeance  calling after her  for she had already turned into the
street   before the tumbrils arrive  

madame defarge slightly waved her hand  to imply that she heard  and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time  and so went through the
mud  and round the corner of the prison wall  the vengeance and the
juryman  looking after her as she walked away  were highly appreciative
of her fine figure  and her superb moral endowments 

there were many women at that time  upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand  but  there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman  now taking her way along the streets  of a
strong and fearless character  of shrewd sense and readiness  of great
determination  of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity  but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities  the troubled time would have
heaved her up  under any circumstances  but  imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong  and an inveterate hatred of a class 
opportunity had developed her into a tigress  she was absolutely without
pity  if she had ever had the virtue in her  it had quite gone out of
her 

it was nothing to her  that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers  she saw  not him  but them  it was nothing to her  that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan  that was
insufficient punishment  because they were her natural enemies and
her prey  and as such had no right to live  to appeal to her  was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity  even for herself  if she had
been laid low in the streets  in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged  she would not have pitied herself  nor  if she had
been ordered to the axe to morrow  would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there 

such a heart madame defarge carried under her rough robe  carelessly
worn  it was a becoming robe enough  in a certain weird way  and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap  lying hidden in her
bosom  was a loaded pistol  lying hidden at her waist  was a sharpened
dagger  thus accoutred  and walking with the confident tread of such
a character  and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood  bare foot and bare legged  on the brown
sea sand  madame defarge took her way along the streets 

now  when the journey of the travelling coach  at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load  had been planned out last night 
the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr  lorry  
attention  it was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach 
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers  should be reduced to the utmost  since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there 
finally  he had proposed  after anxious consideration  that miss pross
and jerry  who were at liberty to leave the city  should leave it at
three o clock in the lightest wheeled conveyance known to that period 
unencumbered with luggage  they would soon overtake the coach  and 
passing it and preceding it on the road  would order its horses in
advance  and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night  when delay was the most to be dreaded 

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency  miss pross hailed it with joy  she and jerry had
beheld the coach start  had known who it was that solomon brought  had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense  and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach  even as madame defarge 
taking her way through the streets  now drew nearer and nearer to the
else deserted lodging in which they held their consultation 

 now what do you think  mr  cruncher   said miss pross  whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak  or stand  or move  or live 
 what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard  another
carriage having already gone from here to day  it might awaken
suspicion  

 my opinion  miss   returned mr  cruncher   is as you re right  likewise
wot i ll stand by you  right or wrong  

 i am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures   said
miss pross  wildly crying   that i am incapable of forming any plan  are
 you  capable of forming any plan  my dear good mr  cruncher  

 respectin  a future spear o  life  miss   returned mr  cruncher   i
hope so  respectin  any present use o  this here blessed old head o 
mine  i think not  would you do me the favour  miss  to take notice o 
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis  

 oh  for gracious sake   cried miss pross  still wildly crying   record
them at once  and get them out of the way  like an excellent man  

 first   said mr  cruncher  who was all in a tremble  and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage   them poor things well out o  this  never no
more will i do it  never no more  

 i am quite sure  mr  cruncher   returned miss pross   that you
never will do it again  whatever it is  and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is  

 no  miss   returned jerry   it shall not be named to you  second  them
poor things well out o  this  and never no more will i interfere with
mrs  cruncher   flopping  never no more  

 whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be   said miss pross 
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself   i have no doubt it
is best that mrs  cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence   o my poor darlings  

 i go so far as to say  miss  moreover   proceeded mr  cruncher  with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit   and let my words
be took down and took to mrs  cruncher through yourself  that wot my
opinions respectin  flopping has undergone a change  and that wot i only
hope with all my heart as mrs  cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time  

 there  there  there  i hope she is  my dear man   cried the distracted
miss pross   and i hope she finds it answering her expectations  

 forbid it   proceeded mr  cruncher  with additional solemnity 
additional slowness  and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out   as anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now  forbid it as we shouldn   all
flop  if it was anyways conwenient  to get  em out o  this here dismal
risk  forbid it  miss  wot i say  for  bid  it   this was mr  cruncher  
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one 

and still madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came
nearer and nearer 

 if we ever get back to our native land   said miss pross   you may rely
upon my telling mrs  cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said  and at all events
you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time  now  pray let us think  my esteemed mr 
cruncher  let us think  

still  madame defarge  pursuing her way along the streets  came nearer
and nearer 

 if you were to go before   said miss pross   and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here  and were to wait somewhere for me  wouldn  
that be best  

mr  cruncher thought it might be best 

 where could you wait for me   asked miss pross 

mr  cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar  alas  temple bar was hundreds of miles away  and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed 

 by the cathedral door   said miss pross   would it be much out of
the way  to take me in  near the great cathedral door between the two
towers  

 no  miss   answered mr  cruncher 

 then  like the best of men   said miss pross   go to the posting house
straight  and make that change  

 i am doubtful   said mr  cruncher  hesitating and shaking his head 
 about leaving of you  you see  we don   know what may happen  

 heaven knows we don     returned miss pross   but have no fear for me 
take me in at the cathedral  at three o clock  or as near it as you can 
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here  i feel certain
of it  there  bless you  mr  cruncher  think not of me  but of the lives
that may depend on both of us  

this exordium  and miss pross   two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his  decided mr  cruncher  with an encouraging nod or two  he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements  and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed 

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution  was a great relief to miss pross  the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets  was another relief  she looked at her watch  and it was twenty
minutes past two  she had no time to lose  but must get ready at once 

afraid  in her extreme perturbation  of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms  and of half imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them  miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes 
which were swollen and red  haunted by her feverish apprehensions  she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water  but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her  in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out  for she saw a figure standing in the room 

the basin fell to the ground broken  and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge  by strange stern ways  and through much staining blood 
those feet had come to meet that water 

madame defarge looked coldly at her  and said   the wife of evremonde 
where is she  

it flashed upon miss pross   mind that the doors were all standing open 
and would suggest the flight  her first act was to shut them  there were
four in the room  and she shut them all  she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied 

madame defarge   dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement 
and rested on her when it was finished  miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her  years had not tamed the wildness  or softened the grimness 
of her appearance  but  she too was a determined woman in her different
way  and she measured madame defarge with her eyes  every inch 

 you might  from your appearance  be the wife of lucifer   said miss
pross  in her breathing   nevertheless  you shall not get the better of
me  i am an englishwoman  

madame defarge looked at her scornfully  but still with something of
miss pross   own perception that they two were at bay  she saw a tight 
hard  wiry woman before her  as mr  lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand  in the years gone by  she knew full well that
miss pross was the family   devoted friend  miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the family   malevolent enemy 

 on my way yonder   said madame defarge  with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot   where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me  i am come to make my compliments to her in passing  i
wish to see her  

 i know that your intentions are evil   said miss pross   and you may
depend upon it  i ll hold my own against them  

each spoke in her own language  neither understood the other   words 
both were very watchful  and intent to deduce from look and manner  what
the unintelligible words meant 

 it will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment   said madame defarge   good patriots will know what that means 
let me see her  go tell her that i wish to see her  do you hear  

 if those eyes of yours were bed winches   returned miss pross   and i
was an english four poster  they shouldn   loose a splinter of me  no 
you wicked foreign woman  i am your match  

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail  but  she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught 

 woman imbecile and pig like   said madame defarge  frowning   i take no
answer from you  i demand to see her  either tell her that i demand
to see her  or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her  
this  with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm 

 i little thought   said miss pross   that i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language  but i would give all i have 
except the clothes i wear  to know whether you suspect the truth  or any
part of it  

neither of them for a single moment released the other   eyes  madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her  but  she now advanced one step 

 i am a briton   said miss pross   i am desperate  i don   care an
english twopence for myself  i know that the longer i keep you here  the
greater hope there is for my ladybird  i ll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head  if you lay a finger on me  

thus miss pross  with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence  and every rapid sentence a whole breath 
thus miss pross  who had never struck a blow in her life 

but  her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes  this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness   ha  ha   she
laughed   you poor wretch  what are you worth  i address myself to that
doctor   then she raised her voice and called out   citizen doctor  wife
of evremonde  child of evremonde  any person but this miserable fool 
answer the citizeness defarge  

perhaps the following silence  perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss pross   face  perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion  whispered to madame defarge that they were gone 
three of the doors she opened swiftly  and looked in 

 those rooms are all in disorder  there has been hurried packing  there
are odds and ends upon the ground  there is no one in that room behind
you  let me look  

 never   said miss pross  who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer 

 if they are not in that room  they are gone  and can be pursued and
brought back   said madame defarge to herself 

 as long as you don   know whether they are in that room or not  you are
uncertain what to do   said miss pross to herself   and you shall not
know that  if i can prevent your knowing it  and know that  or not know
that  you shall not leave here while i can hold you  

 i have been in the streets from the first  nothing has stopped me 
i will tear you to pieces  but i will have you from that door   said
madame defarge 

 we are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard  we are
not likely to be heard  and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here 
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling   said miss pross 

madame defarge made at the door  miss pross  on the instinct of the
moment  seized her round the waist in both her arms  and held her tight 
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike  miss pross 
with the vigorous tenacity of love  always so much stronger than hate 
clasped her tight  and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had  the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face  but  miss pross  with her head down  held her round the waist  and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman 

soon  madame defarge   hands ceased to strike  and felt at her encircled
waist   it is under my arm   said miss pross  in smothered tones   you
shall not draw it  i am stronger than you  i bless heaven for it  i hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies  

madame defarge   hands were at her bosom  miss pross looked up  saw
what it was  struck at it  struck out a flash and a crash  and stood
alone  blinded with smoke 

all this was in a second  as the smoke cleared  leaving an awful
stillness  it passed out on the air  like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground 

in the first fright and horror of her situation  miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could  and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help  happily  she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did  in time to check herself and go back  it was dreadful to
go in at the door again  but  she did go in  and even went near it  to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear  these she put on 
out on the staircase  first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key  she then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry  and then got up and hurried away 

by good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet  or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped  by good fortune  too  she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman  she needed both advantages  for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face  and her hair was torn  and her
dress  hastily composed with unsteady hands  was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways 

in crossing the bridge  she dropped the door key in the river  arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort  and waiting there 
she thought  what if the key were already taken in a net  what if
it were identified  what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered  what if she were stopped at the gate  sent to prison  and
charged with murder  in the midst of these fluttering thoughts  the
escort appeared  took her in  and took her away 

 is there any noise in the streets   she asked him 

 the usual noises   mr  cruncher replied  and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect 

 i don   hear you   said miss pross   what do you say  

it was in vain for mr  cruncher to repeat what he said  miss pross could
not hear him   so i ll nod my head   thought mr  cruncher  amazed   at
all events she ll see that   and she did 

 is there any noise in the streets now   asked miss pross again 
presently 

again mr  cruncher nodded his head 

 i don   hear it  

 gone deaf in an hour   said mr  cruncher  ruminating  with his mind
much disturbed   wot   come to her  

 i feel   said miss pross   as if there had been a flash and a crash 
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life  

 blest if she ain   in a queer condition   said mr  cruncher  more and
more disturbed   wot can she have been a takin   to keep her courage up 
hark  there   the roll of them dreadful carts  you can hear that  miss  

 i can hear   said miss pross  seeing that he spoke to her   nothing  o 
my good man  there was first a great crash  and then a great stillness 
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable  never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts  

 if she don   hear the roll of those dreadful carts  now very nigh their
journey   end   said mr  cruncher  glancing over his shoulder   it   my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world  

and indeed she never did 




xv  the footsteps die out for ever


along the paris streets  the death carts rumble  hollow and harsh  six
tumbrils carry the day   wine to la guillotine  all the devouring and
insatiate monsters imagined since imagination could record itself 
are fused in the one realisation  guillotine  and yet there is not in
france  with its rich variety of soil and climate  a blade  a leaf 
a root  a sprig  a peppercorn  which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror  crush
humanity out of shape once more  under similar hammers  and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms  sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again  and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind 

six tumbrils roll along the streets  change these back again to what
they were  thou powerful enchanter  time  and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs  the equipages of feudal nobles  the
toilettes of flaring jezebels  the churches that are not my father  
house but dens of thieves  the huts of millions of starving peasants 
no  the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the creator  never reverses his transformations   if thou be changed
into this shape by the will of god   say the seers to the enchanted  in
the wise arabian stories   then remain so  but  if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration  then resume thy former aspect  
changeless and hopeless  the tumbrils roll along 

as the sombre wheels of the six carts go round  they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets  ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that  and the ploughs go steadily onward 
so used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle  that
in many windows there are no people  and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended  while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils  here and there  the inmate has visitors to see the sight 
then he points his finger  with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent  to this cart and to this  and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday  and who there the day before 

of the riders in the tumbrils  some observe these things  and all
things on their last roadside  with an impassive stare  others  with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men  some  seated with
drooping heads  are sunk in silent despair  again  there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres  and in pictures  several close their eyes 
and think  or try to get their straying thoughts together  only one  and
he a miserable creature  of a crazed aspect  is so shattered and made
drunk by horror  that he sings  and tries to dance  not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture  to the pity of the people 

there is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils 
and faces are often turned up to some of them  and they are asked some
question  it would seem to be always the same question  for  it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart  the
horsemen abreast of that cart  frequently point out one man in it with
their swords  the leading curiosity is  to know which is he  he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down  to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart  and holds his hand  he has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him  and always speaks to the
girl  here and there in the long street of st  honore  cries are raised
against him  if they move him at all  it is only to a quiet smile  as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face  he cannot easily
touch his face  his arms being bound 

on the steps of a church  awaiting the coming up of the tumbrils  stands
the spy and prison sheep  he looks into the first of them  not there 
he looks into the second  not there  he already asks himself   has he
sacrificed me   when his face clears  as he looks into the third 

 which is evremonde   says a man behind him 

 that  at the back there  

 with his hand in the girl    

 yes  

the man cries   down  evremonde  to the guillotine all aristocrats 
down  evremonde  

 hush  hush   the spy entreats him  timidly 

 and why not  citizen  

 he is going to pay the forfeit  it will be paid in five minutes more 
let him be at peace  

but the man continuing to exclaim   down  evremonde   the face of
evremonde is for a moment turned towards him  evremonde then sees the
spy  and looks attentively at him  and goes his way 

the clocks are on the stroke of three  and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round  to come on into the place of execution  and
end  the ridges thrown to this side and to that  now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on  for all are following
to the guillotine  in front of it  seated in chairs  as in a garden of
public diversion  are a number of women  busily knitting  on one of the
fore most chairs  stands the vengeance  looking about for her friend 

 therese   she cries  in her shrill tones   who has seen her  therese
defarge  

 she never missed before   says a knitting woman of the sisterhood 

 no  nor will she miss now   cries the vengeance  petulantly   therese  

 louder   the woman recommends 

ay  louder  vengeance  much louder  and still she will scarcely hear
thee  louder yet  vengeance  with a little oath or so added  and yet
it will hardly bring her  send other women up and down to seek her 
lingering somewhere  and yet  although the messengers have done dread
deeds  it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her 

 bad fortune   cries the vengeance  stamping her foot in the chair   and
here are the tumbrils  and evremonde will be despatched in a wink  and
she not here  see her knitting in my hand  and her empty chair ready for
her  i cry with vexation and disappointment  

as the vengeance descends from her elevation to do it  the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads  the ministers of sainte guillotine are
robed and ready  crash   a head is held up  and the knitting women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak  count one 

the second tumbril empties and moves on  the third comes up  crash   and
the knitting women  never faltering or pausing in their work  count two 

the supposed evremonde descends  and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him  he has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out  but
still holds it as he promised  he gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls  and she looks into
his face and thanks him 

 but for you  dear stranger  i should not be so composed  for i am
naturally a poor little thing  faint of heart  nor should i have been
able to raise my thoughts to him who was put to death  that we might
have hope and comfort here to day  i think you were sent to me by
heaven  

 or you to me   says sydney carton   keep your eyes upon me  dear child 
and mind no other object  

 i mind nothing while i hold your hand  i shall mind nothing when i let
it go  if they are rapid  

 they will be rapid  fear not  

the two stand in the fast thinning throng of victims  but they speak as
if they were alone  eye to eye  voice to voice  hand to hand  heart to
heart  these two children of the universal mother  else so wide apart
and differing  have come together on the dark highway  to repair home
together  and to rest in her bosom 

 brave and generous friend  will you let me ask you one last question  i
am very ignorant  and it troubles me  just a little  

 tell me what it is  

 i have a cousin  an only relative and an orphan  like myself  whom i
love very dearly  she is five years younger than i  and she lives in a
farmer   house in the south country  poverty parted us  and she knows
nothing of my fate  for i cannot write  and if i could  how should i
tell her  it is better as it is  

 yes  yes  better as it is  

 what i have been thinking as we came along  and what i am still
thinking now  as i look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support  is this   if the republic really does good to the poor 
and they come to be less hungry  and in all ways to suffer less  she may
live a long time  she may even live to be old  

 what then  my gentle sister  

 do you think   the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance  fill with tears  and the lips part a little more and tremble 
 that it will seem long to me  while i wait for her in the better land
where i trust both you and i will be mercifully sheltered  

 it cannot be  my child  there is no time there  and no trouble there  

 you comfort me so much  i am so ignorant  am i to kiss you now  is the
moment come  

 yes  

she kisses his lips  he kisses hers  they solemnly bless each other 
the spare hand does not tremble as he releases it  nothing worse than
a sweet  bright constancy is in the patient face  she goes next before
him  is gone  the knitting women count twenty two 

 i am the resurrection and the life  saith the lord  he that believeth
in me  though he were dead  yet shall he live  and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die  

the murmuring of many voices  the upturning of many faces  the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd  so that it swells
forward in a mass  like one great heave of water  all flashes away 
twenty three 

             

they said of him  about the city that night  that it was the
peacefullest man   face ever beheld there  many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic 

one of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe  a woman  had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold  not long before  to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her  if he had given any
utterance to his  and they were prophetic  they would have been these 

 i see barsad  and cly  defarge  the vengeance  the juryman  the judge 
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old  perishing by this retributive instrument  before it shall cease
out of its present use  i see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss  and  in their struggles to be truly free  in
their triumphs and defeats  through long years to come  i see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth  gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out 

 i see the lives for which i lay down my life  peaceful  useful 
prosperous and happy  in that england which i shall see no more  i see
her with a child upon her bosom  who bears my name  i see her father 
aged and bent  but otherwise restored  and faithful to all men in his
healing office  and at peace  i see the good old man  so long their
friend  in ten years  time enriching them with all he has  and passing
tranquilly to his reward 

 i see that i hold a sanctuary in their hearts  and in the hearts of
their descendants  generations hence  i see her  an old woman  weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day  i see her and her husband  their
course done  lying side by side in their last earthly bed  and i know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other   soul 
than i was in the souls of both 

 i see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name  a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine  i see him
winning it so well  that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his  i see the blots i threw upon it  faded away  i see him 
fore most of just judges and honoured men  bringing a boy of my name 
with a forehead that i know and golden hair  to this place  then fair to
look upon  with not a trace of this day   disfigurement  and i hear him
tell the child my story  with a tender and a faltering voice 

 it is a far  far better thing that i do  than i have ever done  it is a
far  far better rest that i go to than i have ever known

a ghost story of christmas

preface

i have endeavoured in this ghostly little book 
to raise the ghost of an idea  which shall not put my
readers out of humour with themselves  with each other 
with the season  or with me   may it haunt their houses
pleasantly  and no one wish to lay it 

their faithful friend and servant

stave i   marley   ghost

marley was dead  to begin with  there is no doubt
whatever about that  the register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman  the clerk  the undertaker 
and the chief mourner  scrooge signed it  and
scrooge   name was good upon  change  for anything he
chose to put his hand to  old marley was as dead as a
door nail 

mind  i don   mean to say that i know  of my
own knowledge  what there is particularly dead about
a door nail  i might have been inclined  myself  to
regard a coffin nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade  but the wisdom of our ancestors
is in the simile  and my unhallowed hands
shall not disturb it  or the country   done for  you
will therefore permit me to repeat  emphatically  that
marley was as dead as a door nail 

scrooge knew he was dead  of course he did 
how could it be otherwise  scrooge and he were
partners for i don   know how many years  scrooge
was his sole executor  his sole administrator  his sole
assign  his sole residuary legatee  his sole friend  and
sole mourner  and even scrooge was not so dreadfully
cut up by the sad event  but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of the funeral 
and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain 

the mention of marley   funeral brings me back to
the point i started from  there is no doubt that marley
was dead  this must be distinctly understood  or
nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going
to relate  if we were not perfectly convinced that
hamlet   father died before the play began  there
would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a
stroll at night  in an easterly wind  upon his own ramparts 
than there would be in any other middle aged
gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
spot  say saint paul   churchyard for instance  
literally to astonish his son   weak mind 

scrooge never painted out old marley   name 
there it stood  years afterwards  above the warehouse
door  scrooge and marley  the firm was known as
scrooge and marley  sometimes people new to the
business called scrooge scrooge  and sometimes marley 
but he answered to both names  it was all the
same to him 

oh  but he was a tight fisted hand at the grind stone 
scrooge  a squeezing  wrenching  grasping  scraping 
clutching  covetous  old sinner  hard and sharp as flint 
from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire 
secret  and self contained  and solitary as an oyster  the
cold within him froze his old features  nipped his pointed
nose  shrivelled his cheek  stiffened his gait  made his
eyes red  his thin lips blue  and spoke out shrewdly in his
grating voice  a frosty rime was on his head  and on his
eyebrows  and his wiry chin  he carried his own low
temperature always about with him  he iced his office in
the dog days  and didn   thaw it one degree at christmas 

external heat and cold had little influence on
scrooge  no warmth could warm  no wintry weather
chill him  no wind that blew was bitterer than he 
no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose  no
pelting rain less open to entreaty  foul weather didn  
know where to have him  the heaviest rain  and
snow  and hail  and sleet  could boast of the advantage
over him in only one respect  they often  came down 
handsomely  and scrooge never did 

nobody ever stopped him in the street to say  with
gladsome looks   my dear scrooge  how are you 
when will you come to see me   no beggars implored
him to bestow a trifle  no children asked him
what it was o clock  no man or woman ever once in all
his life inquired the way to such and such a place  of
scrooge  even the blind men   dogs appeared to
know him  and when they saw him coming on  would
tug their owners into doorways and up courts  and
then would wag their tails as though they said   no
eye at all is better than an evil eye  dark master  

but what did scrooge care  it was the very thing
he liked  to edge his way along the crowded paths
of life  warning all human sympathy to keep its distance 
was what the knowing ones call  nuts  to scrooge 

once upon a time  of all the good days in the year 
on christmas eve  old scrooge sat busy in his
counting house  it was cold  bleak  biting weather  foggy
withal  and he could hear the people in the court outside 
go wheezing up and down  beating their hands
upon their breasts  and stamping their feet upon the
pavement stones to warm them  the city clocks had
only just gone three  but it was quite dark already  
it had not been light all day  and candles were flaring
in the windows of the neighbouring offices  like
ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air  the fog
came pouring in at every chink and keyhole  and was
so dense without  that although the court was of the
narrowest  the houses opposite were mere phantoms 
to see the dingy cloud come drooping down  obscuring
everything  one might have thought that nature
lived hard by  and was brewing on a large scale 

the door of scrooge   counting house was open
that he might keep his eye upon his clerk  who in a
dismal little cell beyond  a sort of tank  was copying
letters  scrooge had a very small fire  but the clerk  
fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal  but he couldn   replenish it  for scrooge kept
the coal box in his own room  and so surely as the
clerk came in with the shovel  the master predicted
that it would be necessary for them to part  wherefore
the clerk put on his white comforter  and tried to
warm himself at the candle  in which effort  not being
a man of a strong imagination  he failed 

 a merry christmas  uncle  god save you   cried
a cheerful voice  it was the voice of scrooge  
nephew  who came upon him so quickly that this was
the first intimation he had of his approach 

 bah   said scrooge   humbug  

he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
fog and frost  this nephew of scrooge    that he was
all in a glow  his face was ruddy and handsome  his
eyes sparkled  and his breath smoked again 

 christmas a humbug  uncle   said scrooge  
nephew   you don   mean that  i am sure  

 i do   said scrooge   merry christmas  what
right have you to be merry  what reason have you
to be merry  you re poor enough  

 come  then   returned the nephew gaily   what
right have you to be dismal  what reason have you
to be morose  you re rich enough  

scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur
of the moment  said   bah   again  and followed it up
with  humbug  

 don   be cross  uncle   said the nephew 

 what else can i be   returned the uncle   when i
live in such a world of fools as this  merry christmas 
out upon merry christmas  what   christmas
time to you but a time for paying bills without
money  a time for finding yourself a year older  but
not an hour richer  a time for balancing your books
and having every item in  em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you  if i could
work my will   said scrooge indignantly   every idiot
who goes about with  merry christmas  on his lips 
should be boiled with his own pudding  and buried
with a stake of holly through his heart  he should  

 uncle   pleaded the nephew 

 nephew   returned the uncle sternly   keep christmas
in your own way  and let me keep it in mine  

 keep it   repeated scrooge   nephew   but you
don   keep it  

 let me leave it alone  then   said scrooge   much
good may it do you  much good it has ever done
you  

 there are many things from which i might have
derived good  by which i have not profited  i dare
say   returned the nephew   christmas among the
rest  but i am sure i have always thought of christmas
time  when it has come round  apart from the
veneration due to its sacred name and origin  if anything
belonging to it can be apart from that  as a
good time  a kind  forgiving  charitable  pleasant
time  the only time i know of  in the long calendar
of the year  when men and women seem by one consent
to open their shut up hearts freely  and to think
of people below them as if they really were
fellow passengers to the grave  and not another race
of creatures bound on other journeys  and therefore 
uncle  though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket  i believe that it has done me
good  and will do me good  and i say  god bless it  

the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded 
becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety 
he poked the fire  and extinguished the last frail spark
for ever 

 let me hear another sound from you   said
scrooge   and you ll keep your christmas by losing
your situation  you re quite a powerful speaker 
sir   he added  turning to his nephew   i wonder you
don   go into parliament  

 don   be angry  uncle  come  dine with us to morrow  

scrooge said that he would see him  yes  indeed he
did  he went the whole length of the expression 
and said that he would see him in that extremity first 

 but why   cried scrooge   nephew   why  

 why did you get married   said scrooge 

 because i fell in love  

 because you fell in love   growled scrooge  as if
that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous
than a merry christmas   good afternoon  

 nay  uncle  but you never came to see me before
that happened  why give it as a reason for not
coming now  

 good afternoon   said scrooge 

 i want nothing from you  i ask nothing of you 
why cannot we be friends  

 good afternoon   said scrooge 

 i am sorry  with all my heart  to find you so
resolute  we have never had any quarrel  to which i
have been a party  but i have made the trial in
homage to christmas  and i ll keep my christmas
humour to the last  so a merry christmas  uncle  

 good afternoon   said scrooge 

 and a happy new year  

 good afternoon   said scrooge 

his nephew left the room without an angry word 
notwithstanding  he stopped at the outer door to
bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk  who 
cold as he was  was warmer than scrooge  for he returned
them cordially 

 there   another fellow   muttered scrooge  who
overheard him   my clerk  with fifteen shillings a
week  and a wife and family  talking about a merry
christmas  i ll retire to bedlam  

this lunatic  in letting scrooge   nephew out  had
let two other people in  they were portly gentlemen 
pleasant to behold  and now stood  with their hats off 
in scrooge   office  they had books and papers in
their hands  and bowed to him 

 scrooge and marley    i believe   said one of the
gentlemen  referring to his list   have i the pleasure
of addressing mr  scrooge  or mr  marley  

 mr  marley has been dead these seven years  
scrooge replied   he died seven years ago  this very
night  

 we have no doubt his liberality is well represented
by his surviving partner   said the gentleman  presenting
his credentials 

it certainly was  for they had been two kindred
spirits  at the ominous word  liberality   scrooge
frowned  and shook his head  and handed the credentials
back 

 at this festive season of the year  mr  scrooge  
said the gentleman  taking up a pen   it is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the poor and destitute  who suffer
greatly at the present time  many thousands are in
want of common necessaries  hundreds of thousands
are in want of common comforts  sir  

 are there no prisons   asked scrooge 

 plenty of prisons   said the gentleman  laying down
the pen again 

 and the union workhouses   demanded scrooge 
 are they still in operation  

 they are  still   returned the gentleman   i wish
i could say they were not  

 the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour 
then   said scrooge 

 both very busy  sir  

 oh  i was afraid  from what you said at first 
that something had occurred to stop them in their
useful course   said scrooge   i   very glad to
hear it  

 under the impression that they scarcely furnish
christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude  
returned the gentleman   a few of us are endeavouring
to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink 
and means of warmth  we choose this time  because
it is a time  of all others  when want is keenly felt 
and abundance rejoices  what shall i put you down
for  

 nothing   scrooge replied 

 you wish to be anonymous  

 i wish to be left alone   said scrooge   since you
ask me what i wish  gentlemen  that is my answer 
i don   make merry myself at christmas and i can  
afford to make idle people merry  i help to support
the establishments i have mentioned  they cost
enough  and those who are badly off must go there  

 many can   go there  and many would rather die  

 if they would rather die   said scrooge   they had
better do it  and decrease the surplus population 
besides  excuse me  i don   know that  

 but you might know it   observed the gentleman 

 it   not my business   scrooge returned   it  
enough for a man to understand his own business  and
not to interfere with other people    mine occupies
me constantly  good afternoon  gentlemen  

seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue
their point  the gentlemen withdrew  scrooge resumed
his labours with an improved opinion of himself 
and in a more facetious temper than was usual
with him 

meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so  that
people ran about with flaring links  proffering their
services to go before horses in carriages  and conduct
them on their way  the ancient tower of a church 
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall  became
invisible  and struck the hours and quarters in the
clouds  with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if
its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there 
the cold became intense  in the main street  at the
corner of the court  some labourers were repairing
the gas pipes  and had lighted a great fire in a brazier 
round which a party of ragged men and boys were
gathered  warming their hands and winking their
eyes before the blaze in rapture  the water plug
being left in solitude  its overflowings sullenly congealed 
and turned to misanthropic ice  the brightness
of the shops where holly sprigs and berries
crackled in the lamp heat of the windows  made pale
faces ruddy as they passed  poulterers  and grocers 
trades became a splendid joke  a glorious pageant 
with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything
to do  the lord mayor  in the stronghold of the
mighty mansion house  gave orders to his fifty cooks
and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayor  
household should  and even the little tailor  whom he
had fined five shillings on the previous monday for
being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets  stirred up
to morrow   pudding in his garret  while his lean
wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef 

foggier yet  and colder  piercing  searching  biting
cold  if the good saint dunstan had but nipped
the evil spirit   nose with a touch of such weather
as that  instead of using his familiar weapons  then
indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose  the
owner of one scant young nose  gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs 
stooped down at scrooge   keyhole to regale him with
a christmas carol  but at the first sound of

         god bless you  merry gentleman 
         may nothing you dismay  

scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action 
that the singer fled in terror  leaving the keyhole to
the fog and even more congenial frost 

at length the hour of shutting up the counting house
arrived  with an ill will scrooge dismounted from his
stool  and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant
clerk in the tank  who instantly snuffed his candle out 
and put on his hat 

 you ll want all day to morrow  i suppose   said
scrooge 

 if quite convenient  sir  

 it   not convenient   said scrooge   and it   not
fair  if i was to stop half a crown for it  you  
think yourself ill used  i ll be bound  

the clerk smiled faintly 

 and yet   said scrooge   you don   think me ill used 
when i pay a day   wages for no work  

the clerk observed that it was only once a year 

 a poor excuse for picking a man   pocket every
twenty fifth of december   said scrooge  buttoning
his great coat to the chin   but i suppose you must
have the whole day  be here all the earlier next
morning  

the clerk promised that he would  and scrooge
walked out with a growl  the office was closed in a
twinkling  and the clerk  with the long ends of his
white comforter dangling below his waist  for he
boasted no great coat   went down a slide on cornhill 
at the end of a lane of boys  twenty times  in
honour of its being christmas eve  and then ran home
to camden town as hard as he could pelt  to play
at blindman   buff 

scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern  and having read all the newspapers  and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
banker   book  went home to bed  he lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner  they were a gloomy suite of rooms  in a
lowering pile of building up a yard  where it had so
little business to be  that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house  playing at hide and seek with other houses 
and forgotten the way out again  it was old enough
now  and dreary enough  for nobody lived in it but
scrooge  the other rooms being all let out as offices 
the yard was so dark that even scrooge  who knew
its every stone  was fain to grope with his hands 
the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house  that it seemed as if the genius of
the weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold 

now  it is a fact  that there was nothing at all
particular about the knocker on the door  except that it
was very large  it is also a fact  that scrooge had
seen it  night and morning  during his whole residence
in that place  also that scrooge had as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
london  even including  which is a bold word  the
corporation  aldermen  and livery  let it also be
borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on marley  since his last mention of his
seven years  dead partner that afternoon  and then
let any man explain to me  if he can  how it happened
that scrooge  having his key in the lock of the door 
saw in the knocker  without its undergoing any intermediate
process of change  not a knocker  but marley   face 

marley   face  it was not in impenetrable shadow
as the other objects in the yard were  but had a
dismal light about it  like a bad lobster in a dark
cellar  it was not angry or ferocious  but looked
at scrooge as marley used to look  with ghostly
spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead  the
hair was curiously stirred  as if by breath or hot air 
and  though the eyes were wide open  they were perfectly
motionless  that  and its livid colour  made it
horrible  but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
face and beyond its control  rather than a part of
its own expression 

as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon  it
was a knocker again 

to say that he was not startled  or that his blood
was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
had been a stranger from infancy  would be untrue 
but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished 
turned it sturdily  walked in  and lighted his candle 

he did pause  with a moment   irresolution  before
he shut the door  and he did look cautiously behind
it first  as if he half expected to be terrified with the
sight of marley   pigtail sticking out into the hall 
but there was nothing on the back of the door  except
the screws and nuts that held the knocker on  so he
said  pooh  pooh   and closed it with a bang 

the sound resounded through the house like thunder 
every room above  and every cask in the wine merchant  
cellars below  appeared to have a separate peal
of echoes of its own  scrooge was not a man to
be frightened by echoes  he fastened the door  and
walked across the hall  and up the stairs  slowly too 
trimming his candle as he went 

you may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six
up a good old flight of stairs  or through a bad
young act of parliament  but i mean to say you
might have got a hearse up that staircase  and taken
it broadwise  with the splinter bar towards the wall
and the door towards the balustrades  and done it
easy  there was plenty of width for that  and room
to spare  which is perhaps the reason why scrooge
thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before
him in the gloom  half a dozen gas lamps out of
the street wouldn   have lighted the entry too well 
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with
scrooge   dip 

up scrooge went  not caring a button for that 
darkness is cheap  and scrooge liked it  but before
he shut his heavy door  he walked through his rooms
to see that all was right  he had just enough recollection
of the face to desire to do that 

sitting room  bedroom  lumber room  all as they
should be  nobody under the table  nobody under
the sofa  a small fire in the grate  spoon and basin
ready  and the little saucepan of gruel  scrooge had
a cold in his head  upon the hob  nobody under the
bed  nobody in the closet  nobody in his dressing gown 
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall  lumber room as usual  old fire guard 
old shoes  two fish baskets  washing stand on three
legs  and a poker 

quite satisfied  he closed his door  and locked
himself in  double locked himself in  which was not his
custom  thus secured against surprise  he took off
his cravat  put on his dressing gown and slippers  and
his nightcap  and sat down before the fire to take
his gruel 

it was a very low fire indeed  nothing on such a
bitter night  he was obliged to sit close to it  and
brood over it  before he could extract the least
sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel 
the fireplace was an old one  built by some dutch
merchant long ago  and paved all round with quaint
dutch tiles  designed to illustrate the scriptures 
there were cains and abels  pharaoh   daughters 
queens of sheba  angelic messengers descending
through the air on clouds like feather beds  abrahams 
belshazzars  apostles putting off to sea in butter boats 
hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts 
and yet that face of marley  seven years dead  came
like the ancient prophet   rod  and swallowed up the
whole  if each smooth tile had been a blank at first 
with power to shape some picture on its surface from
the disjointed fragments of his thoughts  there would
have been a copy of old marley   head on every one 

 humbug   said scrooge  and walked across the
room 

after several turns  he sat down again  as he
threw his head back in the chair  his glance happened
to rest upon a bell  a disused bell  that hung in the
room  and communicated for some purpose now forgotten
with a chamber in the highest story of the
building  it was with great astonishment  and with
a strange  inexplicable dread  that as he looked  he
saw this bell begin to swing  it swung so softly in
the outset that it scarcely made a sound  but soon it
rang out loudly  and so did every bell in the house 

this might have lasted half a minute  or a minute 
but it seemed an hour  the bells ceased as they had
begun  together  they were succeeded by a clanking
noise  deep down below  as if some person were
dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
wine merchant   cellar  scrooge then remembered to have
heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
dragging chains 

the cellar door flew open with a booming sound 
and then he heard the noise much louder  on the floors
below  then coming up the stairs  then coming straight
towards his door 

 it   humbug still   said scrooge   i won   believe it  

his colour changed though  when  without a pause 
it came on through the heavy door  and passed into
the room before his eyes  upon its coming in  the
dying flame leaped up  as though it cried   i know
him  marley   ghost   and fell again 

the same face  the very same  marley in his pigtail 
usual waistcoat  tights and boots  the tassels on
the latter bristling  like his pigtail  and his coat skirts 
and the hair upon his head  the chain he drew was
clasped about his middle  it was long  and wound
about him like a tail  and it was made  for scrooge
observed it closely  of cash boxes  keys  padlocks 
ledgers  deeds  and heavy purses wrought in steel 
his body was transparent  so that scrooge  observing him 
and looking through his waistcoat  could see
the two buttons on his coat behind 

scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no
bowels  but he had never believed it until now 

no  nor did he believe it even now  though he
looked the phantom through and through  and saw
it standing before him  though he felt the chilling
influence of its death cold eyes  and marked the very
texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head
and chin  which wrapper he had not observed before 
he was still incredulous  and fought against his senses 

 how now   said scrooge  caustic and cold as ever 
 what do you want with me  

 much    marley   voice  no doubt about it 

 who are you  

 ask me who i was  

 who were you then   said scrooge  raising his
voice   you re particular  for a shade   he was going
to say  to a shade   but substituted this  as more
appropriate 

 in life i was your partner  jacob marley  

 can you  can you sit down   asked scrooge  looking
doubtfully at him 

 i can  

 do it  then  

scrooge asked the question  because he didn   know
whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
a condition to take a chair  and felt that in the event
of its being impossible  it might involve the necessity
of an embarrassing explanation  but the ghost sat
down on the opposite side of the fireplace  as if he
were quite used to it 

 you don   believe in me   observed the ghost 

 i don     said scrooge 

 what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
your senses  

 i don   know   said scrooge 

 why do you doubt your senses  

 because   said scrooge   a little thing affects them 
a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats  you may
be an undigested bit of beef  a blot of mustard  a crumb of
cheese  a fragment of an underdone potato  there   more of
gravy than of grave about you  whatever you are  

scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking
jokes  nor did he feel  in his heart  by any means
waggish then  the truth is  that he tried to be
smart  as a means of distracting his own attention 
and keeping down his terror  for the spectre   voice
disturbed the very marrow in his bones 

to sit  staring at those fixed glazed eyes  in silence
for a moment  would play  scrooge felt  the very
deuce with him  there was something very awful 
too  in the spectre   being provided with an infernal
atmosphere of its own  scrooge could not feel it
himself  but this was clearly the case  for though the
ghost sat perfectly motionless  its hair  and skirts 
and tassels  were still agitated as by the hot vapour
from an oven 

 you see this toothpick   said scrooge  returning
quickly to the charge  for the reason just assigned 
and wishing  though it were only for a second  to
divert the vision   stony gaze from himself 

 i do   replied the ghost 

 you are not looking at it   said scrooge 

 but i see it   said the ghost   notwithstanding  

 well   returned scrooge   i have but to swallow
this  and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a
legion of goblins  all of my own creation  humbug 
i tell you  humbug  

at this the spirit raised a frightful cry  and shook
its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise  that
scrooge held on tight to his chair  to save himself
from falling in a swoon  but how much greater was
his horror  when the phantom taking off the bandage
round its head  as if it were too warm to wear indoors 
its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast 

scrooge fell upon his knees  and clasped his hands
before his face 

 mercy   he said   dreadful apparition  why do
you trouble me  

 man of the worldly mind   replied the ghost   do
you believe in me or not  

 i do   said scrooge   i must  but why do spirits
walk the earth  and why do they come to me  

 it is required of every man   the ghost returned 
 that the spirit within him should walk abroad among
his fellowmen  and travel far and wide  and if that
spirit goes not forth in life  it is condemned to do so
after death  it is doomed to wander through the
world  oh  woe is me   and witness what it cannot
share  but might have shared on earth  and turned to
happiness  

again the spectre raised a cry  and shook its chain
and wrung its shadowy hands 

 you are fettered   said scrooge  trembling   tell
me why  

 i wear the chain i forged in life   replied the ghost 
 i made it link by link  and yard by yard  i girded
it on of my own free will  and of my own free will i
wore it  is its pattern strange to you  

scrooge trembled more and more 

 or would you know   pursued the ghost   the
weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself 
it was full as heavy and as long as this  seven
christmas eves ago  you have laboured on it  since 
it is a ponderous chain  

scrooge glanced about him on the floor  in the
expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
or sixty fathoms of iron cable  but he could see
nothing 

 jacob   he said  imploringly   old jacob marley 
tell me more  speak comfort to me  jacob  

 i have none to give   the ghost replied   it comes
from other regions  ebenezer scrooge  and is conveyed
by other ministers  to other kinds of men  nor
can i tell you what i would  a very little more is
all permitted to me  i cannot rest  i cannot stay  i
cannot linger anywhere  my spirit never walked
beyond our counting house  mark me   in life my
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
money changing hole  and weary journeys lie before
me  

it was a habit with scrooge  whenever he became
thoughtful  to put his hands in his breeches pockets 
pondering on what the ghost had said  he did so now 
but without lifting up his eyes  or getting off his
knees 

 you must have been very slow about it  jacob  
scrooge observed  in a business like manner  though
with humility and deference 

 slow   the ghost repeated 

 seven years dead   mused scrooge   and travelling
all the time  

 the whole time   said the ghost   no rest  no
peace  incessant torture of remorse  

 you travel fast   said scrooge 

 on the wings of the wind   replied the ghost 

 you might have got over a great quantity of
ground in seven years   said scrooge 

the ghost  on hearing this  set up another cry  and
clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of
the night  that the ward would have been justified in
indicting it for a nuisance 

 oh  captive  bound  and double ironed   cried the
phantom   not to know  that ages of incessant labour
by immortal creatures  for this earth must pass into
eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is
all developed  not to know that any christian spirit
working kindly in its little sphere  whatever it may
be  will find its mortal life too short for its vast
means of usefulness  not to know that no space of
regret can make amends for one life   opportunity
misused  yet such was i  oh  such was i  

 but you were always a good man of business 
jacob   faltered scrooge  who now began to apply this
to himself 

 business   cried the ghost  wringing its hands
again   mankind was my business  the common
welfare was my business  charity  mercy  forbearance 
and benevolence  were  all  my business  the dealings
of my trade were but a drop of water in the
comprehensive ocean of my business  

it held up its chain at arm   length  as if that were
the cause of all its unavailing grief  and flung it
heavily upon the ground again 

 at this time of the rolling year   the spectre said 
 i suffer most  why did i walk through crowds of
fellow beings with my eyes turned down  and never
raise them to that blessed star which led the wise
men to a poor abode  were there no poor homes to
which its light would have conducted me  

scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the
spectre going on at this rate  and began to quake
exceedingly 

 hear me   cried the ghost   my time is nearly
gone  

 i will   said scrooge   but don   be hard upon
me  don   be flowery  jacob  pray  

 how it is that i appear before you in a shape that
you can see  i may not tell  i have sat invisible
beside you many and many a day  

it was not an agreeable idea  scrooge shivered 
and wiped the perspiration from his brow 

 that is no light part of my penance   pursued
the ghost   i am here to night to warn you  that you
have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate  a
chance and hope of my procuring  ebenezer  

 you were always a good friend to me   said
scrooge   thank ee  

 you will be haunted   resumed the ghost   by
three spirits  

scrooge   countenance fell almost as low as the
ghost   had done 

 is that the chance and hope you mentioned 
jacob   he demanded  in a faltering voice 

 it is  

 i  i think i   rather not   said scrooge 

 without their visits   said the ghost   you cannot
hope to shun the path i tread  expect the first to morrow 
when the bell tolls one  

 couldn   i take  em all at once  and have it over 
jacob   hinted scrooge 

 expect the second on the next night at the same
hour  the third upon the next night when the last
stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate  look to see
me no more  and look that  for your own sake  you
remember what has passed between us  

when it had said these words  the spectre took its
wrapper from the table  and bound it round its head 
as before  scrooge knew this  by the smart sound its
teeth made  when the jaws were brought together
by the bandage  he ventured to raise his eyes again 
and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
in an erect attitude  with its chain wound over and
about its arm 

the apparition walked backward from him  and at
every step it took  the window raised itself a little 
so that when the spectre reached it  it was wide open 

it beckoned scrooge to approach  which he did 
when they were within two paces of each other 
marley   ghost held up its hand  warning him to
come no nearer  scrooge stopped 

not so much in obedience  as in surprise and fear 
for on the raising of the hand  he became sensible
of confused noises in the air  incoherent sounds of
lamentation and regret  wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and
self accusatory  the spectre  after listening for a moment 
joined in the mournful dirge  and floated out upon the
bleak  dark night 

scrooge followed to the window  desperate in his
curiosity  he looked out 

the air was filled with phantoms  wandering hither
and thither in restless haste  and moaning as they
went  every one of them wore chains like marley  
ghost  some few  they might be guilty governments 
were linked together  none were free  many had
been personally known to scrooge in their lives  he
had been quite familiar with one old ghost  in a white
waistcoat  with a monstrous iron safe attached to
its ankle  who cried piteously at being unable to assist
a wretched woman with an infant  whom it saw below 
upon a door step  the misery with them all was 
clearly  that they sought to interfere  for good  in
human matters  and had lost the power for ever 

whether these creatures faded into mist  or mist
enshrouded them  he could not tell  but they and
their spirit voices faded together  and the night became
as it had been when he walked home 

scrooge closed the window  and examined the door
by which the ghost had entered  it was double locked 
as he had locked it with his own hands  and
the bolts were undisturbed  he tried to say  humbug  
but stopped at the first syllable  and being 
from the emotion he had undergone  or the fatigues
of the day  or his glimpse of the invisible world  or
the dull conversation of the ghost  or the lateness of
the hour  much in need of repose  went straight to
bed  without undressing  and fell asleep upon the
instant 


stave ii   the first of the three spirits

when scrooge awoke  it was so dark  that looking out of bed 
he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from
the opaque walls of his chamber  he was endeavouring to
pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes  when the chimes of a
neighbouring church struck the four quarters  so he listened
for the hour 

to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from
six to seven  and from seven to eight  and regularly up to
twelve  then stopped  twelve  it was past two when he
went to bed  the clock was wrong  an icicle must have
got into the works  twelve 

he touched the spring of his repeater  to correct this most
preposterous clock  its rapid little pulse beat twelve 
and stopped 

 why  it isn   possible   said scrooge   that i can have
slept through a whole day and far into another night  it
isn   possible that anything has happened to the sun  and
this is twelve at noon  

the idea being an alarming one  he scrambled out of bed 
and groped his way to the window  he was obliged to rub
the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing gown before he
could see anything  and could see very little then  all he
could make out was  that it was still very foggy and extremely
cold  and that there was no noise of people running to and fro 
and making a great stir  as there unquestionably would have been
if night had beaten off bright day  and taken possession of the
world   this was a great relief  because  three days after sight
of this first of exchange pay to mr  ebenezer scrooge or his
order   and so forth  would have become a mere united states 
security if there were no days to count by 

scrooge went to bed again  and thought  and thought  and thought
it over and over and over  and could make nothing of it   the more he
thought  the more perplexed he was  and the more he endeavoured
not to think  the more he thought 

marley   ghost bothered him exceedingly  every time he resolved
within himself  after mature inquiry  that it was all a dream  his
mind flew back again  like a strong spring released  to its first
position  and presented the same problem to be worked all through 
 was it a dream or not  

scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters
more  when he remembered  on a sudden  that the ghost had warned
him of a visitation when the bell tolled one   he resolved to lie
awake until the hour was passed  and  considering that he could
no more go to sleep than go to heaven  this was perhaps the
wisest resolution in his power 

the quarter was so long  that he was more than once convinced he
must have sunk into a doze unconsciously  and missed the clock 
at length it broke upon his listening ear 

 ding  dong  

 a quarter past   said scrooge  counting 

 ding  dong  

 half past   said scrooge 

 ding  dong  

 a quarter to it   said scrooge 

 ding  dong  

 the hour itself   said scrooge  triumphantly   and nothing else  

he spoke before the hour bell sounded  which it now did with a
deep  dull  hollow  melancholy one   light flashed up in the room
upon the instant  and the curtains of his bed were drawn 

the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  i tell you  by a
hand  not the curtains at his feet  nor the curtains at his
back  but those to which his face was addressed  the curtains
of his bed were drawn aside  and scrooge  starting up into a
half recumbent attitude  found himself face to face with the
unearthly visitor who drew them  as close to it as i am now
to you  and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow 

it was a strange figure  like a child  yet not so like a
child as like an old man  viewed through some supernatural
medium  which gave him the appearance of having receded
from the view  and being diminished to a child   proportions 
its hair  which hung about its neck and down its back  was
white as if with age  and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it  and the tenderest bloom was on the skin  the arms were
very long and muscular  the hands the same  as if its hold
were of uncommon strength  its legs and feet  most delicately
formed  were  like those upper members  bare  it wore a tunic
of the purest white  and round its waist was bound
a lustrous belt  the sheen of which was beautiful  it held
a branch of fresh green holly in its hand  and  in singular
contradiction of that wintry emblem  had its dress trimmed
with summer flowers  but the strangest thing about it was 
that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
jet of light  by which all this was visible  and which was
doubtless the occasion of its using  in its duller moments  a
great extinguisher for a cap  which it now held under its arm 

even this  though  when scrooge looked at it with increasing
steadiness  was not its strangest quality  for as its belt
sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another 
and what was light one instant  at another time was dark  so
the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness  being now a
thing with one arm  now with one leg  now with twenty legs 
now a pair of legs without a head  now a head without a
body  of which dissolving parts  no outline would be visible
in the dense gloom wherein they melted away  and in the
very wonder of this  it would be itself again  distinct and
clear as ever 

 are you the spirit  sir  whose coming was foretold to
me   asked scrooge 

 i am  

the voice was soft and gentle  singularly low  as if
instead of being so close beside him  it were at a distance 

 who  and what are you   scrooge demanded 

 i am the ghost of christmas past  

 long past   inquired scrooge  observant of its dwarfish
stature 

 no  your past  

perhaps  scrooge could not have told anybody why  if
anybody could have asked him  but he had a special desire
to see the spirit in his cap  and begged him to be covered 

 what   exclaimed the ghost   would you so soon put out 
with worldly hands  the light i give  is it not enough
that you are one of those whose passions made this cap  and
force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
my brow  

scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend
or any knowledge of having wilfully  bonneted  the spirit at
any period of his life  he then made bold to inquire what
business brought him there 

 your welfare   said the ghost 

scrooge expressed himself much obliged  but could not
help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been
more conducive to that end  the spirit must have heard
him thinking  for it said immediately 

 your reclamation  then  take heed  

it put out its strong hand as it spoke  and clasped him
gently by the arm 

 rise  and walk with me  

it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the
weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes 
that bed was warm  and the thermometer a long way below
freezing  that he was clad but lightly in his slippers 
dressing gown  and nightcap  and that he had a cold upon him at
that time  the grasp  though gentle as a woman   hand 
was not to be resisted  he rose  but finding that the spirit
made towards the window  clasped his robe in supplication 

 i am a mortal   scrooge remonstrated   and liable to fall  

 bear but a touch of my hand there   said the spirit 
laying it upon his heart   and you shall be upheld in more
than this  

as the words were spoken  they passed through the wall 
and stood upon an open country road  with fields on either
hand  the city had entirely vanished  not a vestige of it
was to be seen  the darkness and the mist had vanished
with it  for it was a clear  cold  winter day  with snow upon
the ground 

 good heaven   said scrooge  clasping his hands together 
as he looked about him   i was bred in this place  i was
a boy here  

the spirit gazed upon him mildly  its gentle touch 
though it had been light and instantaneous  appeared still
present to the old man   sense of feeling  he was conscious
of a thousand odours floating in the air  each one connected
with a thousand thoughts  and hopes  and joys  and cares
long  long  forgotten 

 your lip is trembling   said the ghost   and what is
that upon your cheek  

scrooge muttered  with an unusual catching in his voice 
that it was a pimple  and begged the ghost to lead him
where he would 

 you recollect the way   inquired the spirit 

 remember it   cried scrooge with fervour   i could
walk it blindfold  

 strange to have forgotten it for so many years   observed
the ghost   let us go on  

they walked along the road  scrooge recognising every
gate  and post  and tree  until a little market town appeared
in the distance  with its bridge  its church  and winding river 
some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them
with boys upon their backs  who called to other boys in
country gigs and carts  driven by farmers  all these boys
were in great spirits  and shouted to each other  until the
broad fields were so full of merry music  that the crisp air
laughed to hear it 

 these are but shadows of the things that have been   said
the ghost   they have no consciousness of us  

the jocund travellers came on  and as they came  scrooge
knew and named them every one  why was he rejoiced beyond
all bounds to see them  why did his cold eye glisten  and
his heart leap up as they went past  why was he filled
with gladness when he heard them give each other merry
christmas  as they parted at cross roads and bye ways  for
their several homes  what was merry christmas to scrooge 
out upon merry christmas  what good had it ever done
to him 

 the school is not quite deserted   said the ghost   a
solitary child  neglected by his friends  is left there still  

scrooge said he knew it  and he sobbed 

they left the high road  by a well remembered lane  and
soon approached a mansion of dull red brick  with a little
weathercock surmounted cupola  on the roof  and a bell
hanging in it  it was a large house  but one of broken
fortunes  for the spacious offices were little used  their walls
were damp and mossy  their windows broken  and their
gates decayed  fowls clucked and strutted in the stables 
and the coach houses and sheds were over run with grass 
nor was it more retentive of its ancient state  within  for
entering the dreary hall  and glancing through the open
doors of many rooms  they found them poorly furnished 
cold  and vast  there was an earthy savour in the air  a
chilly bareness in the place  which associated itself somehow
with too much getting up by candle light  and not too
much to eat 

they went  the ghost and scrooge  across the hall  to a
door at the back of the house  it opened before them  and
disclosed a long  bare  melancholy room  made barer still by
lines of plain deal forms and desks  at one of these a lonely
boy was reading near a feeble fire  and scrooge sat down
upon a form  and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he
used to be 

not a latent echo in the house  not a squeak and scuffle
from the mice behind the panelling  not a drip from the
half thawed water spout in the dull yard behind  not a sigh among
the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar  not the idle
swinging of an empty store house door  no  not a clicking in
the fire  but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening
influence  and gave a freer passage to his tears 

the spirit touched him on the arm  and pointed to his
younger self  intent upon his reading  suddenly a man  in
foreign garments  wonderfully real and distinct to look at 
stood outside the window  with an axe stuck in his belt  and
leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood 

 why  it   ali baba   scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy   it  
dear old honest ali baba  yes  yes  i know  one christmas
time  when yonder solitary child was left here all alone 
he did come  for the first time  just like that  poor boy  and
valentine   said scrooge   and his wild brother  orson  there
they go  and what   his name  who was put down in his
drawers  asleep  at the gate of damascus  don   you see him 
and the sultan   groom turned upside down by the genii 
there he is upon his head  serve him right  i   glad of it 
what business had he to be married to the princess  

to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature
on such subjects  in a most extraordinary voice between
laughing and crying  and to see his heightened and excited
face  would have been a surprise to his business friends in
the city  indeed 

 there   the parrot   cried scrooge   green body and
yellow tail  with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
top of his head  there he is  poor robin crusoe  he called
him  when he came home again after sailing round the
island   poor robin crusoe  where have you been  robin
crusoe    the man thought he was dreaming  but he wasn   
it was the parrot  you know  there goes friday  running
for his life to the little creek  halloa  hoop  halloo  

then  with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his
usual character  he said  in pity for his former self   poor
boy   and cried again 

 i wish   scrooge muttered  putting his hand in his
pocket  and looking about him  after drying his eyes with his
cuff   but it   too late now  

 what is the matter   asked the spirit 

 nothing   said scrooge   nothing  there was a boy
singing a christmas carol at my door last night  i should
like to have given him something  that   all  

the ghost smiled thoughtfully  and waved its hand 
saying as it did so   let us see another christmas  

scrooge   former self grew larger at the words  and the
room became a little darker and more dirty  the panels shrunk 
the windows cracked  fragments of plaster fell out of the
ceiling  and the naked laths were shown instead  but how
all this was brought about  scrooge knew no more than you
do  he only knew that it was quite correct  that everything
had happened so  that there he was  alone again  when all
the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays 

he was not reading now  but walking up and down despairingly 
scrooge looked at the ghost  and with a mournful shaking of
his head  glanced anxiously towards the door 

it opened  and a little girl  much younger than the boy 
came darting in  and putting her arms about his neck  and
often kissing him  addressed him as her  dear  dear
brother  

 i have come to bring you home  dear brother   said the
child  clapping her tiny hands  and bending down to laugh 
 to bring you home  home  home  

 home  little fan   returned the boy 

 yes   said the child  brimful of glee   home  for good
and all  home  for ever and ever  father is so much kinder
than he used to be  that home   like heaven  he spoke so
gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed  that
i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home  and he said yes  you should  and sent me in a coach
to bring you  and you re to be a man   said the child 
opening her eyes   and are never to come back here  but
first  we re to be together all the christmas long  and have
the merriest time in all the world  

 you are quite a woman  little fan   exclaimed the boy 

she clapped her hands and laughed  and tried to touch his
head  but being too little  laughed again  and stood on
tiptoe to embrace him  then she began to drag him  in her
childish eagerness  towards the door  and he  nothing loth to
go  accompanied her 

a terrible voice in the hall cried   bring down master
scrooge   box  there   and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster
himself  who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious
condescension  and threw him into a dreadful state of mind
by shaking hands with him  he then conveyed him and his
sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that
ever was seen  where the maps upon the wall  and the celestial
and terrestrial globes in the windows  were waxy with cold 
here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine  and a
block of curiously heavy cake  and administered instalments
of those dainties to the young people  at the same time 
sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of  something 
to the postboy  who answered that he thanked the gentleman 
but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before  he had
rather not  master scrooge   trunk being by this time tied
on to the top of the chaise  the children bade the schoolmaster
good bye right willingly  and getting into it  drove
gaily down the garden sweep  the quick wheels dashing the
hoar frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens
like spray 

 always a delicate creature  whom a breath might have
withered   said the ghost   but she had a large heart  

 so she had   cried scrooge   you re right  i will not
gainsay it  spirit  god forbid  

 she died a woman   said the ghost   and had  as i think 
children  

 one child   scrooge returned 

 true   said the ghost   your nephew  

scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind  and answered briefly 
 yes  

although they had but that moment left the school behind
them  they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city 
where shadowy passengers passed and repassed  where shadowy
carts and coaches battled for the way  and all the strife and
tumult of a real city were  it was made plain enough  by
the dressing of the shops  that here too it was christmas
time again  but it was evening  and the streets were
lighted up 

the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door  and asked
scrooge if he knew it 

 know it   said scrooge   was i apprenticed here  

they went in  at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh
wig  sitting behind such a high desk  that if he had been two
inches taller he must have knocked his head against the
ceiling  scrooge cried in great excitement 

 why  it   old fezziwig  bless his heart  it   fezziwig
alive again  

old fezziwig laid down his pen  and looked up at the
clock  which pointed to the hour of seven  he rubbed his
hands  adjusted his capacious waistcoat  laughed all over
himself  from his shoes to his organ of benevolence  and
called out in a comfortable  oily  rich  fat  jovial voice 

 yo ho  there  ebenezer  dick  

scrooge   former self  now grown a young man  came briskly
in  accompanied by his fellow  prentice 

 dick wilkins  to be sure   said scrooge to the ghost 
 bless me  yes  there he is  he was very much attached
to me  was dick  poor dick  dear  dear  

 yo ho  my boys   said fezziwig   no more work to night 
christmas eve  dick  christmas  ebenezer  let  
have the shutters up   cried old fezziwig  with a sharp clap
of his hands   before a man can say jack robinson  

you wouldn   believe how those two fellows went at it 
they charged into the street with the shutters  one  two 
three  had  em up in their places  four  five  six  barred
 em and pinned  em  seven  eight  nine  and came back
before you could have got to twelve  panting like race horses 

 hilli ho   cried old fezziwig  skipping down from the
high desk  with wonderful agility   clear away  my lads 
and let   have lots of room here  hilli ho  dick  chirrup 
ebenezer  

clear away  there was nothing they wouldn   have cleared
away  or couldn   have cleared away  with old fezziwig looking
on  it was done in a minute  every movable was packed off  as if
it were dismissed from public life for evermore  the floor was
swept and watered  the lamps were trimmed  fuel was heaped upon
the fire  and the warehouse was as snug  and warm  and dry  and
bright a ball room  as you would desire to see upon a winter  
night 

in came a fiddler with a music book  and went up to the
lofty desk  and made an orchestra of it  and tuned like fifty
stomach aches  in came mrs  fezziwig  one vast substantial
smile  in came the three miss fezziwigs  beaming and
lovable  in came the six young followers whose hearts they
broke  in came all the young men and women employed in
the business  in came the housemaid  with her cousin  the
baker  in came the cook  with her brother   particular friend 
the milkman  in came the boy from over the way  who was
suspected of not having board enough from his master  trying
to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one  who
was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress 
in they all came  one after another  some shyly  some boldly 
some gracefully  some awkwardly  some pushing  some pulling 
in they all came  anyhow and everyhow  away they all went 
twenty couple at once  hands half round and back again
the other way  down the middle and up again  round
and round in various stages of affectionate grouping  old
top couple always turning up in the wrong place  new top
couple starting off again  as soon as they got there  all top
couples at last  and not a bottom one to help them  when
this result was brought about  old fezziwig  clapping his
hands to stop the dance  cried out   well done   and the
fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter  especially
provided for that purpose  but scorning rest  upon his
reappearance  he instantly began again  though there were no
dancers yet  as if the other fiddler had been carried home 
exhausted  on a shutter  and he were a bran new man
resolved to beat him out of sight  or perish 

there were more dances  and there were forfeits  and more
dances  and there was cake  and there was negus  and there
was a great piece of cold roast  and there was a great piece
of cold boiled  and there were mince pies  and plenty of beer 
but the great effect of the evening came after the roast
and boiled  when the fiddler  an artful dog  mind  the sort
of man who knew his business better than you or i could
have told it him   struck up  sir roger de coverley    then
old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs  fezziwig  top
couple  too  with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them 
three or four and twenty pair of partners  people who were
not to be trifled with  people who would dance  and had no
notion of walking 

but if they had been twice as many  ah  four times  old
fezziwig would have been a match for them  and so would
mrs  fezziwig  as to her  she was worthy to be his partner
in every sense of the term  if that   not high praise  tell me
higher  and i ll use it  a positive light appeared to issue
from fezziwig   calves  they shone in every part of the
dance like moons  you couldn   have predicted  at any given
time  what would have become of them next  and when old
fezziwig and mrs  fezziwig had gone all through the dance 
advance and retire  both hands to your partner  bow and
curtsey  corkscrew  thread the needle  and back again to
your place  fezziwig  cut   cut so deftly  that he appeared
to wink with his legs  and came upon his feet again without
a stagger 

when the clock struck eleven  this domestic ball broke up 
mr  and mrs  fezziwig took their stations  one on either side
of the door  and shaking hands with every person individually
as he or she went out  wished him or her a merry christmas 
when everybody had retired but the two  prentices  they did
the same to them  and thus the cheerful voices died away 
and the lads were left to their beds  which were under a
counter in the back shop 

during the whole of this time  scrooge had acted like a
man out of his wits  his heart and soul were in the scene 
and with his former self  he corroborated everything 
remembered everything  enjoyed everything  and underwent
the strangest agitation  it was not until now  when the
bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from
them  that he remembered the ghost  and became conscious
that it was looking full upon him  while the light upon its
head burnt very clear 

 a small matter   said the ghost   to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude  

 small   echoed scrooge 

the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices 
who were pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig 
and when he had done so  said 

 why  is it not  he has spent but a few pounds of
your mortal money  three or four perhaps  is that so
much that he deserves this praise  

 it isn   that   said scrooge  heated by the remark  and
speaking unconsciously like his former  not his latter  self 
 it isn   that  spirit  he has the power to render us happy
or unhappy  to make our service light or burdensome  a
pleasure or a toil  say that his power lies in words and
looks  in things so slight and insignificant that it is
impossible to add and count  em up  what then  the happiness
he gives  is quite as great as if it cost a fortune  

he felt the spirit   glance  and stopped 

 what is the matter   asked the ghost 

 nothing particular   said scrooge 

 something  i think   the ghost insisted 

 no   said scrooge   no  i should like to be able to say
a word or two to my clerk just now  that   all  

his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance
to the wish  and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by
side in the open air 

 my time grows short   observed the spirit   quick  

this was not addressed to scrooge  or to any one whom he
could see  but it produced an immediate effect  for again
scrooge saw himself  he was older now  a man in the prime
of life  his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later
years  but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice 
there was an eager  greedy  restless motion in the eye  which
showed the passion that had taken root  and where the
shadow of the growing tree would fall 

he was not alone  but sat by the side of a fair young
girl in a mourning dress  in whose eyes there were tears 
which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of
christmas past 

 it matters little   she said  softly   to you  very little 
another idol has displaced me  and if it can cheer and comfort
you in time to come  as i would have tried to do  i have
no just cause to grieve  

 what idol has displaced you   he rejoined 

 a golden one  

 this is the even handed dealing of the world   he said 
 there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty  and
there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity
as the pursuit of wealth  

 you fear the world too much   she answered  gently 
 all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being
beyond the chance of its sordid reproach  i have seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one  until the master passion 
gain  engrosses you  have i not  

 what then   he retorted   even if i have grown so
much wiser  what then  i am not changed towards you  

she shook her head 

 am i  

 our contract is an old one  it was made when we were
both poor and content to be so  until  in good season  we could
improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry  you
are changed  when it was made  you were another man  

 i was a boy   he said impatiently 

 your own feeling tells you that you were not what you
are   she returned   i am  that which promised happiness
when we were one in heart  is fraught with misery now that
we are two  how often and how keenly i have thought of
this  i will not say  it is enough that i have thought of it 
and can release you  

 have i ever sought release  

 in words  no  never  

 in what  then  

 in a changed nature  in an altered spirit  in another
atmosphere of life  another hope as its great end  in
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
sight  if this had never been between us   said the girl 
looking mildly  but with steadiness  upon him   tell me 
would you seek me out and try to win me now  ah  no  

he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition  in
spite of himself  but he said with a struggle   you think
not  

 i would gladly think otherwise if i could   she answered 
 heaven knows  when i have learned a truth like this 
i know how strong and irresistible it must be  but if you
were free to day  to morrow  yesterday  can even i believe
that you would choose a dowerless girl  you who  in your
very confidence with her  weigh everything by gain  or 
choosing her  if for a moment you were false enough to your
one guiding principle to do so  do i not know that your
repentance and regret would surely follow  i do  and i
release you  with a full heart  for the love of him you
once were  

he was about to speak  but with her head turned from
him  she resumed 

 you may  the memory of what is past half makes me
hope you will  have pain in this  a very  very brief time 
and you will dismiss the recollection of it  gladly  as an
unprofitable dream  from which it happened well that you
awoke  may you be happy in the life you have chosen  

she left him  and they parted 

 spirit   said scrooge   show me no more  conduct
me home  why do you delight to torture me  

 one shadow more   exclaimed the ghost 

 no more   cried scrooge   no more  i don   wish to
see it  show me no more  

but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms 
and forced him to observe what happened next 

they were in another scene and place  a room  not very
large or handsome  but full of comfort  near to the winter
fire sat a beautiful young girl  so like that last that scrooge
believed it was the same  until he saw her  now a comely
matron  sitting opposite her daughter  the noise in this
room was perfectly tumultuous  for there were more children
there  than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count 
and  unlike the celebrated herd in the poem  they were not
forty children conducting themselves like one  but every
child was conducting itself like forty  the consequences
were uproarious beyond belief  but no one seemed to care 
on the contrary  the mother and daughter laughed heartily 
and enjoyed it very much  and the latter  soon beginning to
mingle in the sports  got pillaged by the young brigands
most ruthlessly  what would i not have given to be one of
them  though i never could have been so rude  no  no  i
wouldn   for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
braided hair  and torn it down  and for the precious little
shoe  i wouldn   have plucked it off  god bless my soul  to
save my life  as to measuring her waist in sport  as they
did  bold young brood  i couldn   have done it  i should
have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment 
and never come straight again  and yet i should
have dearly liked  i own  to have touched her lips  to have
questioned her  that she might have opened them  to have
looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes  and never
raised a blush  to have let loose waves of hair  an inch of
which would be a keepsake beyond price  in short  i should
have liked  i do confess  to have had the lightest licence
of a child  and yet to have been man enough to know its
value 

but now a knocking at the door was heard  and such a
rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed
and boisterous group  just in time to greet the father  who
came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys
and presents  then the shouting and the struggling  and
the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter 
the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his
pockets  despoil him of brown paper parcels  hold on tight
by his cravat  hug him round his neck  pommel his back 
and kick his legs in irrepressible affection  the shouts of
wonder and delight with which the development of every
package was received  the terrible announcement that the
baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll   frying pan
into his mouth  and was more than suspected of having
swallowed a fictitious turkey  glued on a wooden platter 
the immense relief of finding this a false alarm  the joy 
and gratitude  and ecstasy  they are all indescribable alike 
it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions
got out of the parlour  and by one stair at a time  up to the
top of the house  where they went to bed  and so subsided 

and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever 
when the master of the house  having his daughter leaning
fondly on him  sat down with her and her mother at his
own fireside  and when he thought that such another
creature  quite as graceful and as full of promise  might
have called him father  and been a spring time in the
haggard winter of his life  his sight grew very dim indeed 

 belle   said the husband  turning to his wife with a
smile   i saw an old friend of yours this afternoon  

 who was it  

 guess  

 how can i  tut  don   i know   she added in the
same breath  laughing as he laughed   mr  scrooge  

 mr  scrooge it was  i passed his office window  and as
it was not shut up  and he had a candle inside  i could
scarcely help seeing him  his partner lies upon the point
of death  i hear  and there he sat alone  quite alone in
the world  i do believe  

 spirit   said scrooge in a broken voice   remove me
from this place  

 i told you these were shadows of the things that have
been   said the ghost   that they are what they are  do
not blame me  

 remove me   scrooge exclaimed   i cannot bear it  

he turned upon the ghost  and seeing that it looked upon
him with a face  in which in some strange way there were
fragments of all the faces it had shown him  wrestled with it 

 leave me  take me back  haunt me no longer  

in the struggle  if that can be called a struggle in which
the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was
undisturbed by any effort of its adversary  scrooge observed
that its light was burning high and bright  and dimly
connecting that with its influence over him  he seized the
extinguisher cap  and by a sudden action pressed it down
upon its head 

the spirit dropped beneath it  so that the extinguisher
covered its whole form  but though scrooge pressed it down
with all his force  he could not hide the light  which streamed
from under it  in an unbroken flood upon the ground 

he was conscious of being exhausted  and overcome by an
irresistible drowsiness  and  further  of being in his own
bedroom   he gave the cap a parting squeeze  in which his hand
relaxed  and had barely time to reel to bed  before he sank
into a heavy sleep 


stave iii   the second of the three spirits

awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore  and
sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together  scrooge had
no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the
stroke of one  he felt that he was restored to consciousness
in the right nick of time  for the especial purpose of holding
a conference with the second messenger despatched to him
through jacob marley   intervention  but finding that he
turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which
of his curtains this new spectre would draw back  he put
them every one aside with his own hands  and lying down
again  established a sharp look out all round the bed  for
he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its
appearance  and did not wish to be taken by surprise  and
made nervous 

gentlemen of the free and easy sort  who plume themselves
on being acquainted with a move or two  and being usually
equal to the time of day  express the wide range of their
capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for
anything from pitch and toss to manslaughter  between which
opposite extremes  no doubt  there lies a tolerably wide and
comprehensive range of subjects  without venturing for
scrooge quite as hardily as this  i don   mind calling on you
to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of
strange appearances  and that nothing between a baby and
rhinoceros would have astonished him very much 

now  being prepared for almost anything  he was not by
any means prepared for nothing  and  consequently  when the
bell struck one  and no shape appeared  he was taken with a
violent fit of trembling  five minutes  ten minutes  a quarter
of an hour went by  yet nothing came  all this time  he lay
upon his bed  the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy
light  which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the
hour  and which  being only light  was more alarming than
a dozen ghosts  as he was powerless to make out what it
meant  or would be at  and was sometimes apprehensive
that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of
spontaneous combustion  without having the consolation of
knowing it  at last  however  he began to think  as you or
i would have thought at first  for it is always the person not
in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done
in it  and would unquestionably have done it too  at last  i
say  he began to think that the source and secret of this
ghostly light might be in the adjoining room  from whence 
on further tracing it  it seemed to shine  this idea taking
full possession of his mind  he got up softly and shuffled in
his slippers to the door 

the moment scrooge   hand was on the lock  a strange
voice called him by his name  and bade him enter  he
obeyed 

it was his own room  there was no doubt about that 
but it had undergone a surprising transformation  the walls
and ceiling were so hung with living green  that it looked a
perfect grove  from every part of which  bright gleaming
berries glistened  the crisp leaves of holly  mistletoe  and
ivy reflected back the light  as if so many little mirrors had
been scattered there  and such a mighty blaze went roaring
up the chimney  as that dull petrification of a hearth had
never known in scrooge   time  or marley    or for many and
many a winter season gone  heaped up on the floor  to form
a kind of throne  were turkeys  geese  game  poultry  brawn 
great joints of meat  sucking pigs  long wreaths of sausages 
mince pies  plum puddings  barrels of oysters  red hot chestnuts 
cherry cheeked apples  juicy oranges  luscious pears 
immense twelfth cakes  and seething bowls of punch  that
made the chamber dim with their delicious steam  in easy
state upon this couch  there sat a jolly giant  glorious to
see  who bore a glowing torch  in shape not unlike plenty  
horn  and held it up  high up  to shed its light on scrooge 
as he came peeping round the door 

 come in   exclaimed the ghost   come in  and know
me better  man  

scrooge entered timidly  and hung his head before this
spirit  he was not the dogged scrooge he had been  and
though the spirit   eyes were clear and kind  he did not like
to meet them 

 i am the ghost of christmas present   said the spirit 
 look upon me  

scrooge reverently did so  it was clothed in one simple
green robe  or mantle  bordered with white fur  this garment
hung so loosely on the figure  that its capacious breast was
bare  as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any
artifice  its feet  observable beneath the ample folds of the
garment  were also bare  and on its head it wore no other
covering than a holly wreath  set here and there with shining
icicles  its dark brown curls were long and free  free as its
genial face  its sparkling eye  its open hand  its cheery voice 
its unconstrained demeanour  and its joyful air  girded
round its middle was an antique scabbard  but no sword
was in it  and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust 

 you have never seen the like of me before   exclaimed
the spirit 

 never   scrooge made answer to it 

 have never walked forth with the younger members of
my family  meaning  for i am very young  my elder brothers
born in these later years   pursued the phantom 

 i don   think i have   said scrooge   i am afraid i have
not  have you had many brothers  spirit  

 more than eighteen hundred   said the ghost 

 a tremendous family to provide for   muttered scrooge 

the ghost of christmas present rose 

 spirit   said scrooge submissively   conduct me where
you will  i went forth last night on compulsion  and i learnt
a lesson which is working now  to night  if you have aught
to teach me  let me profit by it  

 touch my robe  

scrooge did as he was told  and held it fast 

holly  mistletoe  red berries  ivy  turkeys  geese  game 
poultry  brawn  meat  pigs  sausages  oysters  pies  puddings 
fruit  and punch  all vanished instantly  so did the room 
the fire  the ruddy glow  the hour of night  and they stood
in the city streets on christmas morning  where  for the
weather was severe  the people made a rough  but brisk and
not unpleasant kind of music  in scraping the snow from the
pavement in front of their dwellings  and from the tops of
their houses  whence it was mad delight to the boys to see
it come plumping down into the road below  and splitting
into artificial little snow storms 

the house fronts looked black enough  and the windows
blacker  contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow
upon the roofs  and with the dirtier snow upon the ground 
which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by
the heavy wheels of carts and waggons  furrows that crossed
and re crossed each other hundreds of times where the great
streets branched off  and made intricate channels  hard to trace
in the thick yellow mud and icy water  the sky was gloomy 
and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist 
half thawed  half frozen  whose heavier particles descended
in a shower of sooty atoms  as if all the chimneys in great
britain had  by one consent  caught fire  and were blazing away
to their dear hearts  content  there was nothing very cheerful
in the climate or the town  and yet was there an air of
cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest
summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain 

for  the people who were shovelling away on the housetops
were jovial and full of glee  calling out to one another
from the parapets  and now and then exchanging a facetious
snowball  better natured missile far than many a wordy jest  
laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it
went wrong  the poulterers  shops were still half open  and the
fruiterers  were radiant in their glory  there were great  round 
pot bellied baskets of chestnuts  shaped like the waistcoats
of jolly old gentlemen  lolling at the doors  and tumbling out
into the street in their apoplectic opulence  there were
ruddy  brown faced  broad girthed spanish onions  shining in
the fatness of their growth like spanish friars  and winking
from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went
by  and glanced demurely at the hung up mistletoe  there were
pears and apples  clustered high in blooming pyramids  there
were bunches of grapes  made  in the shopkeepers  benevolence
to dangle from conspicuous hooks  that people   mouths might
water gratis as they passed  there were piles of filberts  mossy
and brown  recalling  in their fragrance  ancient walks among
the woods  and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered
leaves  there were norfolk biffins  squat and swarthy  setting
off the yellow of the oranges and lemons  and  in the great
compactness of their juicy persons  urgently entreating and
beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after
dinner  the very gold and silver fish  set forth among
these choice fruits in a bowl  though members of a dull and
stagnant blooded race  appeared to know that there was
something going on  and  to a fish  went gasping round and
round their little world in slow and passionless excitement 

the grocers   oh  the grocers   nearly closed  with perhaps
two shutters down  or one  but through those gaps such
glimpses  it was not alone that the scales descending on the
counter made a merry sound  or that the twine and roller
parted company so briskly  or that the canisters were rattled
up and down like juggling tricks  or even that the blended
scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose  or even
that the raisins were so plentiful and rare  the almonds so
extremely white  the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight 
the other spices so delicious  the candied fruits so caked and
spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers on
feel faint and subsequently bilious  nor was it that the figs
were moist and pulpy  or that the french plums blushed in
modest tartness from their highly decorated boxes  or that
everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress  but
the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful
promise of the day  that they tumbled up against each other
at the door  crashing their wicker baskets wildly  and left
their purchases upon the counter  and came running back to
fetch them  and committed hundreds of the like mistakes  in
the best humour possible  while the grocer and his people
were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which
they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own 
worn outside for general inspection  and for christmas daws
to peck at if they chose 

but soon the steeples called good people all  to church and
chapel  and away they came  flocking through the streets in
their best clothes  and with their gayest faces  and at the
same time there emerged from scores of bye streets  lanes  and
nameless turnings  innumerable people  carrying their dinners
to the bakers  shops  the sight of these poor revellers
appeared to interest the spirit very much  for he stood with
scrooge beside him in a baker   doorway  and taking off the
covers as their bearers passed  sprinkled incense on their
dinners from his torch  and it was a very uncommon kind
of torch  for once or twice when there were angry words
between some dinner carriers who had jostled each other  he
shed a few drops of water on them from it  and their good
humour was restored directly  for they said  it was a shame
to quarrel upon christmas day  and so it was  god love
it  so it was 

in time the bells ceased  and the bakers were shut up  and
yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners
and the progress of their cooking  in the thawed blotch of
wet above each baker   oven  where the pavement smoked as
if its stones were cooking too 

 is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from
your torch   asked scrooge 

 there is  my own  

 would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day  
asked scrooge 

 to any kindly given  to a poor one most  

 why to a poor one most   asked scrooge 

 because it needs it most  

 spirit   said scrooge  after a moment   thought   i wonder
you  of all the beings in the many worlds about us  should
desire to cramp these people   opportunities of innocent
enjoyment  

 i   cried the spirit 

 you would deprive them of their means of dining every
seventh day  often the only day on which they can be said
to dine at all   said scrooge   wouldn   you  

 i   cried the spirit 

 you seek to close these places on the seventh day   said
scrooge   and it comes to the same thing  

 i seek   exclaimed the spirit 

 forgive me if i am wrong  it has been done in your
name  or at least in that of your family   said scrooge 

 there are some upon this earth of yours   returned the spirit 
 who lay claim to know us  and who do their deeds of passion 
pride  ill will  hatred  envy  bigotry  and selfishness
in our name  who are as strange to us and all our kith and
kin  as if they had never lived  remember that  and charge
their doings on themselves  not us  

scrooge promised that he would  and they went on 
invisible  as they had been before  into the suburbs of the
town  it was a remarkable quality of the ghost  which
scrooge had observed at the baker     that notwithstanding
his gigantic size  he could accommodate himself to any place
with ease  and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature  as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall 

and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in
showing off this power of his  or else it was his own kind 
generous  hearty nature  and his sympathy with all poor
men  that led him straight to scrooge   clerk    for there he
went  and took scrooge with him  holding to his robe  and
on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled  and stopped
to bless bob cratchit   dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch  think of that  bob had but fifteen  bob  a week
himself  he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his
christian name  and yet the ghost of christmas present
blessed his four roomed house 

then up rose mrs  cratchit  cratchit   wife  dressed out
but poorly in a twice turned gown  but brave in ribbons 
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence  and
she laid the cloth  assisted by belinda cratchit  second of
her daughters  also brave in ribbons  while master peter
cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes  and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar  bob   private
property  conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the
day  into his mouth  rejoiced to find himself so gallantly
attired  and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks 
and now two smaller cratchits  boy and girl  came tearing
in  screaming that outside the baker   they had smelt the
goose  and known it for their own  and basking in luxurious
thoughts of sage and onion  these young cratchits danced
about the table  and exalted master peter cratchit to the
skies  while he  not proud  although his collars nearly choked
him  blew the fire  until the slow potatoes bubbling up 
knocked loudly at the saucepan lid to be let out and
peeled 

 what has ever got your precious father then   said mrs 
cratchit   and your brother  tiny tim  and martha
warn   as late last christmas day by half an hour  

 here   martha  mother   said a girl  appearing as she
spoke 

 here   martha  mother   cried the two young cratchits 
 hurrah  there   such a goose  martha  

 why  bless your heart alive  my dear  how late you are  
said mrs  cratchit  kissing her a dozen times  and taking off
her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal 

 we   a deal of work to finish up last night   replied the
girl   and had to clear away this morning  mother  

 well  never mind so long as you are come   said mrs 
cratchit   sit ye down before the fire  my dear  and have
a warm  lord bless ye  

 no  no  there   father coming   cried the two young
cratchits  who were everywhere at once   hide  martha 
hide  

so martha hid herself  and in came little bob  the father 
with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe 
hanging down before him  and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed  to look seasonable  and tiny tim upon his
shoulder  alas for tiny tim  he bore a little crutch  and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame 

 why  where   our martha   cried bob cratchit  looking
round 

 not coming   said mrs  cratchit 

 not coming   said bob  with a sudden declension in his
high spirits  for he had been tim   blood horse all the way
from church  and had come home rampant   not coming
upon christmas day  

martha didn   like to see him disappointed  if it were only
in joke  so she came out prematurely from behind the closet
door  and ran into his arms  while the two young cratchits
hustled tiny tim  and bore him off into the wash house 
that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper 

 and how did little tim behave   asked mrs  cratchit 
when she had rallied bob on his credulity  and bob had
hugged his daughter to his heart   content 

 as good as gold   said bob   and better  somehow he
gets thoughtful  sitting by himself so much  and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard  he told me  coming home 
that he hoped the people saw him in the church  because he
was a cripple  and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon christmas day  who made lame beggars walk  and blind
men see  

bob   voice was tremulous when he told them this  and
trembled more when he said that tiny tim was growing
strong and hearty 

his active little crutch was heard upon the floor  and back
came tiny tim before another word was spoken  escorted by
his brother and sister to his stool before the fire  and while
bob  turning up his cuffs  as if  poor fellow  they were
capable of being made more shabby  compounded some hot
mixture in a jug with gin and lemons  and stirred it round
and round and put it on the hob to simmer  master peter 
and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the
goose  with which they soon returned in high procession 

such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose
the rarest of all birds  a feathered phenomenon  to which a
black swan was a matter of course  and in truth it was
something very like it in that house  mrs  cratchit made
the gravy  ready beforehand in a little saucepan  hissing hot 
master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour 
miss belinda sweetened up the apple sauce  martha dusted
the hot plates  bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table  the two young cratchits set chairs for
everybody  not forgetting themselves  and mounting guard
upon their posts  crammed spoons into their mouths  lest
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped  at last the dishes were set on  and grace was
said  it was succeeded by a breathless pause  as mrs 
cratchit  looking slowly all along the carving knife  prepared
to plunge it in the breast  but when she did  and when the
long expected gush of stuffing issued forth  one murmur of
delight arose all round the board  and even tiny tim 
excited by the two young cratchits  beat on the table with
the handle of his knife  and feebly cried hurrah 

there never was such a goose  bob said he didn   believe
there ever was such a goose cooked  its tenderness and
flavour  size and cheapness  were the themes of universal
admiration  eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes 
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family  indeed  as
mrs  cratchit said with great delight  surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish   they hadn   ate it all at
last  yet every one had had enough  and the youngest
cratchits in particular  were steeped in sage and onion to
the eyebrows  but now  the plates being changed by miss
belinda  mrs  cratchit left the room alone  too nervous to
bear witnesses  to take the pudding up and bring it in 

suppose it should not be done enough  suppose it should
break in turning out  suppose somebody should have got
over the wall of the back yard  and stolen it  while they
were merry with the goose  a supposition at which the two
young cratchits became livid  all sorts of horrors were
supposed 

hallo  a great deal of steam  the pudding was out of
the copper  a smell like a washing day  that was the
cloth  a smell like an eating house and a pastrycook   next
door to each other  with a laundress   next door to that 
that was the pudding  in half a minute mrs  cratchit
entered  flushed  but smiling proudly  with the pudding 
like a speckled cannon ball  so hard and firm  blazing in half
of half a quartern of ignited brandy  and bedight with
christmas holly stuck into the top 

oh  a wonderful pudding  bob cratchit said  and calmly
too  that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
mrs  cratchit since their marriage  mrs  cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind  she would confess she had
had her doubts about the quantity of flour  everybody had
something to say about it  but nobody said or thought it
was at all a small pudding for a large family  it would have
been flat heresy to do so  any cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing 

at last the dinner was all done  the cloth was cleared  the
hearth swept  and the fire made up  the compound in the
jug being tasted  and considered perfect  apples and oranges
were put upon the table  and a shovel full of chestnuts on the
fire  then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth  in
what bob cratchit called a circle  meaning half a one  and
at bob cratchit   elbow stood the family display of glass 
two tumblers  and a custard cup without a handle 

these held the hot stuff from the jug  however  as well as
golden goblets would have done  and bob served it out with
beaming looks  while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and
cracked noisily  then bob proposed 

 a merry christmas to us all  my dears  god bless us  

which all the family re echoed 

 god bless us every one   said tiny tim  the last of all 

he sat very close to his father   side upon his little
stool  bob held his withered little hand in his  as if he
loved the child  and wished to keep him by his side  and
dreaded that he might be taken from him 

 spirit   said scrooge  with an interest he had never felt
before   tell me if tiny tim will live  

 i see a vacant seat   replied the ghost   in the poor
chimney corner  and a crutch without an owner  carefully
preserved  if these shadows remain unaltered by the future 
the child will die  

 no  no   said scrooge   oh  no  kind spirit  say he
will be spared  

 if these shadows remain unaltered by the future  none
other of my race   returned the ghost   will find him here 
what then  if he be like to die  he had better do it  and
decrease the surplus population  

scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by
the spirit  and was overcome with penitence and grief 

 man   said the ghost   if man you be in heart  not
adamant  forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered
what the surplus is  and where it is  will you decide what
men shall live  what men shall die  it may be  that in the
sight of heaven  you are more worthless and less fit to live
than millions like this poor man   child  oh god  to hear
the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life
among his hungry brothers in the dust  

scrooge bent before the ghost   rebuke  and trembling cast
his eyes upon the ground  but he raised them speedily  on
hearing his own name 

 mr  scrooge   said bob   i ll give you mr  scrooge  the
founder of the feast  

 the founder of the feast indeed   cried mrs  cratchit 
reddening   i wish i had him here  i   give him a piece
of my mind to feast upon  and i hope he   have a good
appetite for it  

 my dear   said bob   the children  christmas day  

 it should be christmas day  i am sure   said she   on
which one drinks the health of such an odious  stingy  hard 
unfeeling man as mr  scrooge  you know he is  robert 
nobody knows it better than you do  poor fellow  

 my dear   was bob   mild answer   christmas day  

 i ll drink his health for your sake and the day     said
mrs  cratchit   not for his  long life to him  a merry
christmas and a happy new year  he ll be very merry and
very happy  i have no doubt  

the children drank the toast after her  it was the first of
their proceedings which had no heartiness  tiny tim drank
it last of all  but he didn   care twopence for it  scrooge
was the ogre of the family  the mention of his name cast
a dark shadow on the party  which was not dispelled for full
five minutes 

after it had passed away  they were ten times merrier than
before  from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done
with  bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for master peter  which would bring in  if obtained  full
five and sixpence weekly  the two young cratchits laughed
tremendously at the idea of peter   being a man of business 
and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars  as if he were deliberating what particular
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt
of that bewildering income  martha  who was a poor
apprentice at a milliner    then told them what kind of work
she had to do  and how many hours she worked at a stretch 
and how she meant to lie abed to morrow morning for a
good long rest  to morrow being a holiday she passed at
home  also how she had seen a countess and a lord some
days before  and how the lord  was much about as tall as
peter   at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you
couldn   have seen his head if you had been there  all this
time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round  and
by and bye they had a song  about a lost child travelling in
the snow  from tiny tim  who had a plaintive little voice 
and sang it very well indeed 

there was nothing of high mark in this  they were not
a handsome family  they were not well dressed  their shoes
were far from being water proof  their clothes were scanty 
and peter might have known  and very likely did  the inside
of a pawnbroker    but  they were happy  grateful  pleased
with one another  and contented with the time  and when
they faded  and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings
of the spirit   torch at parting  scrooge had his eye upon
them  and especially on tiny tim  until the last 

by this time it was getting dark  and snowing pretty
heavily  and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets 
the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens  parlours  and
all sorts of rooms  was wonderful  here  the flickering of
the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner  with hot
plates baking through and through before the fire  and deep
red curtains  ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness 
there all the children of the house were running out
into the snow to meet their married sisters  brothers  cousins 
uncles  aunts  and be the first to greet them  here  again 
were shadows on the window blind of guests assembling  and
there a group of handsome girls  all hooded and fur booted 
and all chattering at once  tripped lightly off to some near
neighbour   house  where  woe upon the single man who saw
them enter  artful witches  well they knew it  in a glow 

but  if you had judged from the numbers of people on
their way to friendly gatherings  you might have thought
that no one was at home to give them welcome when they
got there  instead of every house expecting company  and
piling up its fires half chimney high  blessings on it  how
the ghost exulted  how it bared its breadth of breast  and
opened its capacious palm  and floated on  outpouring  with
a generous hand  its bright and harmless mirth on everything
within its reach  the very lamplighter  who ran on before 
dotting the dusky street with specks of light  and who was
dressed to spend the evening somewhere  laughed out loudly
as the spirit passed  though little kenned the lamplighter
that he had any company but christmas 

and now  without a word of warning from the ghost  they
stood upon a bleak and desert moor  where monstrous masses
of rude stone were cast about  as though it were the burial place
of giants  and water spread itself wheresoever it listed 
or would have done so  but for the frost that held it prisoner 
and nothing grew but moss and furze  and coarse rank grass 
down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery
red  which glared upon the desolation for an instant  like a
sullen eye  and frowning lower  lower  lower yet  was lost in
the thick gloom of darkest night 

 what place is this   asked scrooge 

 a place where miners live  who labour in the bowels of
the earth   returned the spirit   but they know me  see  

a light shone from the window of a hut  and swiftly they
advanced towards it  passing through the wall of mud and
stone  they found a cheerful company assembled round a
glowing fire  an old  old man and woman  with their
children and their children   children  and another generation
beyond that  all decked out gaily in their holiday attire 
the old man  in a voice that seldom rose above the howling
of the wind upon the barren waste  was singing them a
christmas song  it had been a very old song when he was a
boy  and from time to time they all joined in the chorus 
so surely as they raised their voices  the old man got quite
blithe and loud  and so surely as they stopped  his vigour
sank again 

the spirit did not tarry here  but bade scrooge hold his
robe  and passing on above the moor  sped  whither  not
to sea  to sea  to scrooge   horror  looking back  he saw
the last of the land  a frightful range of rocks  behind them 
and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water  as it
rolled and roared  and raged among the dreadful caverns it
had worn  and fiercely tried to undermine the earth 

built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks  some league
or so from shore  on which the waters chafed and dashed 
the wild year through  there stood a solitary lighthouse 
great heaps of sea weed clung to its base  and storm birds
  born of the wind one might suppose  as sea weed of the
water  rose and fell about it  like the waves they skimmed 

but even here  two men who watched the light had made
a fire  that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed
out a ray of brightness on the awful sea  joining their
horny hands over the rough table at which they sat  they
wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog  and
one of them  the elder  too  with his face all damaged and
scarred with hard weather  as the figure head of an old ship
might be  struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in
itself 

again the ghost sped on  above the black and heaving sea
  on  on  until  being far away  as he told scrooge  from any
shore  they lighted on a ship  they stood beside the helmsman
at the wheel  the look out in the bow  the officers who
had the watch  dark  ghostly figures in their several stations 
but every man among them hummed a christmas tune  or
had a christmas thought  or spoke below his breath to his
companion of some bygone christmas day  with homeward
hopes belonging to it  and every man on board  waking or
sleeping  good or bad  had had a kinder word for another
on that day than on any day in the year  and had shared
to some extent in its festivities  and had remembered those
he cared for at a distance  and had known that they delighted
to remember him 

it was a great surprise to scrooge  while listening to the
moaning of the wind  and thinking what a solemn thing it
was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown
abyss  whose depths were secrets as profound as death  it
was a great surprise to scrooge  while thus engaged  to hear
a hearty laugh  it was a much greater surprise to scrooge
to recognise it as his own nephew   and to find himself in a
bright  dry  gleaming room  with the spirit standing smiling
by his side  and looking at that same nephew with approving
affability 

 ha  ha   laughed scrooge   nephew   ha  ha  ha  

if you should happen  by any unlikely chance  to know a
man more blest in a laugh than scrooge   nephew  all i can
say is  i should like to know him too  introduce him to me 
and i ll cultivate his acquaintance 

it is a fair  even handed  noble adjustment of things  that
while there is infection in disease and sorrow  there is nothing
in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and
good humour  when scrooge   nephew laughed in this way  holding
his sides  rolling his head  and twisting his face into the
most extravagant contortions  scrooge   niece  by marriage 
laughed as heartily as he  and their assembled friends being
not a bit behindhand  roared out lustily 

 ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  ha  

 he said that christmas was a humbug  as i live   cried
scrooge   nephew   he believed it too  

 more shame for him  fred   said scrooge   niece 
indignantly  bless those women  they never do anything by
halves  they are always in earnest 

she was very pretty  exceedingly pretty  with a dimpled 
surprised looking  capital face  a ripe little mouth  that
seemed made to be kissed  as no doubt it was  all kinds of
good little dots about her chin  that melted into one another
when she laughed  and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever
saw in any little creature   head  altogether she was what
you would have called provoking  you know  but satisfactory  too 
oh  perfectly satisfactory 

 he   a comical old fellow   said scrooge   nephew   that  
the truth  and not so pleasant as he might be  however 
his offences carry their own punishment  and i have nothing
to say against him  

 i   sure he is very rich  fred   hinted scrooge   niece 
 at least you always tell me so  

 what of that  my dear   said scrooge   nephew   his
wealth is of no use to him  he don   do any good with it 
he don   make himself comfortable with it  he hasn   the
satisfaction of thinking  ha  ha  ha   that he is ever going
to benefit us with it  

 i have no patience with him   observed scrooge   niece 
scrooge   niece   sisters  and all the other ladies  expressed
the same opinion 

 oh  i have   said scrooge   nephew   i am sorry for
him  i couldn   be angry with him if i tried  who suffers
by his ill whims  himself  always  here  he takes it into
his head to dislike us  and he won   come and dine with us 
what   the consequence  he don   lose much of a dinner  

 indeed  i think he loses a very good dinner   interrupted
scrooge   niece  everybody else said the same  and they
must be allowed to have been competent judges  because
they had just had dinner  and  with the dessert upon the
table  were clustered round the fire  by lamplight 

 well  i   very glad to hear it   said scrooge   nephew 
 because i haven   great faith in these young housekeepers 
what do you say  topper  

topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooge   niece  
sisters  for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast 
who had no right to express an opinion on the subject 
whereat scrooge   niece   sister  the plump one with the lace
tucker  not the one with the roses  blushed 

 do go on  fred   said scrooge   niece  clapping her hands 
 he never finishes what he begins to say  he is such a
ridiculous fellow  

scrooge   nephew revelled in another laugh  and as it was
impossible to keep the infection off  though the plump sister
tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar  his example was
unanimously followed 

 i was only going to say   said scrooge   nephew   that
the consequence of his taking a dislike to us  and not making
merry with us  is  as i think  that he loses some pleasant
moments  which could do him no harm  i am sure he loses
pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts 
either in his mouldy old office  or his dusty chambers  i
mean to give him the same chance every year  whether he
likes it or not  for i pity him  he may rail at christmas
till he dies  but he can   help thinking better of it  i defy
him  if he finds me going there  in good temper  year after
year  and saying uncle scrooge  how are you  if it only
puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds 
that   something  and i think i shook him yesterday  

it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking
scrooge  but being thoroughly good natured  and not much
caring what they laughed at  so that they laughed at any
rate  he encouraged them in their merriment  and passed the
bottle joyously 

after tea  they had some music  for they were a musical
family  and knew what they were about  when they sung a
glee or catch  i can assure you  especially topper  who
could growl away in the bass like a good one  and never
swell the large veins in his forehead  or get red in the face
over it  scrooge   niece played well upon the harp  and
played among other tunes a simple little air  a mere nothing 
you might learn to whistle it in two minutes   which had
been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the
boarding school  as he had been reminded by the ghost of
christmas past  when this strain of music sounded  all the
things that ghost had shown him  came upon his mind  he
softened more and more  and thought that if he could have
listened to it often  years ago  he might have cultivated the
kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands 
without resorting to the sexton   spade that buried jacob
marley 

but they didn   devote the whole evening to music  after
a while they played at forfeits  for it is good to be children
sometimes  and never better than at christmas  when its
mighty founder was a child himself  stop  there was first
a game at blind man   buff  of course there was  and i
no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he
had eyes in his boots  my opinion is  that it was a done
thing between him and scrooge   nephew  and that the
ghost of christmas present knew it  the way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker  was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature  knocking down the fire irons 
tumbling over the chairs  bumping against the piano 
smothering himself among the curtains  wherever she went 
there went he  he always knew where the plump sister was 
he wouldn   catch anybody else  if you had fallen up
against him  as some of them did   on purpose  he would
have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you  which would
have been an affront to your understanding  and would instantly
have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister 
she often cried out that it wasn   fair  and it really was not 
but when at last  he caught her  when  in spite of all her
silken rustlings  and her rapid flutterings past him  he got
her into a corner whence there was no escape  then his
conduct was the most execrable  for his pretending not to
know her  his pretending that it was necessary to touch her
head dress  and further to assure himself of her identity by
pressing a certain ring upon her finger  and a certain chain
about her neck  was vile  monstrous  no doubt she told
him her opinion of it  when  another blind man being in
office  they were so very confidential together  behind the
curtains 

scrooge   niece was not one of the blind man   buff party 
but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool 
in a snug corner  where the ghost and scrooge were close
behind her  but she joined in the forfeits  and loved her
love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet 
likewise at the game of how  when  and where  she was
very great  and to the secret joy of scrooge   nephew  beat
her sisters hollow  though they were sharp girls too  as topper
could have told you  there might have been twenty people there 
young and old  but they all played  and so did scrooge  for
wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on  that
his voice made no sound in their ears  he sometimes came out with
his guess quite loud  and very often guessed quite right  too 
for the sharpest needle  best whitechapel  warranted not to cut
in the eye  was not sharper than scrooge  blunt as he took it in
his head to be 

the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood 
and looked upon him with such favour  that he begged like
a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed  but
this the spirit said could not be done 

 here is a new game   said scrooge   one half hour 
spirit  only one  

it was a game called yes and no  where scrooge   nephew
had to think of something  and the rest must find out what 
he only answering to their questions yes or no  as the case
was  the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed 
elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal  a live
animal  rather a disagreeable animal  a savage animal  an
animal that growled and grunted sometimes  and talked sometimes 
and lived in london  and walked about the streets 
and wasn   made a show of  and wasn   led by anybody  and
didn   live in a menagerie  and was never killed in a market 
and was not a horse  or an ass  or a cow  or a bull  or a
tiger  or a dog  or a pig  or a cat  or a bear  at every fresh
question that was put to him  this nephew burst into a
fresh roar of laughter  and was so inexpressibly tickled  that
he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp  at last
the plump sister  falling into a similar state  cried out 

 i have found it out  i know what it is  fred  i know
what it is  

 what is it   cried fred 

 it   your uncle scro o o o oge  

which it certainly was  admiration was the universal
sentiment  though some objected that the reply to  is it a
bear   ought to have been  yes   inasmuch as an answer
in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts
from mr  scrooge  supposing they had ever had any tendency
that way 

 he has given us plenty of merriment  i am sure   said
fred   and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health 
here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the
moment  and i say   uncle scrooge   

 well  uncle scrooge   they cried 

 a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old
man  whatever he is   said scrooge   nephew   he wouldn  
take it from me  but may he have it  nevertheless  uncle
scrooge  

uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light
of heart  that he would have pledged the unconscious
company in return  and thanked them in an inaudible speech 
if the ghost had given him time  but the whole scene
passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his
nephew  and he and the spirit were again upon their travels 

much they saw  and far they went  and many homes they
visited  but always with a happy end  the spirit stood
beside sick beds  and they were cheerful  on foreign lands 
and they were close at home  by struggling men  and they
were patient in their greater hope  by poverty  and it was
rich  in almshouse  hospital  and jail  in misery   every
refuge  where vain man in his little brief authority had not
made fast the door  and barred the spirit out  he left his
blessing  and taught scrooge his precepts 

it was a long night  if it were only a night  but scrooge
had his doubts of this  because the christmas holidays appeared
to be condensed into the space of time they passed
together  it was strange  too  that while scrooge remained
unaltered in his outward form  the ghost grew older  clearly
older  scrooge had observed this change  but never spoke of
it  until they left a children   twelfth night party  when 
looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place 
he noticed that its hair was grey 

 are spirits  lives so short   asked scrooge 

 my life upon this globe  is very brief   replied the ghost 
 it ends to night  

 to night   cried scrooge 

 to night at midnight  hark  the time is drawing
near  

the chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at
that moment 

 forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask   said
scrooge  looking intently at the spirit   robe   but i see
something strange  and not belonging to yourself  protruding
from your skirts  is it a foot or a claw  

 it might be a claw  for the flesh there is upon it   was
the spirit   sorrowful reply   look here  

from the foldings of its robe  it brought two children 
wretched  abject  frightful  hideous  miserable  they knelt
down at its feet  and clung upon the outside of its garment 

 oh  man  look here  look  look  down here   exclaimed
the ghost 

they were a boy and girl  yellow  meagre  ragged  scowling 
wolfish  but prostrate  too  in their humility  where
graceful youth should have filled their features out  and
touched them with its freshest tints  a stale and shrivelled
hand  like that of age  had pinched  and twisted them  and
pulled them into shreds  where angels might have sat
enthroned  devils lurked  and glared out menacing  no
change  no degradation  no perversion of humanity  in any
grade  through all the mysteries of wonderful creation  has
monsters half so horrible and dread 

scrooge started back  appalled  having them shown to
him in this way  he tried to say they were fine children  but
the words choked themselves  rather than be parties to a lie
of such enormous magnitude 

 spirit  are they yours   scrooge could say no more 

 they are man     said the spirit  looking down upon
them   and they cling to me  appealing from their fathers 
this boy is ignorance  this girl is want  beware them both 
and all of their degree  but most of all beware this boy  for
on his brow i see that written which is doom  unless the
writing be erased  deny it   cried the spirit  stretching out
its hand towards the city   slander those who tell it ye 
admit it for your factious purposes  and make it worse 
and bide the end  

 have they no refuge or resource   cried scrooge 

 are there no prisons   said the spirit  turning on him
for the last time with his own words   are there no workhouses  

the bell struck twelve 

scrooge looked about him for the ghost  and saw it not 
as the last stroke ceased to vibrate  he remembered the
prediction of old jacob marley  and lifting up his eyes 
beheld a solemn phantom  draped and hooded  coming  like
a mist along the ground  towards him 


stave iv   the last of the spirits

the phantom slowly  gravely  silently  approached  when
it came near him  scrooge bent down upon his knee  for in
the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to
scatter gloom and mystery 

it was shrouded in a deep black garment  which concealed
its head  its face  its form  and left nothing of it visible
save one outstretched hand  but for this it would have been
difficult to detach its figure from the night  and separate it
from the darkness by which it was surrounded 

he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside
him  and that its mysterious presence filled him with a
solemn dread  he knew no more  for the spirit neither
spoke nor moved 

 i am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to
come   said scrooge 

the spirit answered not  but pointed onward with its
hand 

 you are about to show me shadows of the things that
have not happened  but will happen in the time before us  
scrooge pursued   is that so  spirit  

the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
instant in its folds  as if the spirit had inclined its head 
that was the only answer he received 

although well used to ghostly company by this time 
scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled
beneath him  and he found that he could hardly stand when
he prepared to follow it  the spirit paused a moment  as
observing his condition  and giving him time to recover 

but scrooge was all the worse for this  it thrilled him
with a vague uncertain horror  to know that behind the
dusky shroud  there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
him  while he  though he stretched his own to the utmost 
could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
of black 

 ghost of the future   he exclaimed   i fear you more
than any spectre i have seen  but as i know your purpose
is to do me good  and as i hope to live to be another
man from what i was  i am prepared to bear you company 
and do it with a thankful heart  will you not speak
to me  

it gave him no reply  the hand was pointed straight
before them 

 lead on   said scrooge   lead on  the night is
waning fast  and it is precious time to me  i know  lead
on  spirit  

the phantom moved away as it had come towards him 
scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress  which bore him
up  he thought  and carried him along 

they scarcely seemed to enter the city  for the city rather
seemed to spring up about them  and encompass them of its
own act  but there they were  in the heart of it  on
 change  amongst the merchants  who hurried up and down 
and chinked the money in their pockets  and conversed in
groups  and looked at their watches  and trifled thoughtfully
with their great gold seals  and so forth  as scrooge had
seen them often 

the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men 
observing that the hand was pointed to them  scrooge
advanced to listen to their talk 

 no   said a great fat man with a monstrous chin   i
don   know much about it  either way  i only know he  
dead  

 when did he die   inquired another 

 last night  i believe  

 why  what was the matter with him   asked a third 
taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff box 
 i thought he   never die  

 god knows   said the first  with a yawn 

 what has he done with his money   asked a red faced
gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his
nose  that shook like the gills of a turkey cock 

 i haven   heard   said the man with the large chin 
yawning again   left it to his company  perhaps  he hasn  
left it to me  that   all i know  

this pleasantry was received with a general laugh 

 it   likely to be a very cheap funeral   said the same
speaker   for upon my life i don   know of anybody to go
to it  suppose we make up a party and volunteer  

 i don   mind going if a lunch is provided   observed the
gentleman with the excrescence on his nose   but i must
be fed  if i make one  

another laugh 

 well  i am the most disinterested among you  after all  
said the first speaker   for i never wear black gloves  and i
never eat lunch  but i ll offer to go  if anybody else will 
when i come to think of it  i   not at all sure that i wasn  
his most particular friend  for we used to stop and speak
whenever we met  bye  bye  

speakers and listeners strolled away  and mixed with
other groups  scrooge knew the men  and looked towards the
spirit for an explanation 

the phantom glided on into a street  its finger pointed
to two persons meeting  scrooge listened again  thinking
that the explanation might lie here 

he knew these men  also  perfectly  they were men of business 
very wealthy  and of great importance  he had made a point
always of standing well in their esteem  in a business point
of view  that is  strictly in a business point of view 

 how are you   said one 

 how are you   returned the other 

 well   said the first   old scratch has got his own at
last  hey  

 so i am told   returned the second   cold  isn   it  

 seasonable for christmas time  you re not a skater  i
suppose  

 no  no  something else to think of  good morning  

not another word  that was their meeting  their
conversation  and their parting 

scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the
spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so
trivial  but feeling assured that they must have some hidden
purpose  he set himself to consider what it was likely to be 
they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the
death of jacob  his old partner  for that was past  and this
ghost   province was the future  nor could he think of any
one immediately connected with himself  to whom he could
apply them  but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they
applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement 
he resolved to treasure up every word he heard 
and everything he saw  and especially to observe the
shadow of himself when it appeared  for he had an expectation
that the conduct of his future self would give him
the clue he missed  and would render the solution of these
riddles easy 

he looked about in that very place for his own image  but
another man stood in his accustomed corner  and though the
clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there  he
saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured
in through the porch  it gave him little surprise  however 
for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life  and
thought and hoped he saw his new born resolutions carried
out in this 

quiet and dark  beside him stood the phantom  with its
outstretched hand  when he roused himself from his
thoughtful quest  he fancied from the turn of the hand  and
its situation in reference to himself  that the unseen eyes
were looking at him keenly  it made him shudder  and feel
very cold 

they left the busy scene  and went into an obscure part
of the town  where scrooge had never penetrated before 
although he recognised its situation  and its bad repute  the
ways were foul and narrow  the shops and houses wretched 
the people half naked  drunken  slipshod  ugly  alleys and
archways  like so many cesspools  disgorged their offences of
smell  and dirt  and life  upon the straggling streets  and the
whole quarter reeked with crime  with filth  and misery 

far in this den of infamous resort  there was a low browed 
beetling shop  below a pent house roof  where iron  old rags 
bottles  bones  and greasy offal  were bought  upon the floor
within  were piled up heaps of rusty keys  nails  chains  hinges 
files  scales  weights  and refuse iron of all kinds  secrets
that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in
mountains of unseemly rags  masses of corrupted fat  and
sepulchres of bones  sitting in among the wares he dealt in  by a
charcoal stove  made of old bricks  was a grey haired rascal 
nearly seventy years of age  who had screened himself from the
cold air without  by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous
tatters  hung upon a line  and smoked his pipe in all the luxury
of calm retirement 

scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this
man  just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the
shop  but she had scarcely entered  when another woman 
similarly laden  came in too  and she was closely followed by
a man in faded black  who was no less startled by the sight
of them  than they had been upon the recognition of each
other  after a short period of blank astonishment  in which
the old man with the pipe had joined them  they all three
burst into a laugh 

 let the charwoman alone to be the first   cried she who
had entered first   let the laundress alone to be the second 
and let the undertaker   man alone to be the third  look
here  old joe  here   a chance  if we haven   all three met
here without meaning it  

 you couldn   have met in a better place   said old joe 
removing his pipe from his mouth   come into the parlour 
you were made free of it long ago  you know  and the other
two an   strangers  stop till i shut the door of the shop 
ah  how it skreeks  there an   such a rusty bit of metal
in the place as its own hinges  i believe  and i   sure there  
no such old bones here  as mine  ha  ha  we re all suitable
to our calling  we re well matched  come into the
parlour  come into the parlour  

the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags  the
old man raked the fire together with an old stair rod  and
having trimmed his smoky lamp  for it was night   with the
stem of his pipe  put it in his mouth again 

while he did this  the woman who had already spoken
threw her bundle on the floor  and sat down in a flaunting
manner on a stool  crossing her elbows on her knees  and
looking with a bold defiance at the other two 

 what odds then  what odds  mrs  dilber   said the
woman   every person has a right to take care of themselves 
he always did  

 that   true  indeed   said the laundress   no man
more so  

 why then  don   stand staring as if you was afraid 
woman  who   the wiser  we re not going to pick holes in
each other   coats  i suppose  

 no  indeed   said mrs  dilber and the man together 
 we should hope not  

 very well  then   cried the woman   that   enough 
who   the worse for the loss of a few things like these 
not a dead man  i suppose  

 no  indeed   said mrs  dilber  laughing 

 if he wanted to keep  em after he was dead  a wicked old
screw   pursued the woman   why wasn   he natural in his
lifetime  if he had been  he   have had somebody to look
after him when he was struck with death  instead of lying
gasping out his last there  alone by himself  

 it   the truest word that ever was spoke   said mrs 
dilber   it   a judgment on him  

 i wish it was a little heavier judgment   replied the
woman   and it should have been  you may depend upon it 
if i could have laid my hands on anything else  open that
bundle  old joe  and let me know the value of it  speak out
plain  i   not afraid to be the first  nor afraid for them to
see it  we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves 
before we met here  i believe  it   no sin  open the bundle 
joe  

but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this 
and the man in faded black  mounting the breach first 
produced his plunder  it was not extensive  a seal or two 
a pencil case  a pair of sleeve buttons  and a brooch of no
great value  were all  they were severally examined and
appraised by old joe  who chalked the sums he was disposed
to give for each  upon the wall  and added them up into a
total when he found there was nothing more to come 

 that   your account   said joe   and i wouldn   give
another sixpence  if i was to be boiled for not doing it 
who   next  

mrs  dilber was next  sheets and towels  a little wearing
apparel  two old fashioned silver teaspoons  a pair of
sugar tongs  and a few boots  her account was stated on the wall
in the same manner 

 i always give too much to ladies  it   a weakness of mine 
and that   the way i ruin myself   said old joe   that  
your account  if you asked me for another penny  and made
it an open question  i   repent of being so liberal and knock
off half a crown  

 and now undo my bundle  joe   said the first woman 

joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience
of opening it  and having unfastened a great many knots 
dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff 

 what do you call this   said joe   bed curtains  

 ah   returned the woman  laughing and leaning forward
on her crossed arms   bed curtains  

 you don   mean to say you took  em down  rings and
all  with him lying there   said joe 

 yes i do   replied the woman   why not  

 you were born to make your fortune   said joe   and
you ll certainly do it  

 i certainly shan   hold my hand  when i can get anything
in it by reaching it out  for the sake of such a man as he
was  i promise you  joe   returned the woman coolly   don  
drop that oil upon the blankets  now  

 his blankets   asked joe 

 whose else   do you think   replied the woman   he
isn   likely to take cold without  em  i dare say  

 i hope he didn   die of anything catching  eh   said
old joe  stopping in his work  and looking up 

 don   you be afraid of that   returned the woman   i
an   so fond of his company that i   loiter about him for
such things  if he did  ah  you may look through that
shirt till your eyes ache  but you won   find a hole in it  nor
a threadbare place  it   the best he had  and a fine one too 
they   have wasted it  if it hadn   been for me  

 what do you call wasting of it   asked old joe 

 putting it on him to be buried in  to be sure   replied
the woman with a laugh   somebody was fool enough to
do it  but i took it off again  if calico an   good enough for
such a purpose  it isn   good enough for anything  it   quite
as becoming to the body  he can   look uglier than he did
in that one  

scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror  as they sat
grouped about their spoil  in the scanty light afforded by
the old man   lamp  he viewed them with a detestation and
disgust  which could hardly have been greater  though they
had been obscene demons  marketing the corpse itself 

 ha  ha   laughed the same woman  when old joe 
producing a flannel bag with money in it  told out their
several gains upon the ground   this is the end of it  you
see  he frightened every one away from him when he was
alive  to profit us when he was dead  ha  ha  ha  

 spirit   said scrooge  shuddering from head to foot   i
see  i see  the case of this unhappy man might be my own 
my life tends that way  now  merciful heaven  what is
this  

he recoiled in terror  for the scene had changed  and now
he almost touched a bed  a bare  uncurtained bed  on which 
beneath a ragged sheet  there lay a something covered up 
which  though it was dumb  announced itself in awful
language 

the room was very dark  too dark to be observed with
any accuracy  though scrooge glanced round it in obedience
to a secret impulse  anxious to know what kind of room it
was  a pale light  rising in the outer air  fell straight upon
the bed  and on it  plundered and bereft  unwatched  unwept 
uncared for  was the body of this man 

scrooge glanced towards the phantom  its steady hand
was pointed to the head  the cover was so carelessly adjusted
that the slightest raising of it  the motion of a finger upon
scrooge   part  would have disclosed the face  he thought
of it  felt how easy it would be to do  and longed to do it 
but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss
the spectre at his side 

oh cold  cold  rigid  dreadful death  set up thine altar
here  and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy
command  for this is thy dominion  but of the loved 
revered  and honoured head  thou canst not turn one hair
to thy dread purposes  or make one feature odious  it is
not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released 
it is not that the heart and pulse are still  but that the
hand was open  generous  and true  the heart brave  warm 
and tender  and the pulse a man    strike  shadow  strike 
and see his good deeds springing from the wound  to sow
the world with life immortal 

no voice pronounced these words in scrooge   ears  and
yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed  he
thought  if this man could be raised up now  what would be
his foremost thoughts  avarice  hard dealing  griping cares 
they have brought him to a rich end  truly 

he lay  in the dark empty house  with not a man  a
woman  or a child  to say that he was kind to me in this
or that  and for the memory of one kind word i will be
kind to him  a cat was tearing at the door  and there was
a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth stone  what
they wanted in the room of death  and why they were so
restless and disturbed  scrooge did not dare to think 

 spirit   he said   this is a fearful place  in leaving it 
i shall not leave its lesson  trust me  let us go  

still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the
head 

 i understand you   scrooge returned   and i would do
it  if i could  but i have not the power  spirit  i have
not the power  

again it seemed to look upon him 

 if there is any person in the town  who feels emotion
caused by this man   death   said scrooge quite agonised 
 show that person to me  spirit  i beseech you  

the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a
moment  like a wing  and withdrawing it  revealed a room
by daylight  where a mother and her children were 

she was expecting some one  and with anxious eagerness 
for she walked up and down the room  started at every
sound  looked out from the window  glanced at the clock 
tried  but in vain  to work with her needle  and could hardly
bear the voices of the children in their play 

at length the long expected knock was heard  she hurried
to the door  and met her husband  a man whose face was
careworn and depressed  though he was young  there was
a remarkable expression in it now  a kind of serious delight
of which he felt ashamed  and which he struggled to repress 

he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for
him by the fire  and when she asked him faintly what news
 which was not until after a long silence   he appeared
embarrassed how to answer 

 is it good   she said   or bad    to help him 

 bad   he answered 

 we are quite ruined  

 no  there is hope yet  caroline  

 if he relents   she said  amazed   there is  nothing is
past hope  if such a miracle has happened  

 he is past relenting   said her husband   he is dead  

she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke
truth  but she was thankful in her soul to hear it  and she
said so  with clasped hands  she prayed forgiveness the next
moment  and was sorry  but the first was the emotion of
her heart 

 what the half drunken woman whom i told you of last
night  said to me  when i tried to see him and obtain a
week   delay  and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid
me  turns out to have been quite true  he was not only
very ill  but dying  then  

 to whom will our debt be transferred  

 i don   know  but before that time we shall be ready
with the money  and even though we were not  it would be
a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his
successor  we may sleep to night with light hearts  caroline  

yes  soften it as they would  their hearts were lighter 
the children   faces  hushed and clustered round to hear what
they so little understood  were brighter  and it was a happier
house for this man   death  the only emotion that the
ghost could show him  caused by the event  was one of
pleasure 

 let me see some tenderness connected with a death   said
scrooge   or that dark chamber  spirit  which we left just
now  will be for ever present to me  

the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet  and as they went along  scrooge looked here and
there to find himself  but nowhere was he to be seen  they
entered poor bob cratchit   house  the dwelling he had
visited before  and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire 

quiet  very quiet  the noisy little cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner  and sat looking up at peter 
who had a book before him  the mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing  but surely they were very quiet 

  and he took a child  and set him in the midst of
them   

where had scrooge heard those words  he had not
dreamed them  the boy must have read them out  as he
and the spirit crossed the threshold  why did he not
go on 

the mother laid her work upon the table  and put her
hand up to her face 

 the colour hurts my eyes   she said 

the colour  ah  poor tiny tim 

 they re better now again   said cratchit   wife   it
makes them weak by candle light  and i wouldn   show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home  for the world  it
must be near his time  

 past it rather   peter answered  shutting up his book 
 but i think he has walked a little slower than he used 
these few last evenings  mother  

they were very quiet again  at last she said  and in a
steady  cheerful voice  that only faltered once 

 i have known him walk with  i have known him walk
with tiny tim upon his shoulder  very fast indeed  

 and so have i   cried peter   often  

 and so have i   exclaimed another  so had all 

 but he was very light to carry   she resumed  intent upon
her work   and his father loved him so  that it was no
trouble  no trouble  and there is your father at the door  

she hurried out to meet him  and little bob in his comforter
  he had need of it  poor fellow  came in  his tea
was ready for him on the hob  and they all tried who should
help him to it most  then the two young cratchits got
upon his knees and laid  each child a little cheek  against
his face  as if they said   don   mind it  father  don   be
grieved  

bob was very cheerful with them  and spoke pleasantly to
all the family  he looked at the work upon the table  and
praised the industry and speed of mrs  cratchit and the girls 
they would be done long before sunday  he said 

 sunday  you went to day  then  robert   said his
wife 

 yes  my dear   returned bob   i wish you could have
gone  it would have done you good to see how green a
place it is  but you ll see it often  i promised him that i
would walk there on a sunday  my little  little child  
cried bob   my little child  

he broke down all at once  he couldn   help it  if he
could have helped it  he and his child would have been farther
apart perhaps than they were 

he left the room  and went up stairs into the room above 
which was lighted cheerfully  and hung with christmas 
there was a chair set close beside the child  and there were
signs of some one having been there  lately  poor bob sat
down in it  and when he had thought a little and composed
himself  he kissed the little face  he was reconciled to what
had happened  and went down again quite happy 

they drew about the fire  and talked  the girls and mother
working still  bob told them of the extraordinary kindness
of mr  scrooge   nephew  whom he had scarcely seen but
once  and who  meeting him in the street that day  and seeing
that he looked a little   just a little down you know   said
bob  inquired what had happened to distress him   on
which   said bob   for he is the pleasantest spoken gentleman
you ever heard  i told him   i am heartily sorry for it  mr 
cratchit   he said   and heartily sorry for your good wife  
by the bye  how he ever knew that  i don   know  

 knew what  my dear  

 why  that you were a good wife   replied bob 

 everybody knows that   said peter 

 very well observed  my boy   cried bob   i hope they
do   heartily sorry   he said   for your good wife  if i
can be of service to you in any way   he said  giving me
his card   that   where i live  pray come to me   now  it
wasn     cried bob   for the sake of anything he might be
able to do for us  so much as for his kind way  that this was
quite delightful  it really seemed as if he had known our
tiny tim  and felt with us  

 i   sure he   a good soul   said mrs  cratchit 

 you would be surer of it  my dear   returned bob   if
you saw and spoke to him  i shouldn   be at all surprised  
mark what i say   if he got peter a better situation  

 only hear that  peter   said mrs  cratchit 

 and then   cried one of the girls   peter will be keeping
company with some one  and setting up for himself  

 get along with you   retorted peter  grinning 

 it   just as likely as not   said bob   one of these days 
though there   plenty of time for that  my dear  but however
and whenever we part from one another  i am sure we
shall none of us forget poor tiny tim  shall we  or this
first parting that there was among us  

 never  father   cried they all 

 and i know   said bob   i know  my dears  that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was  although he
was a little  little child  we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves  and forget poor tiny tim in doing it  

 no  never  father   they all cried again 

 i am very happy   said little bob   i am very happy  

mrs  cratchit kissed him  his daughters kissed him  the
two young cratchits kissed him  and peter and himself shook
hands  spirit of tiny tim  thy childish essence was from
god 

 spectre   said scrooge   something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand  i know it  but i know not
how  tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead  

the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him  as
before  though at a different time  he thought  indeed  there
seemed no order in these latter visions  save that they were
in the future  into the resorts of business men  but showed
him not himself  indeed  the spirit did not stay for anything 
but went straight on  as to the end just now desired 
until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment 

 this court   said scrooge   through which we hurry now 
is where my place of occupation is  and has been for a length
of time  i see the house  let me behold what i shall be 
in days to come  

the spirit stopped  the hand was pointed elsewhere 

 the house is yonder   scrooge exclaimed   why do you
point away  

the inexorable finger underwent no change 

scrooge hastened to the window of his office  and looked
in  it was an office still  but not his  the furniture was
not the same  and the figure in the chair was not himself 
the phantom pointed as before 

he joined it once again  and wondering why and whither
he had gone  accompanied it until they reached an iron gate 
he paused to look round before entering 

a churchyard  here  then  the wretched man whose name
he had now to learn  lay underneath the ground  it was a
worthy place  walled in by houses  overrun by grass and
weeds  the growth of vegetation   death  not life  choked up
with too much burying  fat with repleted appetite  a
worthy place 

the spirit stood among the graves  and pointed down to
one  he advanced towards it trembling  the phantom was
exactly as it had been  but he dreaded that he saw new
meaning in its solemn shape 

 before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point  
said scrooge   answer me one question  are these the
shadows of the things that will be  or are they shadows of
things that may be  only  

still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
it stood 

 men   courses will foreshadow certain ends  to which  if
persevered in  they must lead   said scrooge   but if the
courses be departed from  the ends will change  say it is
thus with what you show me  

the spirit was immovable as ever 

scrooge crept towards it  trembling as he went  and
following the finger  read upon the stone of the neglected
grave his own name  ebenezer scrooge 

 am i that man who lay upon the bed   he cried  upon
his knees 

the finger pointed from the grave to him  and back again 

 no  spirit  oh no  no  

the finger still was there 

 spirit   he cried  tight clutching at its robe   hear me 
i am not the man i was  i will not be the man i must
have been but for this intercourse  why show me this  if i
am past all hope  

for the first time the hand appeared to shake 

 good spirit   he pursued  as down upon the ground he
fell before it   your nature intercedes for me  and pities
me  assure me that i yet may change these shadows you
have shown me  by an altered life  

the kind hand trembled 

 i will honour christmas in my heart  and try to keep it
all the year  i will live in the past  the present  and the
future  the spirits of all three shall strive within me  i
will not shut out the lessons that they teach  oh  tell me i
may sponge away the writing on this stone  

in his agony  he caught the spectral hand  it sought to
free itself  but he was strong in his entreaty  and detained it 
the spirit  stronger yet  repulsed him 

holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate
reversed  he saw an alteration in the phantom   hood and dress 
it shrunk  collapsed  and dwindled down into a bedpost 


stave     the end of it

yes  and the bedpost was his own  the bed was his own 
the room was his own  best and happiest of all  the time
before him was his own  to make amends in 

 i will live in the past  the present  and the future  
scrooge repeated  as he scrambled out of bed   the spirits
of all three shall strive within me  oh jacob marley 
heaven  and the christmas time be praised for this  i say
it on my knees  old jacob  on my knees  

he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions 
that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his
call  he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the
spirit  and his face was wet with tears 

 they are not torn down   cried scrooge  folding one of
his bed curtains in his arms   they are not torn down  rings
and all  they are here  i am here  the shadows of the
things that would have been  may be dispelled  they will
be  i know they will  

his hands were busy with his garments all this time 
turning them inside out  putting them on upside down 
tearing them  mislaying them  making them parties to every
kind of extravagance 

 i don   know what to do   cried scrooge  laughing and
crying in the same breath  and making a perfect laocoön of
himself with his stockings   i am as light as a feather  i
am as happy as an angel  i am as merry as a schoolboy  i
am as giddy as a drunken man  a merry christmas to
everybody  a happy new year to all the world  hallo
here  whoop  hallo  

he had frisked into the sitting room  and was now standing
there  perfectly winded 

 there   the saucepan that the gruel was in   cried
scrooge  starting off again  and going round the fireplace 
 there   the door  by which the ghost of jacob marley
entered  there   the corner where the ghost of christmas
present  sat  there   the window where i saw the wandering
spirits  it   all right  it   all true  it all happened 
ha ha ha  

really  for a man who had been out of practice for so
many years  it was a splendid laugh  a most illustrious laugh 
the father of a long  long line of brilliant laughs 

 i don   know what day of the month it is   said
scrooge   i don   know how long i ve been among the
spirits  i don   know anything  i   quite a baby  never
mind  i don   care  i   rather be a baby  hallo  whoop 
hallo here  

he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing
out the lustiest peals he had ever heard  clash  clang 
hammer  ding  dong  bell  bell  dong  ding  hammer  clang 
clash  oh  glorious  glorious 

running to the window  he opened it  and put out his
head  no fog  no mist  clear  bright  jovial  stirring  cold 
cold  piping for the blood to dance to  golden sunlight 
heavenly sky  sweet fresh air  merry bells  oh  glorious 
glorious 

 what   to day   cried scrooge  calling downward to a
boy in sunday clothes  who perhaps had loitered in to look
about him 

 eh   returned the boy  with all his might of wonder 

 what   to day  my fine fellow   said scrooge 

 to day   replied the boy   why  christmas day  

 it   christmas day   said scrooge to himself   i
haven   missed it  the spirits have done it all in one night 
they can do anything they like  of course they can  of
course they can  hallo  my fine fellow  

 hallo   returned the boy 

 do you know the poulterer    in the next street but one 
at the corner   scrooge inquired 

 i should hope i did   replied the lad 

 an intelligent boy   said scrooge   a remarkable boy 
do you know whether they ve sold the prize turkey that
was hanging up there   not the little prize turkey  the
big one  

 what  the one as big as me   returned the boy 

 what a delightful boy   said scrooge   it   a pleasure
to talk to him  yes  my buck  

 it   hanging there now   replied the boy 

 is it   said scrooge   go and buy it  

 walk er   exclaimed the boy 

 no  no   said scrooge   i am in earnest  go and buy
it  and tell  em to bring it here  that i may give them the
direction where to take it  come back with the man  and
i ll give you a shilling  come back with him in less than
five minutes and i ll give you half a crown  

the boy was off like a shot  he must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast 

 i ll send it to bob cratchit     whispered scrooge 
rubbing his hands  and splitting with a laugh   he sha    
know who sends it  it   twice the size of tiny tim  joe
miller never made such a joke as sending it to bob  
will be  

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one  but write it he did  somehow  and went down stairs to
open the street door  ready for the coming of the poulterer  
man  as he stood there  waiting his arrival  the knocker
caught his eye 

 i shall love it  as long as i live   cried scrooge  patting
it with his hand   i scarcely ever looked at it before 
what an honest expression it has in its face  it   a
wonderful knocker   here   the turkey  hallo  whoop 
how are you  merry christmas  

it was a turkey  he never could have stood upon his
legs  that bird  he would have snapped  em short off in a
minute  like sticks of sealing wax 

 why  it   impossible to carry that to camden town  
said scrooge   you must have a cab  

the chuckle with which he said this  and the chuckle with
which he paid for the turkey  and the chuckle with which
he paid for the cab  and the chuckle with which he recompensed
the boy  were only to be exceeded by the chuckle
with which he sat down breathless in his chair again  and
chuckled till he cried 

shaving was not an easy task  for his hand continued to
shake very much  and shaving requires attention  even when
you don   dance while you are at it  but if he had cut the
end of his nose off  he would have put a piece of
sticking plaister over it  and been quite satisfied 

he dressed himself  all in his best   and at last got out
into the streets  the people were by this time pouring forth 
as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present 
and walking with his hands behind him  scrooge regarded
every one with a delighted smile  he looked so irresistibly
pleasant  in a word  that three or four good humoured fellows
said   good morning  sir  a merry christmas to you  
and scrooge said often afterwards  that of all the blithe
sounds he had ever heard  those were the blithest in his ears 

he had not gone far  when coming on towards him he
beheld the portly gentleman  who had walked into his
counting house the day before  and said   scrooge and marley    i
believe    it sent a pang across his heart to think how this
old gentleman would look upon him when they met  but he
knew what path lay straight before him  and he took it 

 my dear sir   said scrooge  quickening his pace  and
taking the old gentleman by both his hands   how do you
do  i hope you succeeded yesterday  it was very kind of
you  a merry christmas to you  sir  

 mr  scrooge  

 yes   said scrooge   that is my name  and i fear it
may not be pleasant to you  allow me to ask your pardon 
and will you have the goodness   here scrooge whispered in
his ear 

 lord bless me   cried the gentleman  as if his breath
were taken away   my dear mr  scrooge  are you serious  

 if you please   said scrooge   not a farthing less  a
great many back payments are included in it  i assure you 
will you do me that favour  

 my dear sir   said the other  shaking hands with him 
 i don   know what to say to such munifi   

 don   say anything  please   retorted scrooge   come
and see me  will you come and see me  

 i will   cried the old gentleman  and it was clear he
meant to do it 

 thank ee   said scrooge   i am much obliged to you 
i thank you fifty times  bless you  

he went to church  and walked about the streets  and
watched the people hurrying to and fro  and patted children
on the head  and questioned beggars  and looked down into
the kitchens of houses  and up to the windows  and found
that everything could yield him pleasure  he had never
dreamed that any walk  that anything  could give him so
much happiness  in the afternoon he turned his steps
towards his nephew   house 

he passed the door a dozen times  before he had the
courage to go up and knock  but he made a dash  and
did it 

 is your master at home  my dear   said scrooge to the
girl  nice girl  very 

 yes  sir  

 where is he  my love   said scrooge 

 he   in the dining room  sir  along with mistress  i ll
show you up stairs  if you please  

 thank ee  he knows me   said scrooge  with his hand
already on the dining room lock   i ll go in here  my dear  

he turned it gently  and sidled his face in  round the door 
they were looking at the table  which was spread out in
great array   for these young housekeepers are always nervous
on such points  and like to see that everything is right 

 fred   said scrooge 

dear heart alive  how his niece by marriage started 
scrooge had forgotten  for the moment  about her sitting
in the corner with the footstool  or he wouldn   have done
it  on any account 

 why bless my soul   cried fred   who   that  

 it   i  your uncle scrooge  i have come to dinner 
will you let me in  fred  

let him in  it is a mercy he didn   shake his arm off 
he was at home in five minutes  nothing could be heartier 
his niece looked just the same  so did topper when he
came  so did the plump sister when she came  so did
every one when they came  wonderful party  wonderful
games  wonderful unanimity  won der ful happiness 

but he was early at the office next morning  oh  he was
early there  if he could only be there first  and catch bob
cratchit coming late  that was the thing he had set his
heart upon 

and he did it  yes  he did  the clock struck nine  no
bob  a quarter past  no bob  he was full eighteen
minutes and a half behind his time  scrooge sat with his
door wide open  that he might see him come into the tank 

his hat was off  before he opened the door  his comforter
too  he was on his stool in a jiffy  driving away with his
pen  as if he were trying to overtake nine o clock 

 hallo   growled scrooge  in his accustomed voice  as
near as he could feign it   what do you mean by coming
here at this time of day  

 i am very sorry  sir   said bob   i am behind my time  

 you are   repeated scrooge   yes  i think you are 
step this way  sir  if you please  

 it   only once a year  sir   pleaded bob  appearing from
the tank   it shall not be repeated  i was making rather
merry yesterday  sir  

 now  i ll tell you what  my friend   said scrooge   i
am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer  and
therefore   he continued  leaping from his stool  and giving
bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into
the tank again   and therefore i am about to raise your
salary  

bob trembled  and got a little nearer to the ruler  he
had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it 
holding him  and calling to the people in the court for help
and a strait waistcoat 

 a merry christmas  bob   said scrooge  with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken  as he clapped him on the
back   a merrier christmas  bob  my good fellow  than i
have given you  for many a year  i ll raise your salary  and
endeavour to assist your struggling family  and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon  over a christmas bowl of
smoking bishop  bob  make up the fires  and buy another
coal scuttle before you dot another i  bob cratchit  


scrooge was better than his word  he did it all  and
infinitely more  and to tiny tim  who did not die  he was
a second father  he became as good a friend  as good a
master  and as good a man  as the good old city knew  or
any other good old city  town  or borough  in the good old
world  some people laughed to see the alteration in him 
but he let them laugh  and little heeded them  for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe  for good  at which some people did not have their fill
of laughter in the outset  and knowing that such as these
would be blind anyway  he thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins  as have the malady in
less attractive forms  his own heart laughed  and that was
quite enough for him 

he had no further intercourse with spirits  but lived upon
the total abstinence principle  ever afterwards  and it was
always said of him  that he knew how to keep christmas
well  if any man alive possessed the knowledge  may that
be truly said of us  and all of us  and so  as tiny tim
observed  god bless us  every one

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

pride and prejudice

by jane austen



chapter 1


it is a truth universally acknowledged  that a single man in possession
of a good fortune  must be in want of a wife 

however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood  this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families  that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters 

 my dear mr  bennet   said his lady to him one day   have you heard that
netherfield park is let at last  

mr  bennet replied that he had not 

 but it is   returned she   for mrs  long has just been here  and she
told me all about it  

mr  bennet made no answer 

 do you not want to know who has taken it   cried his wife impatiently 

  you  want to tell me  and i have no objection to hearing it  

this was invitation enough 

 why  my dear  you must know  mrs  long says that netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of england  that he came
down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place  and was so much
delighted with it  that he agreed with mr  morris immediately  that he
is to take possession before michaelmas  and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week  

 what is his name  

 bingley  

 is he married or single  

 oh  single  my dear  to be sure  a single man of large fortune  four or
five thousand a year  what a fine thing for our girls  

 how so  how can it affect them  

 my dear mr  bennet   replied his wife   how can you be so tiresome  you
must know that i am thinking of his marrying one of them  

 is that his design in settling here  

 design  nonsense  how can you talk so  but it is very likely that he
 may  fall in love with one of them  and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes  

 i see no occasion for that  you and the girls may go  or you may send
them by themselves  which perhaps will be still better  for as you are
as handsome as any of them  mr  bingley may like you the best of the
party  

 my dear  you flatter me  i certainly  have  had my share of beauty  but
i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now  when a woman has five
grown up daughters  she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty  

 in such cases  a woman has not often much beauty to think of  

 but  my dear  you must indeed go and see mr  bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood  

 it is more than i engage for  i assure you  

 but consider your daughters  only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them  sir william and lady lucas are determined to
go  merely on that account  for in general  you know  they visit no
newcomers  indeed you must go  for it will be impossible for  us  to
visit him if you do not  

 you are over scrupulous  surely  i dare say mr  bingley will be very
glad to see you  and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls  though
i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy  

 i desire you will do no such thing  lizzy is not a bit better than the
others  and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane  nor half so
good humoured as lydia  but you are always giving  her  the preference  

 they have none of them much to recommend them   replied he   they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls  but lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters  

 mr  bennet  how  can  you abuse your own children in such a way  you
take delight in vexing me  you have no compassion for my poor nerves  

 you mistake me  my dear  i have a high respect for your nerves  they
are my old friends  i have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least  

 ah  you do not know what i suffer  

 but i hope you will get over it  and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood  

 it will be no use to us  if twenty such should come  since you will not
visit them  

 depend upon it  my dear  that when there are twenty  i will visit them
all  

mr  bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts  sarcastic humour 
reserve  and caprice  that the experience of three and twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character   her  mind
was less difficult to develop  she was a woman of mean understanding 
little information  and uncertain temper  when she was discontented 
she fancied herself nervous  the business of her life was to get her
daughters married  its solace was visiting and news 



chapter 2


mr  bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr  bingley  he
had always intended to visit him  though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go  and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it  it was then disclosed in the following
manner  observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat  he
suddenly addressed her with 

 i hope mr  bingley will like it  lizzy  

 we are not in a way to know  what  mr  bingley likes   said her mother
resentfully   since we are not to visit  

 but you forget  mamma   said elizabeth   that we shall meet him at the
assemblies  and that mrs  long promised to introduce him  

 i do not believe mrs  long will do any such thing  she has two nieces
of her own  she is a selfish  hypocritical woman  and i have no opinion
of her  

 no more have i   said mr  bennet   and i am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you  

mrs  bennet deigned not to make any reply  but  unable to contain
herself  began scolding one of her daughters 

 don   keep coughing so  kitty  for heaven   sake  have a little
compassion on my nerves  you tear them to pieces  

 kitty has no discretion in her coughs   said her father   she times
them ill  

 i do not cough for my own amusement   replied kitty fretfully   when is
your next ball to be  lizzy  

 to morrow fortnight  

 aye  so it is   cried her mother   and mrs  long does not come back
till the day before  so it will be impossible for her to introduce him 
for she will not know him herself  

 then  my dear  you may have the advantage of your friend  and introduce
mr  bingley to  her   

 impossible  mr  bennet  impossible  when i am not acquainted with him
myself  how can you be so teasing  

 i honour your circumspection  a fortnight   acquaintance is certainly
very little  one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight  but if  we  do not venture somebody else will  and after all 
mrs  long and her daughters must stand their chance  and  therefore  as
she will think it an act of kindness  if you decline the office  i will
take it on myself  

the girls stared at their father  mrs  bennet said only   nonsense 
nonsense  

 what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation   cried he   do
you consider the forms of introduction  and the stress that is laid on
them  as nonsense  i cannot quite agree with you  there   what say you 
mary  for you are a young lady of deep reflection  i know  and read
great books and make extracts  

mary wished to say something sensible  but knew not how 

 while mary is adjusting her ideas   he continued   let us return to mr 
bingley  

 i am sick of mr  bingley   cried his wife 

 i am sorry to hear  that   but why did not you tell me that before  if
i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called
on him  it is very unlucky  but as i have actually paid the visit  we
cannot escape the acquaintance now  

the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished  that of mrs 
bennet perhaps surpassing the rest  though  when the first tumult of joy
was over  she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while 

 how good it was in you  my dear mr  bennet  but i knew i should
persuade you at last  i was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance  well  how pleased i am  and it is such a
good joke  too  that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now  

 now  kitty  you may cough as much as you choose   said mr  bennet  and 
as he spoke  he left the room  fatigued with the raptures of his wife 

 what an excellent father you have  girls   said she  when the door was
shut   i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness 
or me  either  for that matter  at our time of life it is not so
pleasant  i can tell you  to be making new acquaintances every day  but
for your sakes  we would do anything  lydia  my love  though you  are 
the youngest  i dare say mr  bingley will dance with you at the next
ball  

 oh   said lydia stoutly   i am not afraid  for though i  am  the
youngest  i   the tallest  

the rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return mr  bennet   visit  and determining when they should ask him to
dinner 



chapter 3


not all that mrs  bennet  however  with the assistance of her five
daughters  could ask on the subject  was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of mr  bingley  they attacked him
in various ways  with barefaced questions  ingenious suppositions  and
distant surmises  but he eluded the skill of them all  and they were at
last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour 
lady lucas  her report was highly favourable  sir william had been
delighted with him  he was quite young  wonderfully handsome  extremely
agreeable  and  to crown the whole  he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party  nothing could be more delightful  to be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love  and very lively
hopes of mr  bingley   heart were entertained 

 if i can but see one of my daughters happily settled at netherfield  
said mrs  bennet to her husband   and all the others equally well
married  i shall have nothing to wish for  

in a few days mr  bingley returned mr  bennet   visit  and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library  he had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies  of whose beauty he had
heard much  but he saw only the father  the ladies were somewhat more
fortunate  for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat  and rode a black horse 

an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched  and already
had mrs  bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping  when an answer arrived which deferred it all  mr  bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day  and  consequently  unable
to accept the honour of their invitation  etc  mrs  bennet was quite
disconcerted  she could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire  and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another  and never
settled at netherfield as he ought to be  lady lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get
a large party for the ball  and a report soon followed that mr  bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly 
the girls grieved over such a number of ladies  but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing  that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from london  his five sisters and a cousin  and when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether  mr  bingley  his two sisters  the husband of the eldest  and
another young man 

mr  bingley was good looking and gentlemanlike  he had a pleasant
countenance  and easy  unaffected manners  his sisters were fine women 
with an air of decided fashion  his brother in law  mr  hurst  merely
looked the gentleman  but his friend mr  darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine  tall person  handsome features  noble mien  and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance  of his having ten thousand a year  the gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man  the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than mr  bingley  and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening  till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity  for he was discovered to be
proud  to be above his company  and above being pleased  and not all
his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding  disagreeable countenance  and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend 

mr  bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room  he was lively and unreserved  danced every dance 
was angry that the ball closed so early  and talked of giving
one himself at netherfield  such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves  what a contrast between him and his friend  mr  darcy danced
only once with mrs  hurst and once with miss bingley  declined being
introduced to any other lady  and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room  speaking occasionally to one of his own party 
his character was decided  he was the proudest  most disagreeable man
in the world  and everybody hoped that he would never come there again 
amongst the most violent against him was mrs  bennet  whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters 

elizabeth bennet had been obliged  by the scarcity of gentlemen  to sit
down for two dances  and during part of that time  mr  darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and mr 
bingley  who came from the dance for a few minutes  to press his friend
to join it 

 come  darcy   said he   i must have you dance  i hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner  you had much better
dance  

 i certainly shall not  you know how i detest it  unless i am
particularly acquainted with my partner  at such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable  your sisters are engaged  and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with  

 i would not be so fastidious as you are   cried mr  bingley   for a
kingdom  upon my honour  i never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as i have this evening  and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty  

  you  are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room   said mr 
darcy  looking at the eldest miss bennet 

 oh  she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld  but there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you  who is very pretty  and i
dare say very agreeable  do let me ask my partner to introduce you  

 which do you mean   and turning round he looked for a moment at
elizabeth  till catching her eye  he withdrew his own and coldly said 
 she is tolerable  but not handsome enough to tempt  me   i am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men  you had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles  for you are wasting your time with me  

mr  bingley followed his advice  mr  darcy walked off  and elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him  she told the story 
however  with great spirit among her friends  for she had a lively 
playful disposition  which delighted in anything ridiculous 

the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family  mrs 
bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield
party  mr  bingley had danced with her twice  and she had been
distinguished by his sisters  jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be  though in a quieter way  elizabeth felt jane  
pleasure  mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood  and catherine and lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners  which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball  they returned  therefore  in good
spirits to longbourn  the village where they lived  and of which they
were the principal inhabitants  they found mr  bennet still up  with
a book he was regardless of time  and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations  he had rather hoped that his wife   views on
the stranger would be disappointed  but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear 

 oh  my dear mr  bennet   as she entered the room   we have had a most
delightful evening  a most excellent ball  i wish you had been there 
jane was so admired  nothing could be like it  everybody said how well
she looked  and mr  bingley thought her quite beautiful  and danced with
her twice  only think of  that   my dear  he actually danced with her
twice  and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time  first of all  he asked miss lucas  i was so vexed to see him stand
up with her  but  however  he did not admire her at all  indeed  nobody
can  you know  and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going
down the dance  so he inquired who she was  and got introduced  and
asked her for the two next  then the two third he danced with miss king 
and the two fourth with maria lucas  and the two fifth with jane again 
and the two sixth with lizzy  and the  boulanger    

 if he had had any compassion for  me    cried her husband impatiently 
 he would not have danced half so much  for god   sake  say no more of
his partners  oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance  

 oh  my dear  i am quite delighted with him  he is so excessively
handsome  and his sisters are charming women  i never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses  i dare say the lace upon mrs 
hurst   gown   

here she was interrupted again  mr  bennet protested against any
description of finery  she was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject  and related  with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration  the shocking rudeness of mr  darcy 

 but i can assure you   she added   that lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting  his  fancy  for he is a most disagreeable  horrid man  not at
all worth pleasing  so high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him  he walked here  and he walked there  fancying himself so very
great  not handsome enough to dance with  i wish you had been there  my
dear  to have given him one of your set downs  i quite detest the man  



chapter 4


when jane and elizabeth were alone  the former  who had been cautious in
her praise of mr  bingley before  expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him 

 he is just what a young man ought to be   said she   sensible 
good humoured  lively  and i never saw such happy manners   so much
ease  with such perfect good breeding  

 he is also handsome   replied elizabeth   which a young man ought
likewise to be  if he possibly can  his character is thereby complete  

 i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time  i
did not expect such a compliment  

 did not you  i did for you  but that is one great difference between
us  compliments always take  you  by surprise  and  me  never  what
could be more natural than his asking you again  he could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room  no thanks to his gallantry for that  well  he certainly is
very agreeable  and i give you leave to like him  you have liked many a
stupider person  

 dear lizzy  

 oh  you are a great deal too apt  you know  to like people in general 
you never see a fault in anybody  all the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes  i never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life  

 i would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone  but i always speak
what i think  

 i know you do  and it is  that  which makes the wonder  with  your 
good sense  to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others  affectation of candour is common enough  one meets with it
everywhere  but to be candid without ostentation or design  to take the
good of everybody   character and make it still better  and say nothing
of the bad  belongs to you alone  and so you like this man   sisters 
too  do you  their manners are not equal to his  

 certainly not  at first  but they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them  miss bingley is to live with her brother  and keep
his house  and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her  

elizabeth listened in silence  but was not convinced  their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general  and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister 
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself  she
was very little disposed to approve them  they were in fact very fine
ladies  not deficient in good humour when they were pleased  nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it  but proud and
conceited  they were rather handsome  had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town  had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds  were in the habit of spending more than they ought  and of
associating with people of rank  and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves  and meanly of others  they were of
a respectable family in the north of england  a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother   fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade 

mr  bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father  who had intended to purchase an
estate  but did not live to do it  mr  bingley intended it likewise  and
sometimes made choice of his county  but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor  it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper  whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at netherfield  and leave the next generation to
purchase 

his sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own  but 
though he was now only established as a tenant  miss bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table  nor was mrs  hurst  who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune  less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her  mr  bingley had not been of
age two years  when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at netherfield house  he did look at it  and into it for
half an hour  was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms  satisfied with what the owner said in its praise  and took it
immediately 

between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship  in spite of
great opposition of character  bingley was endeared to darcy by the
easiness  openness  and ductility of his temper  though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own  and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied  on the strength of darcy   regard  bingley
had the firmest reliance  and of his judgement the highest opinion 
in understanding  darcy was the superior  bingley was by no means
deficient  but darcy was clever  he was at the same time haughty 
reserved  and fastidious  and his manners  though well bred  were not
inviting  in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage  bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared  darcy was continually
giving offense 

the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic  bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life  everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him  there had been no formality  no stiffness  he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room  and  as to miss bennet  he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful  darcy  on the contrary  had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion  for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest  and from none received
either attention or pleasure  miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty 
but she smiled too much 

mrs  hurst and her sister allowed it to be so  but still they admired
her and liked her  and pronounced her to be a sweet girl  and one
whom they would not object to know more of  miss bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl  and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose 



chapter 5


within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets
were particularly intimate  sir william lucas had been formerly in trade
in meryton  where he had made a tolerable fortune  and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty 
the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly  it had given him a
disgust to his business  and to his residence in a small market town 
and  in quitting them both  he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from meryton  denominated from that period lucas lodge 
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance  and 
unshackled by business  occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world  for  though elated by his rank  it did not render him
supercilious  on the contrary  he was all attention to everybody  by
nature inoffensive  friendly  and obliging  his presentation at st 
james   had made him courteous 

lady lucas was a very good kind of woman  not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to mrs  bennet  they had several children  the eldest
of them  a sensible  intelligent young woman  about twenty seven  was
elizabeth   intimate friend 

that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary  and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate 

  you  began the evening well  charlotte   said mrs  bennet with civil
self command to miss lucas    you  were mr  bingley   first choice  

 yes  but he seemed to like his second better  

 oh  you mean jane  i suppose  because he danced with her twice  to be
sure that  did  seem as if he admired her  indeed i rather believe he
 did   i heard something about it  but i hardly know what  something
about mr  robinson  

 perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr  robinson  did not
i mention it to you  mr  robinson   asking him how he liked our meryton
assemblies  and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room  and  which  he thought the prettiest  and his
answering immediately to the last question   oh  the eldest miss bennet 
beyond a doubt  there cannot be two opinions on that point   

 upon my word  well  that is very decided indeed  that does seem as
if  but  however  it may all come to nothing  you know  

  my  overhearings were more to the purpose than  yours   eliza   said
charlotte   mr  darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend 
is he   poor eliza   to be only just  tolerable   

 i beg you would not put it into lizzy   head to be vexed by his
ill treatment  for he is such a disagreeable man  that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him  mrs  long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips  

 are you quite sure  ma am   is not there a little mistake   said jane 
 i certainly saw mr  darcy speaking to her  

 aye  because she asked him at last how he liked netherfield  and he
could not help answering her  but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to  

 miss bingley told me   said jane   that he never speaks much 
unless among his intimate acquaintances  with  them  he is remarkably
agreeable  

 i do not believe a word of it  my dear  if he had been so very
agreeable  he would have talked to mrs  long  but i can guess how it
was  everybody says that he is eat up with pride  and i dare say he had
heard somehow that mrs  long does not keep a carriage  and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise  

 i do not mind his not talking to mrs  long   said miss lucas   but i
wish he had danced with eliza  

 another time  lizzy   said her mother   i would not dance with  him  
if i were you  

 i believe  ma am  i may safely promise you  never  to dance with him  

 his pride   said miss lucas   does not offend  me  so much as pride
often does  because there is an excuse for it  one cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man  with family  fortune  everything in his favour 
should think highly of himself  if i may so express it  he has a  right 
to be proud  

 that is very true   replied elizabeth   and i could easily forgive
 his  pride  if he had not mortified  mine   

 pride   observed mary  who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections   is a very common failing  i believe  by all that i have
ever read  i am convinced that it is very common indeed  that human
nature is particularly prone to it  and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some
quality or other  real or imaginary  vanity and pride are different
things  though the words are often used synonymously  a person may
be proud without being vain  pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves  vanity to what we would have others think of us  

 if i were as rich as mr  darcy   cried a young lucas  who came with
his sisters   i should not care how proud i was  i would keep a pack of
foxhounds  and drink a bottle of wine a day  

 then you would drink a great deal more than you ought   said mrs 
bennet   and if i were to see you at it  i should take away your bottle
directly  

the boy protested that she should not  she continued to declare that she
would  and the argument ended only with the visit 



chapter 6


the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield  the visit
was soon returned in due form  miss bennet   pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and though the mother was
found to be intolerable  and the younger sisters not worth speaking to 
a wish of being better acquainted with  them  was expressed towards
the two eldest  by jane  this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure  but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody  hardly excepting even her sister  and could not like them 
though their kindness to jane  such as it was  had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother   admiration  it
was generally evident whenever they met  that he  did  admire her and
to  her  it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first  and was in a
way to be very much in love  but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general  since jane
united  with great strength of feeling  a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent  she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas 

 it may perhaps be pleasant   replied charlotte   to be able to impose
on the public in such a case  but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded  if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it  she may lose the opportunity of fixing him  and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark  there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment  that it is not safe to leave any to itself  we can all
 begin  freely  a slight preference is natural enough  but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement  in nine cases out of ten a women had better show  more 
affection than she feels  bingley likes your sister undoubtedly  but he
may never do more than like her  if she does not help him on  

 but she does help him on  as much as her nature will allow  if i can
perceive her regard for him  he must be a simpleton  indeed  not to
discover it too  

 remember  eliza  that he does not know jane   disposition as you do  

 but if a woman is partial to a man  and does not endeavour to conceal
it  he must find it out  

 perhaps he must  if he sees enough of her  but  though bingley and jane
meet tolerably often  it is never for many hours together  and  as they
always see each other in large mixed parties  it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together  jane should
therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his
attention  when she is secure of him  there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses  

 your plan is a good one   replied elizabeth   where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married  and if i were determined
to get a rich husband  or any husband  i dare say i should adopt it  but
these are not jane   feelings  she is not acting by design  as yet 
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness  she has known him only a fortnight  she danced four
dances with him at meryton  she saw him one morning at his own house 
and has since dined with him in company four times  this is not quite
enough to make her understand his character  

 not as you represent it  had she merely  dined  with him  she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite  but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together  and four
evenings may do a great deal  

 yes  these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like vingt un better than commerce  but with respect to any other
leading characteristic  i do not imagine that much has been unfolded  

 well   said charlotte   i wish jane success with all my heart  and
if she were married to him to morrow  i should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth  happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance  if
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand  it does not advance their felicity in the
least  they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation  and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life  

 you make me laugh  charlotte  but it is not sound  you know it is not
sound  and that you would never act in this way yourself  

occupied in observing mr  bingley   attentions to her sister  elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend  mr  darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty  he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball  and when they next met  he looked at her only to criticise  but no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face  than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes  to
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying  though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form  he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing  and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world  he was caught by their easy playfulness  of
this she was perfectly unaware  to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere  and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with 

he began to wish to know more of her  and as a step towards conversing
with her himself  attended to her conversation with others  his doing so
drew her notice  it was at sir william lucas    where a large party were
assembled 

 what does mr  darcy mean   said she to charlotte   by listening to my
conversation with colonel forster  

 that is a question which mr  darcy only can answer  

 but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see
what he is about  he has a very satirical eye  and if i do not begin by
being impertinent myself  i shall soon grow afraid of him  

on his approaching them soon afterwards  though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking  miss lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him  which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it  she
turned to him and said 

 did you not think  mr  darcy  that i expressed myself uncommonly
well just now  when i was teasing colonel forster to give us a ball at
meryton  

 with great energy  but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic  

 you are severe on us  

 it will be  her  turn soon to be teased   said miss lucas   i am going
to open the instrument  eliza  and you know what follows  

 you are a very strange creature by way of a friend   always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody  if my vanity had taken
a musical turn  you would have been invaluable  but as it is  i would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers   on miss lucas   persevering  however 
she added   very well  if it must be so  it must   and gravely glancing
at mr  darcy   there is a fine old saying  which everybody here is of
course familiar with   keep your breath to cool your porridge   and i
shall keep mine to swell my song  

her performance was pleasing  though by no means capital  after a song
or two  and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again  she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister mary  who having  in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family  worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments  was always
impatient for display 

mary had neither genius nor taste  and though vanity had given her
application  it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner  which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached  elizabeth  easy and unaffected  had been listened to with
much more pleasure  though not playing half so well  and mary  at the
end of a long concerto  was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
scotch and irish airs  at the request of her younger sisters  who 
with some of the lucases  and two or three officers  joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room 

mr  darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening  to the exclusion of all conversation  and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was
his neighbour  till sir william thus began 

 what a charming amusement for young people this is  mr  darcy  there
is nothing like dancing after all  i consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society  

 certainly  sir  and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world  every savage can dance  

sir william only smiled   your friend performs delightfully   he
continued after a pause  on seeing bingley join the group   and i doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself  mr  darcy  

 you saw me dance at meryton  i believe  sir  

 yes  indeed  and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight  do
you often dance at st  james    

 never  sir  

 do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place  

 it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it  

 you have a house in town  i conclude  

mr  darcy bowed 

 i had once had some thought of fixing in town myself  for i am fond
of superior society  but i did not feel quite certain that the air of
london would agree with lady lucas  

he paused in hopes of an answer  but his companion was not disposed
to make any  and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them  he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing  and called out to
her 

 my dear miss eliza  why are you not dancing  mr  darcy  you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner  you
cannot refuse to dance  i am sure when so much beauty is before you  
and  taking her hand  he would have given it to mr  darcy who  though
extremely surprised  was not unwilling to receive it  when she instantly
drew back  and said with some discomposure to sir william 

 indeed  sir  i have not the least intention of dancing  i entreat you
not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner  

mr  darcy  with grave propriety  requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand  but in vain  elizabeth was determined  nor did sir william at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion 

 you excel so much in the dance  miss eliza  that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you  and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general  he can have no objection  i am sure  to oblige us
for one half hour  

 mr  darcy is all politeness   said elizabeth  smiling 

 he is  indeed  but  considering the inducement  my dear miss eliza 
we cannot wonder at his complaisance  for who would object to such a
partner  

elizabeth looked archly  and turned away  her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman  and he was thinking of her with some
complacency  when thus accosted by miss bingley 

 i can guess the subject of your reverie  

 i should imagine not  

 you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner  in such society  and indeed i am quite of your opinion 
i was never more annoyed  the insipidity  and yet the noise  the
nothingness  and yet the self importance of all those people  what would
i give to hear your strictures on them  

 your conjecture is totally wrong  i assure you  my mind was more
agreeably engaged  i have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow  

miss bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face  and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections 
mr  darcy replied with great intrepidity 

 miss elizabeth bennet  

 miss elizabeth bennet   repeated miss bingley   i am all astonishment 
how long has she been such a favourite   and pray  when am i to wish you
joy  

 that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask  a lady  
imagination is very rapid  it jumps from admiration to love  from love
to matrimony  in a moment  i knew you would be wishing me joy  

 nay  if you are serious about it  i shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled  you will be having a charming mother in law  indeed 
and  of course  she will always be at pemberley with you  

he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner  and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe  her wit flowed long 



chapter 7


mr  bennet   property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year  which  unfortunately for his daughters  was entailed 
in default of heirs male  on a distant relation  and their mother  
fortune  though ample for her situation in life  could but ill supply
the deficiency of his  her father had been an attorney in meryton  and
had left her four thousand pounds 

she had a sister married to a mr  phillips  who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business  and a brother settled in
london in a respectable line of trade 

the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton  a most
convenient distance for the young ladies  who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week  to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner   shop just over the way  the two youngest of the family 
catherine and lydia  were particularly frequent in these attentions 
their minds were more vacant than their sisters   and when nothing
better offered  a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening  and however bare of news
the country in general might be  they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt  at present  indeed  they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood  it was to remain the whole winter  and meryton was the
headquarters 

their visits to mrs  phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence  every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers  names and connections  their lodgings were not long a
secret  and at length they began to know the officers themselves  mr 
phillips visited them all  and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before  they could talk of nothing but officers  and
mr  bingley   large fortune  the mention of which gave animation
to their mother  was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign 

after listening one morning to their effusions on this subject  mr 
bennet coolly observed 

 from all that i can collect by your manner of talking  you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country  i have suspected it some time  but
i am now convinced  

catherine was disconcerted  and made no answer  but lydia  with perfect
indifference  continued to express her admiration of captain carter 
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day  as he was going the
next morning to london 

 i am astonished  my dear   said mrs  bennet   that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly  if i wished to think slightingly
of anybody   children  it should not be of my own  however  

 if my children are silly  i must hope to be always sensible of it  

 yes  but as it happens  they are all of them very clever  

 this is the only point  i flatter myself  on which we do not agree  i
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular  but i must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish  

 my dear mr  bennet  you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother  when they get to our age  i dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do  i remember the time when
i liked a red coat myself very well  and  indeed  so i do still at my
heart  and if a smart young colonel  with five or six thousand a year 
should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him  and i thought
colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir william   in
his regimentals  

 mamma   cried lydia   my aunt says that colonel forster and captain
carter do not go so often to miss watson   as they did when they first
came  she sees them now very often standing in clarke   library  

mrs  bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for miss bennet  it came from netherfield  and the servant waited
for an answer  mrs  bennet   eyes sparkled with pleasure  and she was
eagerly calling out  while her daughter read 

 well  jane  who is it from  what is it about  what does he say  well 
jane  make haste and tell us  make haste  my love  

 it is from miss bingley   said jane  and then read it aloud 

 my dear friend   

 if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with louisa and me 
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives 
for a whole day   tete a tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel  come as soon as you can on receipt of this  my brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers   yours ever 

 caroline bingley 

 with the officers   cried lydia   i wonder my aunt did not tell us of
 that   

 dining out   said mrs  bennet   that is very unlucky  

 can i have the carriage   said jane 

 no  my dear  you had better go on horseback  because it seems likely to
rain  and then you must stay all night  

 that would be a good scheme   said elizabeth   if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home  

 oh  but the gentlemen will have mr  bingley   chaise to go to meryton 
and the hursts have no horses to theirs  

 i had much rather go in the coach  

 but  my dear  your father cannot spare the horses  i am sure  they are
wanted in the farm  mr  bennet  are they not  

 they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them  

 but if you have got them to day   said elizabeth   my mother   purpose
will be answered  

she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged  jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback  and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day  her hopes were answered  jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard  her sisters were uneasy for her  but her mother was
delighted  the rain continued the whole evening without intermission 
jane certainly could not come back 

 this was a lucky idea of mine  indeed   said mrs  bennet more than
once  as if the credit of making it rain were all her own  till the
next morning  however  she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance  breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield
brought the following note for elizabeth 

 my dearest lizzy   

 i find myself very unwell this morning  which  i suppose  is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday  my kind friends will not
hear of my returning till i am better  they insist also on my seeing mr 
jones  therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me  and  excepting a sore throat and headache  there is not much the
matter with me   yours  etc  

 well  my dear   said mr  bennet  when elizabeth had read the note
aloud   if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness  if she
should die  it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
mr  bingley  and under your orders  

 oh  i am not afraid of her dying  people do not die of little trifling
colds  she will be taken good care of  as long as she stays there  it is
all very well  i would go and see her if i could have the carriage  

elizabeth  feeling really anxious  was determined to go to her  though
the carriage was not to be had  and as she was no horsewoman  walking
was her only alternative  she declared her resolution 

 how can you be so silly   cried her mother   as to think of such a
thing  in all this dirt  you will not be fit to be seen when you get
there  

 i shall be very fit to see jane  which is all i want  

 is this a hint to me  lizzy   said her father   to send for the
horses  

 no  indeed  i do not wish to avoid the walk  the distance is nothing
when one has a motive  only three miles  i shall be back by dinner  

 i admire the activity of your benevolence   observed mary   but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason  and  in my opinion 
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required  

 we will go as far as meryton with you   said catherine and lydia 
elizabeth accepted their company  and the three young ladies set off
together 

 if we make haste   said lydia  as they walked along   perhaps we may
see something of captain carter before he goes  

in meryton they parted  the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers  wives  and elizabeth continued her walk alone  crossing
field after field at a quick pace  jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity  and finding herself at last
within view of the house  with weary ankles  dirty stockings  and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise 

she was shown into the breakfast parlour  where all but jane were
assembled  and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise 
that she should have walked three miles so early in the day  in such
dirty weather  and by herself  was almost incredible to mrs  hurst and
miss bingley  and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it  she was received  however  very politely by them  and in their
brother   manners there was something better than politeness  there
was good humour and kindness  mr  darcy said very little  and mr 
hurst nothing at all  the former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion  and doubt as
to the occasion   justifying her coming so far alone  the latter was
thinking only of his breakfast 

her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered  miss
bennet had slept ill  and though up  was very feverish  and not
well enough to leave her room  elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately  and jane  who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit  was delighted at her entrance  she was not equal 
however  to much conversation  and when miss bingley left them
together  could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with  elizabeth silently attended
her 

when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters  and elizabeth
began to like them herself  when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for jane  the apothecary came  and having
examined his patient  said  as might be supposed  that she had caught
a violent cold  and that they must endeavour to get the better of it 
advised her to return to bed  and promised her some draughts  the advice
was followed readily  for the feverish symptoms increased  and her head
ached acutely  elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment  nor were
the other ladies often absent  the gentlemen being out  they had  in
fact  nothing to do elsewhere 

when the clock struck three  elizabeth felt that she must go  and very
unwillingly said so  miss bingley offered her the carriage  and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it  when jane testified such concern
in parting with her  that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present 
elizabeth most thankfully consented  and a servant was dispatched to
longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes 



chapter 8


at five o clock the two ladies retired to dress  and at half past six
elizabeth was summoned to dinner  to the civil inquiries which then
poured in  and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of mr  bingley    she could not make a very
favourable answer  jane was by no means better  the sisters  on hearing
this  repeated three or four times how much they were grieved  how
shocking it was to have a bad cold  and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves  and then thought no more of the matter  and their
indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored
elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike 

their brother  indeed  was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency  his anxiety for jane was evident  and his
attentions to herself most pleasing  and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others  she had very little notice from any but him  miss bingley was
engrossed by mr  darcy  her sister scarcely less so  and as for mr 
hurst  by whom elizabeth sat  he was an indolent man  who lived only to
eat  drink  and play at cards  who  when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout  had nothing to say to her 

when dinner was over  she returned directly to jane  and miss bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room  her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed  a mixture of pride and impertinence 
she had no conversation  no style  no beauty  mrs  hurst thought the
same  and added 

 she has nothing  in short  to recommend her  but being an excellent
walker  i shall never forget her appearance this morning  she really
looked almost wild  

 she did  indeed  louisa  i could hardly keep my countenance  very
nonsensical to come at all  why must  she  be scampering about the
country  because her sister had a cold  her hair  so untidy  so blowsy  

 yes  and her petticoat  i hope you saw her petticoat  six inches deep
in mud  i am absolutely certain  and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office  

 your picture may be very exact  louisa   said bingley   but this was
all lost upon me  i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning  her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice  

  you  observed it  mr  darcy  i am sure   said miss bingley   and i am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see  your  sister make such
an exhibition  

 certainly not  

 to walk three miles  or four miles  or five miles  or whatever it is 
above her ankles in dirt  and alone  quite alone  what could she mean by
it  it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence 
a most country town indifference to decorum  

 it shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing   said
bingley 

 i am afraid  mr  darcy   observed miss bingley in a half whisper   that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes  

 not at all   he replied   they were brightened by the exercise   a
short pause followed this speech  and mrs  hurst began again 

 i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet  she is really a very
sweet girl  and i wish with all my heart she were well settled  but with
such a father and mother  and such low connections  i am afraid there is
no chance of it  

 i think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
meryton  

 yes  and they have another  who lives somewhere near cheapside  

 that is capital   added her sister  and they both laughed heartily 

 if they had uncles enough to fill  all  cheapside   cried bingley   it
would not make them one jot less agreeable  

 but it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world   replied darcy 

to this speech bingley made no answer  but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent  and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend   vulgar relations 

with a renewal of tenderness  however  they returned to her room on
leaving the dining parlour  and sat with her till summoned to coffee 
she was still very poorly  and elizabeth would not quit her at all  till
late in the evening  when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep  and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself  on entering the drawing room she found the whole
party at loo  and was immediately invited to join them  but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it  and making her sister the
excuse  said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below  with a book  mr  hurst looked at her with astonishment 

 do you prefer reading to cards   said he   that is rather singular  

 miss eliza bennet   said miss bingley   despises cards  she is a great
reader  and has no pleasure in anything else  

 i deserve neither such praise nor such censure   cried elizabeth   i am
 not  a great reader  and i have pleasure in many things  

 in nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure   said bingley   and
i hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well  

elizabeth thanked him from her heart  and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying  he immediately offered to fetch her
others  all that his library afforded 

 and i wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit  but i am an idle fellow  and though i have not many  i have more
than i ever looked into  

elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room 

 i am astonished   said miss bingley   that my father should have left
so small a collection of books  what a delightful library you have at
pemberley  mr  darcy  

 it ought to be good   he replied   it has been the work of many
generations  

 and then you have added so much to it yourself  you are always buying
books  

 i cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these  

 neglect  i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place  charles  when you build  your  house  i wish it may be
half as delightful as pemberley  

 i wish it may  

 but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood  and take pemberley for a kind of model  there is not a
finer county in england than derbyshire  

 with all my heart  i will buy pemberley itself if darcy will sell it  

 i am talking of possibilities  charles  

 upon my word  caroline  i should think it more possible to get
pemberley by purchase than by imitation  

elizabeth was so much caught with what passed  as to leave her very
little attention for her book  and soon laying it wholly aside  she drew
near the card table  and stationed herself between mr  bingley and his
eldest sister  to observe the game 

 is miss darcy much grown since the spring   said miss bingley   will
she be as tall as i am  

 i think she will  she is now about miss elizabeth bennet   height  or
rather taller  

 how i long to see her again  i never met with anybody who delighted me
so much  such a countenance  such manners  and so extremely accomplished
for her age  her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite  

 it is amazing to me   said bingley   how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are  

 all young ladies accomplished  my dear charles  what do you mean  

 yes  all of them  i think  they all paint tables  cover screens  and
net purses  i scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this  and i am sure
i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time  without being
informed that she was very accomplished  

 your list of the common extent of accomplishments   said darcy   has
too much truth  the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen  but i am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general  i
cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen  in the whole range of my
acquaintance  that are really accomplished  

 nor i  i am sure   said miss bingley 

 then   observed elizabeth   you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman  

 yes  i do comprehend a great deal in it  

 oh  certainly   cried his faithful assistant   no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with  a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music  singing  drawing 
dancing  and the modern languages  to deserve the word  and besides
all this  she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking  the tone of her voice  her address and expressions  or the word
will be but half deserved  

 all this she must possess   added darcy   and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial  in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading  

 i am no longer surprised at your knowing  only  six accomplished women 
i rather wonder now at your knowing  any   

 are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this  

 i never saw such a woman  i never saw such capacity  and taste  and
application  and elegance  as you describe united  

mrs  hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt  and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description  when mr  hurst called them to order  with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward  as all
conversation was thereby at an end  elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room 

 elizabeth bennet   said miss bingley  when the door was closed on her 
 is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own  and with many men  i dare say  it
succeeds  but  in my opinion  it is a paltry device  a very mean art  

 undoubtedly   replied darcy  to whom this remark was chiefly addressed 
 there is a meanness in  all  the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation  whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable  

miss bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject 

elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse  and
that she could not leave her  bingley urged mr  jones being sent for
immediately  while his sisters  convinced that no country advice could
be of any service  recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians  this she would not hear of  but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother   proposal  and it was settled
that mr  jones should be sent for early in the morning  if miss bennet
were not decidedly better  bingley was quite uncomfortable  his sisters
declared that they were miserable  they solaced their wretchedness 
however  by duets after supper  while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister 



chapter 9


elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister   room  and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from mr  bingley by a housemaid 
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters  in spite of this amendment  however  she requested to have a
note sent to longbourn  desiring her mother to visit jane  and form her
own judgement of her situation  the note was immediately dispatched  and
its contents as quickly complied with  mrs  bennet  accompanied by her
two youngest girls  reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast 

had she found jane in any apparent danger  mrs  bennet would have been
very miserable  but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming  she had no wish of her recovering immediately  as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield  she
would not listen  therefore  to her daughter   proposal of being carried
home  neither did the apothecary  who arrived about the same time  think
it at all advisable  after sitting a little while with jane  on miss
bingley   appearance and invitation  the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour  bingley met them with hopes
that mrs  bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected 

 indeed i have  sir   was her answer   she is a great deal too ill to be
moved  mr  jones says we must not think of moving her  we must trespass
a little longer on your kindness  

 removed   cried bingley   it must not be thought of  my sister  i am
sure  will not hear of her removal  

 you may depend upon it  madam   said miss bingley  with cold civility 
 that miss bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us  

mrs  bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments 

 i am sure   she added   if it was not for such good friends i do not
know what would become of her  for she is very ill indeed  and suffers
a vast deal  though with the greatest patience in the world  which is
always the way with her  for she has  without exception  the sweetest
temper i have ever met with  i often tell my other girls they are
nothing to  her   you have a sweet room here  mr  bingley  and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk  i do not know a place in the
country that is equal to netherfield  you will not think of quitting it
in a hurry  i hope  though you have but a short lease  

 whatever i do is done in a hurry   replied he   and therefore if i
should resolve to quit netherfield  i should probably be off in five
minutes  at present  however  i consider myself as quite fixed here  

 that is exactly what i should have supposed of you   said elizabeth 

 you begin to comprehend me  do you   cried he  turning towards her 

 oh  yes  i understand you perfectly  

 i wish i might take this for a compliment  but to be so easily seen
through i am afraid is pitiful  

 that is as it happens  it does not follow that a deep  intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours  

 lizzy   cried her mother   remember where you are  and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home  

 i did not know before   continued bingley immediately   that you were a
studier of character  it must be an amusing study  

 yes  but intricate characters are the  most  amusing  they have at
least that advantage  

 the country   said darcy   can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study  in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society  

 but people themselves alter so much  that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever  

 yes  indeed   cried mrs  bennet  offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood   i assure you there is quite as much of  that 
going on in the country as in town  

everybody was surprised  and darcy  after looking at her for a moment 
turned silently away  mrs  bennet  who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him  continued her triumph 

 i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country  for
my part  except the shops and public places  the country is a vast deal
pleasanter  is it not  mr  bingley  

 when i am in the country   he replied   i never wish to leave it 
and when i am in town it is pretty much the same  they have each their
advantages  and i can be equally happy in either  

 aye  that is because you have the right disposition  but that
gentleman   looking at darcy   seemed to think the country was nothing
at all  

 indeed  mamma  you are mistaken   said elizabeth  blushing for her
mother   you quite mistook mr  darcy  he only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town 
which you must acknowledge to be true  

 certainly  my dear  nobody said there were  but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood  i believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger  i know we dine with four and twenty families  

nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his
countenance  his sister was less delicate  and directed her eyes towards
mr  darcy with a very expressive smile  elizabeth  for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother   thoughts  now asked her if
charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since  her  coming away 

 yes  she called yesterday with her father  what an agreeable man sir
william is  mr  bingley  is not he  so much the man of fashion  so
genteel and easy  he has always something to say to everybody   that 
is my idea of good breeding  and those persons who fancy themselves very
important  and never open their mouths  quite mistake the matter  

 did charlotte dine with you  

 no  she would go home  i fancy she was wanted about the mince pies  for
my part  mr  bingley  i always keep servants that can do their own work 
 my  daughters are brought up very differently  but everybody is to
judge for themselves  and the lucases are a very good sort of girls 
i assure you  it is a pity they are not handsome  not that i think
charlotte so  very  plain  but then she is our particular friend  

 she seems a very pleasant young woman  

 oh  dear  yes  but you must own she is very plain  lady lucas herself
has often said so  and envied me jane   beauty  i do not like to boast
of my own child  but to be sure  jane  one does not often see anybody
better looking  it is what everybody says  i do not trust my own
partiality  when she was only fifteen  there was a man at my brother
gardiner   in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away  but  however  he
did not  perhaps he thought her too young  however  he wrote some verses
on her  and very pretty they were  

 and so ended his affection   said elizabeth impatiently   there has
been many a one  i fancy  overcome in the same way  i wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love  

 i have been used to consider poetry as the  food  of love   said darcy 

 of a fine  stout  healthy love it may  everything nourishes what is
strong already  but if it be only a slight  thin sort of inclination  i
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away  

darcy only smiled  and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again  she longed to
speak  but could think of nothing to say  and after a short silence mrs 
bennet began repeating her thanks to mr  bingley for his kindness to
jane  with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy  mr  bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer  and forced his younger sister to be
civil also  and say what the occasion required  she performed her part
indeed without much graciousness  but mrs  bennet was satisfied  and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage  upon this signal  the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward  the two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit  and the result of it was  that the
youngest should tax mr  bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at netherfield 

lydia was a stout  well grown girl of fifteen  with a fine complexion
and good humoured countenance  a favourite with her mother  whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age  she had high
animal spirits  and a sort of natural self consequence  which the
attention of the officers  to whom her uncle   good dinners  and her own
easy manners recommended her  had increased into assurance  she was very
equal  therefore  to address mr  bingley on the subject of the ball  and
abruptly reminded him of his promise  adding  that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it  his answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother   ear 

 i am perfectly ready  i assure you  to keep my engagement  and when
your sister is recovered  you shall  if you please  name the very day of
the ball  but you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill  

lydia declared herself satisfied   oh  yes  it would be much better to
wait till jane was well  and by that time most likely captain carter
would be at meryton again  and when you have given  your  ball   she
added   i shall insist on their giving one also  i shall tell colonel
forster it will be quite a shame if he does not  

mrs  bennet and her daughters then departed  and elizabeth returned
instantly to jane  leaving her own and her relations  behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and mr  darcy  the latter of whom  however 
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of  her   in spite of
all miss bingley   witticisms on  fine eyes  



chapter 10


the day passed much as the day before had done  mrs  hurst and miss
bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid  who
continued  though slowly  to mend  and in the evening elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing room  the loo table  however  did not appear 
mr  darcy was writing  and miss bingley  seated near him  was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister  mr  hurst and mr  bingley were at piquet  and
mrs  hurst was observing their game 

elizabeth took up some needlework  and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between darcy and his companion  the perpetual
commendations of the lady  either on his handwriting  or on the evenness
of his lines  or on the length of his letter  with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received  formed a curious dialogue  and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each 

 how delighted miss darcy will be to receive such a letter  

he made no answer 

 you write uncommonly fast  

 you are mistaken  i write rather slowly  

 how many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year  letters of business  too  how odious i should think them  

 it is fortunate  then  that they fall to my lot instead of yours  

 pray tell your sister that i long to see her  

 i have already told her so once  by your desire  

 i am afraid you do not like your pen  let me mend it for you  i mend
pens remarkably well  

 thank you  but i always mend my own  

 how can you contrive to write so even  

he was silent 

 tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp 
and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table  and i think it infinitely superior to miss
grantley    

 will you give me leave to defer your raptures till i write again  at
present i have not room to do them justice  

 oh  it is of no consequence  i shall see her in january  but do you
always write such charming long letters to her  mr  darcy  

 they are generally long  but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine  

 it is a rule with me  that a person who can write a long letter with
ease  cannot write ill  

 that will not do for a compliment to darcy  caroline   cried her
brother   because he does  not  write with ease  he studies too much for
words of four syllables  do not you  darcy  

 my style of writing is very different from yours  

 oh   cried miss bingley   charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable  he leaves out half his words  and blots the rest  

 my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them  by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents  

 your humility  mr  bingley   said elizabeth   must disarm reproof  

 nothing is more deceitful   said darcy   than the appearance of
humility  it is often only carelessness of opinion  and sometimes an
indirect boast  

 and which of the two do you call  my  little recent piece of modesty  

 the indirect boast  for you are really proud of your defects in
writing  because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution  which  if not estimable  you
think at least highly interesting  the power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor  and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance  when you told mrs 
bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes  you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric  of compliment to yourself  and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone  and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else  

 nay   cried bingley   this is too much  to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning  and yet  upon my honour 
i believe what i said of myself to be true  and i believe it at this
moment  at least  therefore  i did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies  

 i dare say you believed it  but i am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity  your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man i know  and if  as you were
mounting your horse  a friend were to say   bingley  you had better
stay till next week   you would probably do it  you would probably not
go  and at another word  might stay a month  

 you have only proved by this   cried elizabeth   that mr  bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition  you have shown him off now much
more than he did himself  

 i am exceedingly gratified   said bingley   by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper  but i am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend  for he would certainly think better of me  if under such a
circumstance i were to give a flat denial  and ride off as fast as i
could  

 would mr  darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it  

 upon my word  i cannot exactly explain the matter  darcy must speak for
himself  

 you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine 
but which i have never acknowledged  allowing the case  however  to
stand according to your representation  you must remember  miss bennet 
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house  and
the delay of his plan  has merely desired it  asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety  

 to yield readily  easily  to the  persuasion  of a friend is no merit
with you  

 to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either  

 you appear to me  mr  darcy  to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection  a regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request  without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it  i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about mr  bingley  we may as well wait  perhaps  till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon  but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend 
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment  should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire  without waiting to be argued into it  

 will it not be advisable  before we proceed on this subject  to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request  as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties  

 by all means   cried bingley   let us hear all the particulars  not
forgetting their comparative height and size  for that will have more
weight in the argument  miss bennet  than you may be aware of  i assure
you  that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow  in comparison with
myself  i should not pay him half so much deference  i declare i do not
know a more awful object than darcy  on particular occasions  and in
particular places  at his own house especially  and of a sunday evening 
when he has nothing to do  

mr  darcy smiled  but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended  and therefore checked her laugh  miss bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received  in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense 

 i see your design  bingley   said his friend   you dislike an argument 
and want to silence this  

 perhaps i do  arguments are too much like disputes  if you and miss
bennet will defer yours till i am out of the room  i shall be very
thankful  and then you may say whatever you like of me  

 what you ask   said elizabeth   is no sacrifice on my side  and mr 
darcy had much better finish his letter  

mr  darcy took her advice  and did finish his letter 

when that business was over  he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music  miss bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte  and  after a polite request that elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived  she
seated herself 

mrs  hurst sang with her sister  and while they were thus employed 
elizabeth could not help observing  as she turned over some music books
that lay on the instrument  how frequently mr  darcy   eyes were fixed
on her  she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man  and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her  was still more strange  she could only imagine 
however  at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible  according to his ideas of right  than in
any other person present  the supposition did not pain her  she liked
him too little to care for his approbation 

after playing some italian songs  miss bingley varied the charm by
a lively scotch air  and soon afterwards mr  darcy  drawing near
elizabeth  said to her 

 do not you feel a great inclination  miss bennet  to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel  

she smiled  but made no answer  he repeated the question  with some
surprise at her silence 

 oh   said she   i heard you before  but i could not immediately
determine what to say in reply  you wanted me  i know  to say  yes  
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste  but i always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes  and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt  i have  therefore  made up my mind to tell
you  that i do not want to dance a reel at all  and now despise me if
you dare  

 indeed i do not dare  

elizabeth  having rather expected to affront him  was amazed at his
gallantry  but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody  and darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her  he really
believed  that were it not for the inferiority of her connections  he
should be in some danger 

miss bingley saw  or suspected enough to be jealous  and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth 

she often tried to provoke darcy into disliking her guest  by talking of
their supposed marriage  and planning his happiness in such an alliance 

 i hope   said she  as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day   you will give your mother in law a few hints  when this
desirable event takes place  as to the advantage of holding her tongue 
and if you can compass it  do cure the younger girls of running after
officers  and  if i may mention so delicate a subject  endeavour to
check that little something  bordering on conceit and impertinence 
which your lady possesses  

 have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity  

 oh  yes  do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt phillips be placed
in the gallery at pemberley  put them next to your great uncle the
judge  they are in the same profession  you know  only in different
lines  as for your elizabeth   picture  you must not have it taken  for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes  

 it would not be easy  indeed  to catch their expression  but their
colour and shape  and the eyelashes  so remarkably fine  might be
copied  

at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs  hurst and
elizabeth herself 

 i did not know that you intended to walk   said miss bingley  in some
confusion  lest they had been overheard 

 you used us abominably ill   answered mrs  hurst   running away without
telling us that you were coming out  

then taking the disengaged arm of mr  darcy  she left elizabeth to walk
by herself  the path just admitted three  mr  darcy felt their rudeness 
and immediately said 

 this walk is not wide enough for our party  we had better go into the
avenue  

but elizabeth  who had not the least inclination to remain with them 
laughingly answered 

 no  no  stay where you are  you are charmingly grouped  and appear
to uncommon advantage  the picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth  good bye  

she then ran gaily off  rejoicing as she rambled about  in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two  jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening 



chapter 11


when the ladies removed after dinner  elizabeth ran up to her
sister  and seeing her well guarded from cold  attended her into the
drawing room  where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure  and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared 
their powers of conversation were considerable  they could describe an
entertainment with accuracy  relate an anecdote with humour  and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit 

but when the gentlemen entered  jane was no longer the first object 
miss bingley   eyes were instantly turned toward darcy  and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps  he addressed
himself to miss bennet  with a polite congratulation  mr  hurst also
made her a slight bow  and said he was  very glad   but diffuseness
and warmth remained for bingley   salutation  he was full of joy and
attention  the first half hour was spent in piling up the fire  lest she
should suffer from the change of room  and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace  that she might be further from
the door  he then sat down by her  and talked scarcely to anyone
else  elizabeth  at work in the opposite corner  saw it all with great
delight 

when tea was over  mr  hurst reminded his sister in law of the
card table  but in vain  she had obtained private intelligence that mr 
darcy did not wish for cards  and mr  hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected  she assured him that no one intended to play  and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her  mr 
hurst had therefore nothing to do  but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep  darcy took up a book  miss bingley did the same 
and mrs  hurst  principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings  joined now and then in her brother   conversation with miss
bennet 

miss bingley   attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr 
darcy   progress through  his  book  as in reading her own  and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry  or looking at his page  she
could not win him  however  to any conversation  he merely answered her
question  and read on  at length  quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book  which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his  she gave a great yawn and said   how pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way  i declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading  how much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book  when i have a house of my own  i shall be miserable if i have not
an excellent library  

no one made any reply  she then yawned again  threw aside her book  and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement  when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet  she turned suddenly
towards him and said 

 by the bye  charles  are you really serious in meditating a dance at
netherfield  i would advise you  before you determine on it  to consult
the wishes of the present party  i am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure  

 if you mean darcy   cried her brother   he may go to bed  if he
chooses  before it begins  but as for the ball  it is quite a settled
thing  and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough  i shall send
round my cards  

 i should like balls infinitely better   she replied   if they were
carried on in a different manner  but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting  it would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day  

 much more rational  my dear caroline  i dare say  but it would not be
near so much like a ball  

miss bingley made no answer  and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room  her figure was elegant  and she walked well  but
darcy  at whom it was all aimed  was still inflexibly studious  in
the desperation of her feelings  she resolved on one effort more  and 
turning to elizabeth  said 

 miss eliza bennet  let me persuade you to follow my example  and take a
turn about the room  i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude  

elizabeth was surprised  but agreed to it immediately  miss bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility  mr  darcy looked
up  he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
elizabeth herself could be  and unconsciously closed his book  he was
directly invited to join their party  but he declined it  observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together  with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere   what could he mean  she was dying to know what could be his
meaning    and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him 

 not at all   was her answer   but depend upon it  he means to be severe
on us  and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it  

miss bingley  however  was incapable of disappointing mr  darcy in
anything  and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives 

 i have not the smallest objection to explaining them   said he  as soon
as she allowed him to speak   you either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other   confidence  and have secret
affairs to discuss  or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking  if the first  i would be
completely in your way  and if the second  i can admire you much better
as i sit by the fire  

 oh  shocking   cried miss bingley   i never heard anything so
abominable  how shall we punish him for such a speech  

 nothing so easy  if you have but the inclination   said elizabeth   we
can all plague and punish one another  tease him  laugh at him  intimate
as you are  you must know how it is to be done  

 but upon my honour  i do  not   i do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me  that   tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind  no  no  i feel he may defy us there  and as to laughter  we will
not expose ourselves  if you please  by attempting to laugh without a
subject  mr  darcy may hug himself  

 mr  darcy is not to be laughed at   cried elizabeth   that is an
uncommon advantage  and uncommon i hope it will continue  for it would
be a great loss to  me  to have many such acquaintances  i dearly love a
laugh  

 miss bingley   said he   has given me more credit than can be 
the wisest and the best of men  nay  the wisest and best of their
actions  may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke  

 certainly   replied elizabeth   there are such people  but i hope i
am not one of  them   i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good 
follies and nonsense  whims and inconsistencies   do  divert me  i own 
and i laugh at them whenever i can  but these  i suppose  are precisely
what you are without  

 perhaps that is not possible for anyone  but it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule  

 such as vanity and pride  

 yes  vanity is a weakness indeed  but pride  where there is a real
superiority of mind  pride will be always under good regulation  

elizabeth turned away to hide a smile 

 your examination of mr  darcy is over  i presume   said miss bingley 
 and pray what is the result  

 i am perfectly convinced by it that mr  darcy has no defect  he owns it
himself without disguise  

 no   said darcy   i have made no such pretension  i have faults enough 
but they are not  i hope  of understanding  my temper i dare not vouch
for  it is  i believe  too little yielding  certainly too little for the
convenience of the world  i cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as i ought  nor their offenses against myself  my feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them  my temper
would perhaps be called resentful  my good opinion once lost  is lost
forever  

  that  is a failing indeed   cried elizabeth   implacable resentment
 is  a shade in a character  but you have chosen your fault well  i
really cannot  laugh  at it  you are safe from me  

 there is  i believe  in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil  a natural defect  which not even the best education can overcome  

 and  your  defect is to hate everybody  

 and yours   he replied with a smile   is willfully to misunderstand
them  

 do let us have a little music   cried miss bingley  tired of a
conversation in which she had no share   louisa  you will not mind my
waking mr  hurst  

her sister had not the smallest objection  and the pianoforte was
opened  and darcy  after a few moments  recollection  was not sorry for
it  he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention 



chapter 12


in consequence of an agreement between the sisters  elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother  to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day  but mrs  bennet  who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday  which
would exactly finish jane   week  could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before  her answer  therefore  was not propitious  at
least not to elizabeth   wishes  for she was impatient to get home  mrs 
bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before tuesday  and in her postscript it was added  that if mr  bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer  she could spare them
very well  against staying longer  however  elizabeth was positively
resolved  nor did she much expect it would be asked  and fearful  on the
contrary  as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long 
she urged jane to borrow mr  bingley   carriage immediately  and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield
that morning should be mentioned  and the request made 

the communication excited many professions of concern  and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on jane  and till the morrow their going was deferred  miss bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay  for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other 

the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon  and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be
safe for her  that she was not enough recovered  but jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right 

to mr  darcy it was welcome intelligence  elizabeth had been at
netherfield long enough  she attracted him more than he liked  and miss
bingley was uncivil to  her   and more teasing than usual to himself 
he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should  now  escape him  nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity  sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested  his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it  steady to his purpose  he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of saturday  and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half an hour  he adhered most
conscientiously to his book  and would not even look at her 

on sunday  after morning service  the separation  so agreeable to almost
all  took place  miss bingley   civility to elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly  as well as her affection for jane  and when they parted 
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at longbourn or netherfield  and embracing her most
tenderly  she even shook hands with the former  elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits 

they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother  mrs  bennet
wondered at their coming  and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble  and was sure jane would have caught cold again  but their
father  though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure  was really
glad to see them  he had felt their importance in the family circle  the
evening conversation  when they were all assembled  had lost much of
its animation  and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and
elizabeth 

they found mary  as usual  deep in the study of thorough bass and human
nature  and had some extracts to admire  and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to  catherine and lydia had information
for them of a different sort  much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding wednesday  several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle  a private had been flogged  and it
had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married 



chapter 13


 i hope  my dear   said mr  bennet to his wife  as they were at
breakfast the next morning   that you have ordered a good dinner to day 
because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party  

 who do you mean  my dear  i know of nobody that is coming  i am sure 
unless charlotte lucas should happen to call in  and i hope  my  dinners
are good enough for her  i do not believe she often sees such at home  

 the person of whom i speak is a gentleman  and a stranger  

mrs  bennet   eyes sparkled   a gentleman and a stranger  it is mr 
bingley  i am sure  well  i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr 
bingley  but  good lord  how unlucky  there is not a bit of fish to be
got to day  lydia  my love  ring the bell  i must speak to hill this
moment  

 it is  not  mr  bingley   said her husband   it is a person whom i
never saw in the whole course of my life  

this roused a general astonishment  and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once 

after amusing himself some time with their curiosity  he thus explained 

 about a month ago i received this letter  and about a fortnight ago
i answered it  for i thought it a case of some delicacy  and requiring
early attention  it is from my cousin  mr  collins  who  when i am dead 
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases  

 oh  my dear   cried his wife   i cannot bear to hear that mentioned 
pray do not talk of that odious man  i do think it is the hardest thing
in the world  that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children  and i am sure  if i had been you  i should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it  

jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail  they
had often attempted to do it before  but it was a subject on which
mrs  bennet was beyond the reach of reason  and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters  in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about 

 it certainly is a most iniquitous affair   said mr  bennet   and
nothing can clear mr  collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn 
but if you will listen to his letter  you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself  

 no  that i am sure i shall not  and i think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all  and very hypocritical  i hate such false
friends  why could he not keep on quarreling with you  as his father did
before him  

 why  indeed  he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head  as you will hear  

 hunsford  near westerham  kent  15th october 

 dear sir   

 the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness  and since i have had the
misfortune to lose him  i have frequently wished to heal the breach  but
for some time i was kept back by my own doubts  fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance    there  mrs 
bennet    my mind  however  is now made up on the subject  for having
received ordination at easter  i have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de
bourgh  widow of sir lewis de bourgh  whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish  where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship  and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the church of england  as a clergyman  moreover  i
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence  and on these grounds i
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable  and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side  and not lead you to reject the
offered olive branch  i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters  and beg leave to apologise for
it  as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends  but of this hereafter  if you should have no objection to
receive me into your house  i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family  monday  november 18th  by four o clock  and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday se ennight
following  which i can do without any inconvenience  as lady catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday  provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day   i
remain  dear sir  with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters  your well wisher and friend 

 william collins 

 at four o clock  therefore  we may expect this peace making gentleman  
said mr  bennet  as he folded up the letter   he seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man  upon my word  and i doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance  especially if lady catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again  

 there is some sense in what he says about the girls  however  and if
he is disposed to make them any amends  i shall not be the person to
discourage him  

 though it is difficult   said jane   to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due  the wish is certainly to his
credit  

elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for lady
catherine  and his kind intention of christening  marrying  and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required 

 he must be an oddity  i think   said she   i cannot make him
out   there is something very pompous in his style   and what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail   we cannot suppose he
would help it if he could   could he be a sensible man  sir  

 no  my dear  i think not  i have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse  there is a mixture of servility and self importance in his
letter  which promises well  i am impatient to see him  

 in point of composition   said mary   the letter does not seem
defective  the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new  yet i
think it is well expressed  

to catherine and lydia  neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting  it was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat  and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour  as for
their mother  mr  collins   allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly  and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and
jane  who were dancing together  recovering himself  however  shortly 
he turned to his partner  and said   sir william   interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of  

 i do not think we were speaking at all  sir william could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves 
we have tried two or three subjects already without success  and what we
are to talk of next i cannot imagine  

 what think you of books   said he  smiling 

 books  oh  no  i am sure we never read the same  or not with the same
feelings  

 i am sorry you think so  but if that be the case  there can at least be
no want of subject  we may compare our different opinions  

 no  i cannot talk of books in a ball room  my head is always full of
something else  

 the  present  always occupies you in such scenes  does it   said he 
with a look of doubt 

 yes  always   she replied  without knowing what she said  for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject  as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming   i remember hearing you once say  mr  darcy 
that you hardly ever forgave  that your resentment once created was
unappeasable  you are very cautious  i suppose  as to its  being
created   

 i am   said he  with a firm voice 

 and never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice  

 i hope not  

 it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion 
to be secure of judging properly at first  

 may i ask to what these questions tend  

 merely to the illustration of  your  character   said she  endeavouring
to shake off her gravity   i am trying to make it out  

 and what is your success  

she shook her head   i do not get on at all  i hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly  

 i can readily believe   answered he gravely   that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me  and i could wish  miss bennet  that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment  as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either  

 but if i do not take your likeness now  i may never have another
opportunity  

 i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours   he coldly replied 
she said no more  and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence  and on each side dissatisfied  though not to an equal degree 
for in darcy   breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards
her  which soon procured her pardon  and directed all his anger against
another 

they had not long separated  when miss bingley came towards her  and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her 

 so  miss eliza  i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham 
your sister has been talking to me about him  and asking me a thousand
questions  and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you  among
his other communication  that he was the son of old wickham  the late
mr  darcy   steward  let me recommend you  however  as a friend  not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions  for as to mr  darcy  
using him ill  it is perfectly false  for  on the contrary  he has
always been remarkably kind to him  though george wickham has treated
mr  darcy in a most infamous manner  i do not know the particulars  but
i know very well that mr  darcy is not in the least to blame  that he
cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned  and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers  he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way  his coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing  indeed  and i wonder how he could presume to do it  i pity you 
miss eliza  for this discovery of your favourite   guilt  but really 
considering his descent  one could not expect much better  

 his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same   said
elizabeth angrily   for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of mr  darcy   steward  and of  that   i can
assure you  he informed me himself  

 i beg your pardon   replied miss bingley  turning away with a sneer 
 excuse my interference  it was kindly meant  

 insolent girl   said elizabeth to herself   you are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this  i see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr 
darcy   she then sought her eldest sister  who has undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of bingley  jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency  a glow of such happy expression  as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening 
elizabeth instantly read her feelings  and at that moment solicitude for
wickham  resentment against his enemies  and everything else  gave way
before the hope of jane   being in the fairest way for happiness 

 i want to know   said she  with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister     what you have learnt about mr  wickham  but perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person  in which case
you may be sure of my pardon  

 no   replied jane   i have not forgotten him  but i have nothing
satisfactory to tell you  mr  bingley does not know the whole of
his history  and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended mr  darcy  but he will vouch for the good conduct 
the probity  and honour of his friend  and is perfectly convinced that
mr  wickham has deserved much less attention from mr  darcy than he has
received  and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister   
mr  wickham is by no means a respectable young man  i am afraid he has
been very imprudent  and has deserved to lose mr  darcy   regard  

 mr  bingley does not know mr  wickham himself  

 no  he never saw him till the other morning at meryton  

 this account then is what he has received from mr  darcy  i am
satisfied  but what does he say of the living  

 he does not exactly recollect the circumstances  though he has heard
them from mr  darcy more than once  but he believes that it was left to
him  conditionally  only  

 i have not a doubt of mr  bingley   sincerity   said elizabeth warmly 
 but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only  mr 
bingley   defense of his friend was a very able one  i dare say  but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story  and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself  i shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as i did before  

she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each  and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment  elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy  though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr 
bingley   regard  and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it  on their being joined by mr  bingley himself  elizabeth withdrew
to miss lucas  to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied  before mr  collins came up to them 
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery 

 i have found out   said he   by a singular accident  that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness  i happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh  and of her mother lady
catherine  how wonderfully these sort of things occur  who would have
thought of my meeting with  perhaps  a nephew of lady catherine de
bourgh in this assembly  i am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him  which i am now going to
do  and trust he will excuse my not having done it before  my total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology  

 you are not going to introduce yourself to mr  darcy  

 indeed i am  i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier 
i believe him to be lady catherine    nephew   it will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se nnight  

elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme  assuring him
that mr  darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom  rather than a compliment to his aunt  that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side  and that if it were  it must belong to mr  darcy  the superior in
consequence  to begin the acquaintance  mr  collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination  and  when she
ceased speaking  replied thus 

 my dear miss elizabeth  i have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding  but permit me to say  that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity 
and those which regulate the clergy  for  give me leave to observe that
i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom  provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained  you must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion  which leads me to
perform what i look on as a point of duty  pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice  which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide  though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself   and with a low bow he left her to attack mr 
darcy  whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched  and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident  her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it  she felt as if hearing it all  and saw in the motion of his lips the
words  apology    hunsford   and  lady catherine de bourgh   it vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man  mr  darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder  and when at last mr  collins allowed him time
to speak  replied with an air of distant civility  mr  collins  however 
was not discouraged from speaking again  and mr  darcy   contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech  and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow  and moved another way  mr 
collins then returned to elizabeth 

 i have no reason  i assure you   said he   to be dissatisfied with my
reception  mr  darcy seemed much pleased with the attention  he answered
me with the utmost civility  and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of lady catherine   discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily  it was really a very
handsome thought  upon the whole  i am much pleased with him  

as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue  she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr  bingley  and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to 
made her perhaps almost as happy as jane  she saw her in idea settled in
that very house  in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow  and she felt capable  under such circumstances  of
endeavouring even to like bingley   two sisters  her mother   thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way  and she determined not to
venture near her  lest she might hear too much  when they sat down to
supper  therefore  she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other  and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person  lady lucas  freely 
openly  and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon
be married to mr  bingley  it was an animating subject  and mrs  bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match  his being such a charming young man  and so rich  and living but
three miles from them  were the first points of self gratulation  and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
jane  and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do  it was  moreover  such a promising thing for her younger
daughters  as jane   marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men  and lastly  it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister  that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked  it was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure  because on
such occasions it is the etiquette  but no one was less likely than mrs 
bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life  she
concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally
fortunate  though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it 

in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother  
words  or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper  for  to her inexpressible vexation  she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by mr  darcy  who sat opposite to them  her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical 

 what is mr  darcy to me  pray  that i should be afraid of him  i am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing  he  may not like to hear  

 for heaven   sake  madam  speak lower  what advantage can it be for you
to offend mr  darcy  you will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing  

nothing that she could say  however  had any influence  her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone  elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation  she could not help frequently
glancing her eye at mr  darcy  though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded  for though he was not always looking at her mother  she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her  the expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity 

at length  however  mrs  bennet had no more to say  and lady lucas  who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing  was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken  elizabeth now began to revive  but not long was the interval of
tranquillity  for  when supper was over  singing was talked of  and
she had the mortification of seeing mary  after very little entreaty 
preparing to oblige the company  by many significant looks and silent
entreaties  did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance 
but in vain  mary would not understand them  such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her  and she began her song  elizabeth  
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations  and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close  for mary  on receiving  amongst the thanks
of the table  the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again  after the pause of half a minute began another 
mary   powers were by no means fitted for such a display  her voice was
weak  and her manner affected  elizabeth was in agonies  she looked at
jane  to see how she bore it  but jane was very composedly talking to
bingley  she looked at his two sisters  and saw them making signs
of derision at each other  and at darcy  who continued  however 
imperturbably grave  she looked at her father to entreat his
interference  lest mary should be singing all night  he took the hint 
and when mary had finished her second song  said aloud   that will do
extremely well  child  you have delighted us long enough  let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit  

mary  though pretending not to hear  was somewhat disconcerted  and
elizabeth  sorry for her  and sorry for her father   speech  was afraid
her anxiety had done no good  others of the party were now applied to 

 if i   said mr  collins   were so fortunate as to be able to sing  i
should have great pleasure  i am sure  in obliging the company with an
air  for i consider music as a very innocent diversion  and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman  i do not mean  however 
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music  for there are certainly other things to be attended to  the
rector of a parish has much to do  in the first place  he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron  he must write his own sermons  and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties  and the care
and improvement of his dwelling  which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible  and i do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody 
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment  i cannot acquit
him of that duty  nor could i think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family   and with a bow to mr  darcy  he concluded his speech  which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room  many stared  many
smiled  but no one looked more amused than mr  bennet himself  while his
wife seriously commended mr  collins for having spoken so sensibly 
and observed in a half whisper to lady lucas  that he was a remarkably
clever  good kind of young man 

to elizabeth it appeared that  had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening  it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success  and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice  and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed  that his two sisters and mr  darcy  however  should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations  was bad enough 
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman  or the insolent smiles of the ladies  were more intolerable 

the rest of the evening brought her little amusement  she was teased by
mr  collins  who continued most perseveringly by her side  and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again  put it out of her
power to dance with others  in vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else  and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room 
he assured her  that as to dancing  he was perfectly indifferent to it 
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening  there was no arguing upon such a project  she owed
her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas  who often joined them  and
good naturedly engaged mr  collins   conversation to herself 

she was at least free from the offense of mr  darcy   further notice 
though often standing within a very short distance of her  quite
disengaged  he never came near enough to speak  she felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to mr  wickham  and rejoiced in
it 

the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart  and  by
a manoeuvre of mrs  bennet  had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone  which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family  mrs  hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths  except to complain of fatigue  and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves  they repulsed
every attempt of mrs  bennet at conversation  and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party  which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of mr  collins  who was complimenting mr  bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment  and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests  darcy said
nothing at all  mr  bennet  in equal silence  was enjoying the scene 
mr  bingley and jane were standing together  a little detached from the
rest  and talked only to each other  elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either mrs  hurst or miss bingley  and even lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of  lord 
how tired i am   accompanied by a violent yawn 

when at length they arose to take leave  mrs  bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn  and
addressed herself especially to mr  bingley  to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time  without
the ceremony of a formal invitation  bingley was all grateful pleasure 
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her  after his return from london  whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time 

mrs  bennet was perfectly satisfied  and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that  allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements  new carriages  and wedding clothes  she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four
months  of having another daughter married to mr  collins  she thought
with equal certainty  and with considerable  though not equal  pleasure 
elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children  and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for  her   the worth of each
was eclipsed by mr  bingley and netherfield 



chapter 19


the next day opened a new scene at longbourn  mr  collins made his
declaration in form  having resolved to do it without loss of time  as
his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday  and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment  he set about it in a very orderly manner  with all the
observances  which he supposed a regular part of the business  on
finding mrs  bennet  elizabeth  and one of the younger girls together 
soon after breakfast  he addressed the mother in these words 

 may i hope  madam  for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth 
when i solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning  

before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise  mrs 
bennet answered instantly   oh dear   yes  certainly  i am sure lizzy
will be very happy  i am sure she can have no objection  come  kitty  i
want you up stairs   and  gathering her work together  she was hastening
away  when elizabeth called out 

 dear madam  do not go  i beg you will not go  mr  collins must excuse
me  he can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear  i am
going away myself  

 no  no  nonsense  lizzy  i desire you to stay where you are   and upon
elizabeth   seeming really  with vexed and embarrassed looks  about to
escape  she added   lizzy  i  insist  upon your staying and hearing mr 
collins  

elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction  and a moment  
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible  she sat down again and tried to
conceal  by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion  mrs  bennet and kitty walked off  and as soon as
they were gone  mr  collins began 

 believe me  my dear miss elizabeth  that your modesty  so far from
doing you any disservice  rather adds to your other perfections  you
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there  not  been this little
unwillingness  but allow me to assure you  that i have your respected
mother   permission for this address  you can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse  however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble  my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken  almost as
soon as i entered the house  i singled you out as the companion of
my future life  but before i am run away with by my feelings on this
subject  perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying  and  moreover  for coming into hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife  as i certainly did  

the idea of mr  collins  with all his solemn composure  being run away
with by his feelings  made elizabeth so near laughing  that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further 
and he continued 

 my reasons for marrying are  first  that i think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances  like myself  to set the example
of matrimony in his parish  secondly  that i am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness  and thirdly  which perhaps i ought
to have mentioned earlier  that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling
patroness  twice has she condescended to give me her opinion  unasked
too   on this subject  and it was but the very saturday night before i
left hunsford  between our pools at quadrille  while mrs  jenkinson was
arranging miss de bourgh   footstool  that she said   mr  collins  you
must marry  a clergyman like you must marry  choose properly  choose
a gentlewoman for  my  sake  and for your  own   let her be an active 
useful sort of person  not brought up high  but able to make a small
income go a good way  this is my advice  find such a woman as soon as
you can  bring her to hunsford  and i will visit her   allow me  by the
way  to observe  my fair cousin  that i do not reckon the notice
and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer  you will find her manners beyond
anything i can describe  and your wit and vivacity  i think  must be
acceptable to her  especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite  thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony  it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood  where i
can assure you there are many amiable young women  but the fact is  that
being  as i am  to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father  who  however  may live many years longer   i could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters  that
the loss to them might be as little as possible  when the melancholy
event takes place  which  however  as i have already said  may not
be for several years  this has been my motive  my fair cousin  and
i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem  and now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection  to fortune i am perfectly indifferent  and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father  since i am well
aware that it could not be complied with  and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents  which will not be yours till after your mother  
decease  is all that you may ever be entitled to  on that head 
therefore  i shall be uniformly silent  and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married  

it was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now 

 you are too hasty  sir   she cried   you forget that i have made no
answer  let me do it without further loss of time  accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me  i am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals  but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them  

 i am not now to learn   replied mr  collins  with a formal wave of the
hand   that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept  when he first applies for their
favour  and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second  or even a
third time  i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said  and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long  

 upon my word  sir   cried elizabeth   your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration  i do assure you that i am not
one of those young ladies  if such young ladies there are  who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time  i am perfectly serious in my refusal  you could not make  me 
happy  and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who
could make you so  nay  were your friend lady catherine to know me  i
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation  

 were it certain that lady catherine would think so   said mr  collins
very gravely   but i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you  and you may be certain when i have the honour of
seeing her again  i shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty  economy  and other amiable qualification  

 indeed  mr  collins  all praise of me will be unnecessary  you
must give me leave to judge for myself  and pay me the compliment
of believing what i say  i wish you very happy and very rich  and by
refusing your hand  do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise 
in making me the offer  you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family  and may take possession of longbourn
estate whenever it falls  without any self reproach  this matter may
be considered  therefore  as finally settled   and rising as she
thus spoke  she would have quitted the room  had mr  collins not thus
addressed her 

 when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject  i
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me  though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present  because i
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application  and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character  

 really  mr  collins   cried elizabeth with some warmth   you puzzle me
exceedingly  if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement  i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one  

 you must give me leave to flatter myself  my dear cousin  that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course  my reasons for
believing it are briefly these  it does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance  or that the establishment i can offer would
be any other than highly desirable  my situation in life  my connections
with the family of de bourgh  and my relationship to your own  are
circumstances highly in my favour  and you should take it into further
consideration  that in spite of your manifold attractions  it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you  your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications  as i must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me 
i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense  according to the usual practice of elegant females  

 i do assure you  sir  that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man  i would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere  i thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals  but
to accept them is absolutely impossible  my feelings in every respect
forbid it  can i speak plainer  do not consider me now as an elegant
female  intending to plague you  but as a rational creature  speaking
the truth from her heart  

 you are uniformly charming   cried he  with an air of awkward
gallantry   and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents  my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable  

to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make
no reply  and immediately and in silence withdrew  determined  if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement  to apply to her father  whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive  and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female 



chapter 20


mr  collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love  for mrs  bennet  having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference  no sooner saw elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase  than she
entered the breakfast room  and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection  mr  collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure  and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview  with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied  since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character 

this information  however  startled mrs  bennet  she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals  but she dared not believe it 
and could not help saying so 

 but  depend upon it  mr  collins   she added   that lizzy shall be
brought to reason  i will speak to her about it directly  she is a very
headstrong  foolish girl  and does not know her own interest but i will
 make  her know it  

 pardon me for interrupting you  madam   cried mr  collins   but if
she is really headstrong and foolish  i know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation  who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state  if therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit  perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me  because if liable to such defects of
temper  she could not contribute much to my felicity  

 sir  you quite misunderstand me   said mrs  bennet  alarmed   lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these  in everything else she is as
good natured a girl as ever lived  i will go directly to mr  bennet  and
we shall very soon settle it with her  i am sure  

she would not give him time to reply  but hurrying instantly to her
husband  called out as she entered the library   oh  mr  bennet  you
are wanted immediately  we are all in an uproar  you must come and make
lizzy marry mr  collins  for she vows she will not have him  and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have  her   

mr  bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered  and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication 

 i have not the pleasure of understanding you   said he  when she had
finished her speech   of what are you talking  

 of mr  collins and lizzy  lizzy declares she will not have mr  collins 
and mr  collins begins to say that he will not have lizzy  

 and what am i to do on the occasion  it seems an hopeless business  

 speak to lizzy about it yourself  tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him  

 let her be called down  she shall hear my opinion  

mrs  bennet rang the bell  and miss elizabeth was summoned to the
library 

 come here  child   cried her father as she appeared   i have sent for
you on an affair of importance  i understand that mr  collins has made
you an offer of marriage  is it true   elizabeth replied that it was 
 very well  and this offer of marriage you have refused  

 i have  sir  

 very well  we now come to the point  your mother insists upon your
accepting it  is it not so  mrs  bennet  

 yes  or i will never see her again  

 an unhappy alternative is before you  elizabeth  from this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents  your mother will never see you
again if you do  not  marry mr  collins  and i will never see you again
if you  do   

elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning 
but mrs  bennet  who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished  was excessively disappointed 

 what do you mean  mr  bennet  in talking this way  you promised me to
 insist  upon her marrying him  

 my dear   replied her husband   i have two small favours to request 
first  that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion  and secondly  of my room  i shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be  

not yet  however  in spite of her disappointment in her husband  did
mrs  bennet give up the point  she talked to elizabeth again and again 
coaxed and threatened her by turns  she endeavoured to secure jane
in her interest  but jane  with all possible mildness  declined
interfering  and elizabeth  sometimes with real earnestness  and
sometimes with playful gaiety  replied to her attacks  though her manner
varied  however  her determination never did 

mr  collins  meanwhile  was meditating in solitude on what had passed 
he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him  and though his pride was hurt  he suffered in no other
way  his regard for her was quite imaginary  and the possibility of her
deserving her mother   reproach prevented his feeling any regret 

while the family were in this confusion  charlotte lucas came to spend
the day with them  she was met in the vestibule by lydia  who  flying to
her  cried in a half whisper   i am glad you are come  for there is such
fun here  what do you think has happened this morning  mr  collins has
made an offer to lizzy  and she will not have him  

charlotte hardly had time to answer  before they were joined by kitty 
who came to tell the same news  and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast room  where mrs  bennet was alone  than she likewise began on
the subject  calling on miss lucas for her compassion  and entreating
her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family   pray do  my dear miss lucas   she added in a melancholy tone 
 for nobody is on my side  nobody takes part with me  i am cruelly used 
nobody feels for my poor nerves  

charlotte   reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth 

 aye  there she comes   continued mrs  bennet   looking as unconcerned
as may be  and caring no more for us than if we were at york  provided
she can have her own way  but i tell you  miss lizzy  if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way 
you will never get a husband at all  and i am sure i do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead  i shall not be able to keep
you  and so i warn you  i have done with you from this very day  i told
you in the library  you know  that i should never speak to you again 
and you will find me as good as my word  i have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children  not that i have much pleasure  indeed  in talking
to anybody  people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking  nobody can tell what i suffer  but it
is always so  those who do not complain are never pitied  

her daughters listened in silence to this effusion  sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation  she talked on  therefore  without interruption from any of
them  till they were joined by mr  collins  who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual  and on perceiving whom  she said to
the girls   now  i do insist upon it  that you  all of you  hold
your tongues  and let me and mr  collins have a little conversation
together  

elizabeth passed quietly out of the room  jane and kitty followed  but
lydia stood her ground  determined to hear all she could  and charlotte 
detained first by the civility of mr  collins  whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute  and then by a little
curiosity  satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear  in a doleful voice mrs  bennet began the projected
conversation   oh  mr  collins  

 my dear madam   replied he   let us be for ever silent on this point 
far be it from me   he presently continued  in a voice that marked his
displeasure   to resent the behaviour of your daughter  resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all  the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment 
and i trust i am resigned  perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand 
for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation  you will not  i hope  consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family  my dear madam  by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter   favour  without having paid yourself and mr  bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf  my conduct may  i fear  be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter   lips instead of your own  but we are all
liable to error  i have certainly meant well through the whole affair 
my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself  with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family  and if my  manner 
has been at all reprehensible  i here beg leave to apologise  



chapter 21


the discussion of mr  collins   offer was now nearly at an end  and
elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it  and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother  as for the gentleman himself   his  feelings were chiefly
expressed  not by embarrassment or dejection  or by trying to avoid her 
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence  he scarcely ever spoke
to her  and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas  whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all  and
especially to her friend 

the morrow produced no abatement of mrs  bennet   ill humour or ill
health  mr  collins was also in the same state of angry pride  elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit  but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it  he was always to have gone on
saturday  and to saturday he meant to stay 

after breakfast  the girls walked to meryton to inquire if mr  wickham
were returned  and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball 
he joined them on their entering the town  and attended them to their
aunt   where his regret and vexation  and the concern of everybody  was
well talked over  to elizabeth  however  he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence  had  been self imposed 

 i found   said he   as the time drew near that i had better not meet
mr  darcy  that to be in the same room  the same party with him for so
many hours together  might be more than i could bear  and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself  

she highly approved his forbearance  and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it  and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other  as wickham and another officer walked back with
them to longbourn  and during the walk he particularly attended to
her  his accompanying them was a double advantage  she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself  and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother 

soon after their return  a letter was delivered to miss bennet  it came
from netherfield  the envelope contained a sheet of elegant  little 
hot pressed paper  well covered with a lady   fair  flowing hand  and
elizabeth saw her sister   countenance change as she read it  and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages  jane recollected
herself soon  and putting the letter away  tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation  but elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham  and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave  than a glance from jane
invited her to follow her up stairs  when they had gained their own room 
jane  taking out the letter  said 

 this is from caroline bingley  what it contains has surprised me a good
deal  the whole party have left netherfield by this time  and are on
their way to town  and without any intention of coming back again  you
shall hear what she says  

she then read the first sentence aloud  which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly 
and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street  where mr  hurst had a
house  the next was in these words   i do not pretend to regret anything
i shall leave in hertfordshire  except your society  my dearest friend 
but we will hope  at some future period  to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known  and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence  i depend on you for that   to these highflown
expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust 
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her  she saw
nothing in it really to lament  it was not to be supposed that their
absence from netherfield would prevent mr  bingley   being there  and as
to the loss of their society  she was persuaded that jane must cease to
regard it  in the enjoyment of his 

 it is unlucky   said she  after a short pause   that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country  but may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware  and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters  mr  bingley will not be detained in london by
them  

 caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
hertfordshire this winter  i will read it to you  

 when my brother left us yesterday  he imagined that the business which
took him to london might be concluded in three or four days  but as we
are certain it cannot be so  and at the same time convinced that when
charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again  we have
determined on following him thither  that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel  many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter  i wish that i could hear that you  my
dearest friend  had any intention of making one of the crowd  but of
that i despair  i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings  and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you  

 it is evident by this   added jane   that he comes back no more this
winter  

 it is only evident that miss bingley does not mean that he  should   

 why will you think so  it must be his own doing  he is his own
master  but you do not know  all   i  will  read you the passage which
particularly hurts me  i will have no reserves from  you   

 mr  darcy is impatient to see his sister  and  to confess the truth 
 we  are scarcely less eager to meet her again  i really do not think
georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty  elegance  and accomplishments 
and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting  from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister  i do not know whether i ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject  but i will not leave the
country without confiding them  and i trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable  my brother admires her greatly already  he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing 
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own  and a sister  
partiality is not misleading me  i think  when i call charles most
capable of engaging any woman   heart  with all these circumstances to
favour an attachment  and nothing to prevent it  am i wrong  my dearest
jane  in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many  

 what do you think of  this  sentence  my dear lizzy   said jane as she
finished it   is it not clear enough  does it not expressly declare that
caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister  that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother   indifference  and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him  she means  most kindly   to
put me on my guard  can there be any other opinion on the subject  

 yes  there can  for mine is totally different  will you hear it  

 most willingly  

 you shall have it in a few words  miss bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you  and wants him to marry miss darcy  she follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there  and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you  

jane shook her head 

 indeed  jane  you ought to believe me  no one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection  miss bingley  i am sure  cannot  she
is not such a simpleton  could she have seen half as much love in mr 
darcy for herself  she would have ordered her wedding clothes  but the
case is this  we are not rich enough or grand enough for them  and she
is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother  from the notion
that when there has been  one  intermarriage  she may have less trouble
in achieving a second  in which there is certainly some ingenuity  and
i dare say it would succeed  if miss de bourgh were out of the way  but 
my dearest jane  you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy  he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of  your  merit than when he took leave of you on
tuesday  or that it will be in her power to persuade him that  instead
of being in love with you  he is very much in love with her friend  

 if we thought alike of miss bingley   replied jane   your
representation of all this might make me quite easy  but i know the
foundation is unjust  caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone  and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself  

 that is right  you could not have started a more happy idea  since you
will not take comfort in mine  believe her to be deceived  by all means 
you have now done your duty by her  and must fret no longer  

 but  my dear sister  can i be happy  even supposing the best  in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere  

 you must decide for yourself   said elizabeth   and if  upon mature
deliberation  you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife  i advise you by
all means to refuse him  

 how can you talk so   said jane  faintly smiling   you must know that
though i should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation  i could
not hesitate  

 i did not think you would  and that being the case  i cannot consider
your situation with much compassion  

 but if he returns no more this winter  my choice will never be
required  a thousand things may arise in six months  

the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt  it appeared to her merely the suggestion of caroline  
interested wishes  and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes  however openly or artfully spoken  could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone 

she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject  and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect 
jane   temper was not desponding  and she was gradually led to hope 
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope  that
bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart 

they agreed that mrs  bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family  without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman   conduct 
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern 
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together  after
lamenting it  however  at some length  she had the consolation that mr 
bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn  and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration  that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner  she would take care to have two
full courses 



chapter 22


the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the
chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr  collins 
elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her   it keeps him in good
humour   said she   and i am more obliged to you than i can express  
charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful  and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time  this was
very amiable  but charlotte   kindness extended farther than elizabeth
had any conception of  its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of mr  collins   addresses  by engaging them towards
herself  such was miss lucas   scheme  and appearances were so
favourable  that when they parted at night  she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very
soon  but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character  for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next
morning with admirable slyness  and hasten to lucas lodge to throw
himself at her feet  he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins 
from a conviction that if they saw him depart  they could not fail to
conjecture his design  and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise  for though feeling almost
secure  and with reason  for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging 
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday 
his reception  however  was of the most flattering kind  miss lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house  and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane  but little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there 

in as short a time as mr  collins   long speeches would allow 
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both  and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men  and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present  the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness  the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance  and miss lucas  who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment  cared not how soon that
establishment were gained 

sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent 
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity  mr  collins   present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter  to whom
they could give little fortune  and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair  lady lucas began directly to calculate  with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before  how many years longer
mr  bennet was likely to live  and sir william gave it as his decided
opinion  that whenever mr  collins should be in possession of the
longbourn estate  it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at st  james    the whole family  in short 
were properly overjoyed on the occasion  the younger girls formed hopes
of  coming out  a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done  and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlotte  
dying an old maid  charlotte herself was tolerably composed  she had
gained her point  and had time to consider of it  her reflections were
in general satisfactory  mr  collins  to be sure  was neither sensible
nor agreeable  his society was irksome  and his attachment to her must
be imaginary  but still he would be her husband  without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony  marriage had always been her object  it was
the only provision for well educated young women of small fortune 
and however uncertain of giving happiness  must be their pleasantest
preservative from want  this preservative she had now obtained  and at
the age of twenty seven  without having ever been handsome  she felt all
the good luck of it  the least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet  whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person  elizabeth would wonder 
and probably would blame her  and though her resolution was not to be
shaken  her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation  she resolved
to give her the information herself  and therefore charged mr  collins 
when he returned to longbourn to dinner  to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family  a promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given  but it could not be kept without difficulty  for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade  and he was
at the same time exercising great self denial  for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love 

as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family  the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night  and mrs  bennet  with great politeness and cordiality 
said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again  whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them 

 my dear madam   he replied   this invitation is particularly
gratifying  because it is what i have been hoping to receive  and
you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible  

they were all astonished  and mr  bennet  who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return  immediately said 

 but is there not danger of lady catherine   disapprobation here  my
good sir  you had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness  

 my dear sir   replied mr  collins   i am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution  and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship   concurrence  

 you cannot be too much upon your guard  risk anything rather than her
displeasure  and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again  which i should think exceedingly probable  stay quietly at home 
and be satisfied that  we  shall take no offence  

 believe me  my dear sir  my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention  and depend upon it  you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this  and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in hertfordshire  as for my fair cousins  though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary  i shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness  not excepting my
cousin elizabeth  

with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew  all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return  mrs  bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls  and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him 
she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others  there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her  and though by no
means so clever as herself  she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers  he might become a very
agreeable companion  but on the following morning  every hope of this
kind was done away  miss lucas called soon after breakfast  and in a
private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before 

the possibility of mr  collins   fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two  but
that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself  and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum  and
she could not help crying out 

 engaged to mr  collins  my dear charlotte  impossible  

the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her
story  gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach  though  as it was no more than she expected  she soon regained
her composure  and calmly replied 

 why should you be surprised  my dear eliza  do you think it incredible
that mr  collins should be able to procure any woman   good opinion 
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you  

but elizabeth had now recollected herself  and making a strong effort
for it  was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her  and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness 

 i see what you are feeling   replied charlotte   you must be surprised 
very much surprised  so lately as mr  collins was wishing to marry
you  but when you have had time to think it over  i hope you will be
satisfied with what i have done  i am not romantic  you know  i never
was  i ask only a comfortable home  and considering mr  collins  
character  connection  and situation in life  i am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state  

elizabeth quietly answered  undoubtedly   and after an awkward pause 
they returned to the rest of the family  charlotte did not stay much
longer  and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard 
it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match  the strangeness of mr  collins   making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted  she had always felt that charlotte   opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own  but she had not supposed it to be possible
that  when called into action  she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage  charlotte the wife of mr  collins was a
most humiliating picture  and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem  was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen 



chapter 23


elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters  reflecting on what
she had heard  and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it  when sir william lucas himself appeared  sent by his daughter  to
announce her engagement to the family  with many compliments to them 
and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses  he unfolded the matter  to an audience not merely wondering  but
incredulous  for mrs  bennet  with more perseverance than politeness 
protested he must be entirely mistaken  and lydia  always unguarded and
often uncivil  boisterously exclaimed 

 good lord  sir william  how can you tell such a story  do not you know
that mr  collins wants to marry lizzy  

nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment  but sir william   good breeding carried
him through it all  and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information  he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy 

elizabeth  feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation  now put herself forward to confirm his account  by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself  and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william  in which she
was readily joined by jane  and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match  the excellent character
of mr  collins  and the convenient distance of hunsford from london 

mrs  bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
sir william remained  but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent  in the first place  she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter  secondly  she was very sure that mr  collins
had been taken in  thirdly  she trusted that they would never be
happy together  and fourthly  that the match might be broken off  two
inferences  however  were plainly deduced from the whole  one  that
elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief  and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all  and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day  nothing could
console and nothing could appease her  nor did that day wear out her
resentment  a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without
scolding her  a month passed away before she could speak to sir william
or lady lucas without being rude  and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter 

mr  bennet   emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion  and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort  for
it gratified him  he said  to discover that charlotte lucas  whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible  was as foolish as his wife  and
more foolish than his daughter 

jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match  but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness 
nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable  kitty
and lydia were far from envying miss lucas  for mr  collins was only a
clergyman  and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at meryton 

lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on mrs  bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married  and she
called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was 
though mrs  bennet   sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away 

between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject  and elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again  her
disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister  of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken  and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious 
as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return 

jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter  and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again  the promised
letter of thanks from mr  collins arrived on tuesday  addressed to
their father  and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth   abode in the family might have prompted  after discharging
his conscience on that head  he proceeded to inform them  with many
rapturous expressions  of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour  miss lucas  and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn  whither
he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight  for lady catherine 
he added  so heartily approved his marriage  that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible  which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men 

mr  collins   return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to mrs  bennet  on the contrary  she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband  it was very strange that he should come
to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge  it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome  she hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent  and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable  such were the gentle murmurs of mrs  bennet  and
they gave way only to the greater distress of mr  bingley   continued
absence 

neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject  day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to
netherfield the whole winter  a report which highly incensed mrs 
bennet  and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood 

even elizabeth began to fear  not that bingley was indifferent  but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away  unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane   happiness  and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover  she could not prevent its
frequently occurring  the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend  assisted by the attractions of miss
darcy and the amusements of london might be too much  she feared  for
the strength of his attachment 

as for jane   her  anxiety under this suspense was  of course  more
painful than elizabeth    but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing  and between herself and elizabeth  therefore  the subject
was never alluded to  but as no such delicacy restrained her mother 
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley  express her
impatience for his arrival  or even require jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used  it needed
all jane   steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity 

mr  collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight  but his
reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction  he was too happy  however  to need much attention 
and luckily for the others  the business of love making relieved them
from a great deal of his company  the chief of every day was spent by
him at lucas lodge  and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed 

mrs  bennet was really in a most pitiable state  the very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour 
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of  the sight
of miss lucas was odious to her  as her successor in that house  she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence  whenever charlotte came to see
them  she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession  and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr  collins  was convinced that
they were talking of the longbourn estate  and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house  as soon as mr  bennet were dead  she
complained bitterly of all this to her husband 

 indeed  mr  bennet   said she   it is very hard to think that charlotte
lucas should ever be mistress of this house  that i should be forced to
make way for  her   and live to see her take her place in it  

 my dear  do not give way to such gloomy thoughts  let us hope for
better things  let us flatter ourselves that i may be the survivor  

this was not very consoling to mrs  bennet  and therefore  instead of
making any answer  she went on as before 

 i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate  if it was
not for the entail  i should not mind it  

 what should not you mind  

 i should not mind anything at all  

 let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility  

 i never can be thankful  mr  bennet  for anything about the entail  how
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one   own
daughters  i cannot understand  and all for the sake of mr  collins too 
why should  he  have it more than anybody else  

 i leave it to yourself to determine   said mr  bennet 



chapter 24


miss bingley   letter arrived  and put an end to doubt  the very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for
the winter  and concluded with her brother   regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left
the country 

hope was over  entirely over  and when jane could attend to the rest
of the letter  she found little  except the professed affection of the
writer  that could give her any comfort  miss darcy   praise occupied
the chief of it  her many attractions were again dwelt on  and caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy  and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter  she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother   being an
inmate of mr  darcy   house  and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture 

elizabeth  to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this 
heard it in silent indignation  her heart was divided between concern
for her sister  and resentment against all others  to caroline  
assertion of her brother   being partial to miss darcy she paid no
credit  that he was really fond of jane  she doubted no more than she
had ever done  and much as she had always been disposed to like him  she
could not think without anger  hardly without contempt  on that easiness
of temper  that want of proper resolution  which now made him the slave
of his designing friends  and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination  had his own happiness  however 
been the only sacrifice  he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best  but her sister   was involved in it  as
she thought he must be sensible himself  it was a subject  in short 
on which reflection would be long indulged  and must be unavailing  she
could think of nothing else  and yet whether bingley   regard had really
died away  or were suppressed by his friends  interference  whether
he had been aware of jane   attachment  or whether it had escaped his
observation  whatever were the case  though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference  her sister   situation remained
the same  her peace equally wounded 

a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
elizabeth  but at last  on mrs  bennet   leaving them together  after a
longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master  she could
not help saying 

 oh  that my dear mother had more command over herself  she can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him  but
i will not repine  it cannot last long  he will be forgot  and we shall
all be as we were before  

elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude  but said
nothing 

 you doubt me   cried jane  slightly colouring   indeed  you have
no reason  he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance  but that is all  i have nothing either to hope or fear 
and nothing to reproach him with  thank god  i have not  that  pain  a
little time  therefore  i shall certainly try to get the better  

with a stronger voice she soon added   i have this comfort immediately 
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side  and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself  

 my dear jane   exclaimed elizabeth   you are too good  your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic  i do not know what to say
to you  i feel as if i had never done you justice  or loved you as you
deserve  

miss bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit  and threw back
the praise on her sister   warm affection 

 nay   said elizabeth   this is not fair   you  wish to think all the
world respectable  and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody  i only want
to think  you  perfect  and you set yourself against it  do not
be afraid of my running into any excess  of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good will  you need not  there are few people
whom i really love  and still fewer of whom i think well  the more i see
of the world  the more am i dissatisfied with it  and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters  and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense  i have met with two instances lately  one i will not mention  the
other is charlotte   marriage  it is unaccountable  in every view it is
unaccountable  

 my dear lizzy  do not give way to such feelings as these  they will
ruin your happiness  you do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper  consider mr  collins   respectability  and
charlotte   steady  prudent character  remember that she is one of a
large family  that as to fortune  it is a most eligible match  and be
ready to believe  for everybody   sake  that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin  

 to oblige you  i would try to believe almost anything  but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this  for were i persuaded that
charlotte had any regard for him  i should only think worse of her
understanding than i now do of her heart  my dear jane  mr  collins is a
conceited  pompous  narrow minded  silly man  you know he is  as well as
i do  and you must feel  as well as i do  that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking  you shall not defend her  though
it is charlotte lucas  you shall not  for the sake of one individual 
change the meaning of principle and integrity  nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me  that selfishness is prudence  and insensibility of
danger security for happiness  

 i must think your language too strong in speaking of both   replied
jane   and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together  but enough of this  you alluded to something else  you
mentioned  two  instances  i cannot misunderstand you  but i entreat
you  dear lizzy  not to pain me by thinking  that person  to blame  and
saying your opinion of him is sunk  we must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured  we must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect  it is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us  women fancy admiration means more than
it does  

 and men take care that they should  

 if it is designedly done  they cannot be justified  but i have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine  

 i am far from attributing any part of mr  bingley   conduct to design  
said elizabeth   but without scheming to do wrong  or to make others
unhappy  there may be error  and there may be misery  thoughtlessness 
want of attention to other people   feelings  and want of resolution 
will do the business  

 and do you impute it to either of those  

 yes  to the last  but if i go on  i shall displease you by saying what
i think of persons you esteem  stop me whilst you can  

 you persist  then  in supposing his sisters influence him  

 yes  in conjunction with his friend  

 i cannot believe it  why should they try to influence him  they can
only wish his happiness  and if he is attached to me  no other woman can
secure it  

 your first position is false  they may wish many things besides his
happiness  they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence  they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money  great
connections  and pride  

 beyond a doubt  they  do  wish him to choose miss darcy   replied jane 
 but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing  they have
known her much longer than they have known me  no wonder if they love
her better  but  whatever may be their own wishes  it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother    what sister would think
herself at liberty to do it  unless there were something very
objectionable  if they believed him attached to me  they would not try
to part us  if he were so  they could not succeed  by supposing such an
affection  you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong  and me most
unhappy  do not distress me by the idea  i am not ashamed of having been
mistaken  or  at least  it is light  it is nothing in comparison of what
i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters  let me take it in
the best light  in the light in which it may be understood  

elizabeth could not oppose such a wish  and from this time mr  bingley  
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them 

mrs  bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more  and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account
for it clearly  there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity  her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself  that his attentions to jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking  which ceased when he saw her
no more  but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time  she had the same story to repeat every day  mrs  bennet   best
comfort was that mr  bingley must be down again in the summer 

mr  bennet treated the matter differently   so  lizzy   said he one day 
 your sister is crossed in love  i find  i congratulate her  next to
being married  a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then 
it is something to think of  and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions  when is your turn to come  you will hardly bear to
be long outdone by jane  now is your time  here are officers enough in
meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country  let wickham
be  your  man  he is a pleasant fellow  and would jilt you creditably  

 thank you  sir  but a less agreeable man would satisfy me  we must not
all expect jane   good fortune  

 true   said mr  bennet   but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you  you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it  

mr  wickham   society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn
family  they saw him often  and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve  the whole of what elizabeth had already
heard  his claims on mr  darcy  and all that he had suffered from him 
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed  and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr  darcy before they
had known anything of the matter 

miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case  unknown to the society
of hertfordshire  her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances  and urged the possibility of mistakes  but by everybody else
mr  darcy was condemned as the worst of men 



chapter 25


after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity 
mr  collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of
saturday  the pain of separation  however  might be alleviated on his
side  by preparations for the reception of his bride  as he had reason
to hope  that shortly after his return into hertfordshire  the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men  he took leave of his
relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before  wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again  and promised their father another
letter of thanks 

on the following monday  mrs  bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife  who came as usual to spend the christmas
at longbourn  mr  gardiner was a sensible  gentlemanlike man  greatly
superior to his sister  as well by nature as education  the netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade  and within view of his own warehouses  could have been so
well bred and agreeable  mrs  gardiner  who was several years younger
than mrs  bennet and mrs  phillips  was an amiable  intelligent  elegant
woman  and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces  between the
two eldest and herself especially  there subsisted a particular regard 
they had frequently been staying with her in town 

the first part of mrs  gardiner   business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions  when this was
done she had a less active part to play  it became her turn to listen 
mrs  bennet had many grievances to relate  and much to complain of  they
had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister  two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage  and after all there was
nothing in it 

 i do not blame jane   she continued   for jane would have got mr 
bingley if she could  but lizzy  oh  sister  it is very hard to think
that she might have been mr  collins   wife by this time  had it not
been for her own perverseness  he made her an offer in this very room 
and she refused him  the consequence of it is  that lady lucas will have
a daughter married before i have  and that the longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever  the lucases are very artful people indeed 
sister  they are all for what they can get  i am sorry to say it of
them  but so it is  it makes me very nervous and poorly  to be thwarted
so in my own family  and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else  however  your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts  and i am very glad to hear what you tell us  of
long sleeves  

mrs  gardiner  to whom the chief of this news had been given before 
in the course of jane and elizabeth   correspondence with her  made her
sister a slight answer  and  in compassion to her nieces  turned the
conversation 

when alone with elizabeth afterwards  she spoke more on the subject   it
seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane   said she   i am
sorry it went off  but these things happen so often  a young man  such
as you describe mr  bingley  so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks  and when accident separates them  so easily forgets
her  that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent  

 an excellent consolation in its way   said elizabeth   but it will not
do for  us   we do not suffer by  accident   it does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before  

 but that expression of  violently in love  is so hackneyed  so
doubtful  so indefinite  that it gives me very little idea  it is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half hour   acquaintance 
as to a real  strong attachment  pray  how  violent was  mr  bingley  
love  

 i never saw a more promising inclination  he was growing quite
inattentive to other people  and wholly engrossed by her  every time
they met  it was more decided and remarkable  at his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies  by not asking them to dance  and i
spoke to him twice myself  without receiving an answer  could there be
finer symptoms  is not general incivility the very essence of love  

 oh  yes   of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt  poor
jane  i am sorry for her  because  with her disposition  she may not get
over it immediately  it had better have happened to  you   lizzy  you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner  but do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us  change of scene might be
of service  and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything  

elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal  and felt persuaded
of her sister   ready acquiescence 

 i hope   added mrs  gardiner   that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her  we live in so different a part of
town  all our connections are so different  and  as you well know  we go
out so little  that it is very improbable that they should meet at all 
unless he really comes to see her  

 and  that  is quite impossible  for he is now in the custody of his
friend  and mr  darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such
a part of london  my dear aunt  how could you think of it  mr  darcy may
perhaps have  heard  of such a place as gracechurch street  but he
would hardly think a month   ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities  were he once to enter it  and depend upon it  mr  bingley
never stirs without him  

 so much the better  i hope they will not meet at all  but does not jane
correspond with his sister   she  will not be able to help calling  

 she will drop the acquaintance entirely  

but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this
point  as well as the still more interesting one of bingley   being
withheld from seeing jane  she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her  on examination  that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless  it was possible  and sometimes she thought it probable  that
his affection might be reanimated  and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of jane  
attractions 

miss bennet accepted her aunt   invitation with pleasure  and the
bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time  than as she
hoped by caroline   not living in the same house with her brother 
she might occasionally spend a morning with her  without any danger of
seeing him 

the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn  and what with the phillipses 
the lucases  and the officers  there was not a day without its
engagement  mrs  bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister  that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner  when the engagement was for home  some of the officers always
made part of it  of which officers mr  wickham was sure to be one  and
on these occasions  mrs  gardiner  rendered suspicious by elizabeth  
warm commendation  narrowly observed them both  without supposing them 
from what she saw  to be very seriously in love  their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy  and
she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left
hertfordshire  and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment 

to mrs  gardiner  wickham had one means of affording pleasure 
unconnected with his general powers  about ten or a dozen years ago 
before her marriage  she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of derbyshire to which he belonged  they had  therefore  many
acquaintances in common  and though wickham had been little there since
the death of darcy   father  it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring 

mrs  gardiner had seen pemberley  and known the late mr  darcy by
character perfectly well  here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse  in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute
description which wickham could give  and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor  she was delighting both
him and herself  on being made acquainted with the present mr  darcy  
treatment of him  she tried to remember some of that gentleman  
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it  and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr  fitzwilliam
darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud  ill natured boy 



chapter 26


mrs  gardiner   caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone  after
honestly telling her what she thought  she thus went on 

 you are too sensible a girl  lizzy  to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it  and  therefore  i am not afraid of speaking
openly  seriously  i would have you be on your guard  do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent  i have nothing to say against
 him   he is a most interesting young man  and if he had the fortune he
ought to have  i should think you could not do better  but as it is  you
must not let your fancy run away with you  you have sense  and we all
expect you to use it  your father would depend on  your  resolution and
good conduct  i am sure  you must not disappoint your father  

 my dear aunt  this is being serious indeed  

 yes  and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise  

 well  then  you need not be under any alarm  i will take care of
myself  and of mr  wickham too  he shall not be in love with me  if i
can prevent it  

 elizabeth  you are not serious now  

 i beg your pardon  i will try again  at present i am not in love with
mr  wickham  no  i certainly am not  but he is  beyond all comparison 
the most agreeable man i ever saw  and if he becomes really attached to
me  i believe it will be better that he should not  i see the imprudence
of it  oh   that  abominable mr  darcy  my father   opinion of me does
me the greatest honour  and i should be miserable to forfeit it  my
father  however  is partial to mr  wickham  in short  my dear aunt  i
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy  but
since we see every day that where there is affection  young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other  how can i promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow creatures if i am tempted  or how am i even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist  all that i can promise you  therefore  is not
to be in a hurry  i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object  when i am in company with him  i will not be wishing  in short 
i will do my best  

 perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often  at least  you should not  remind  your mother of inviting him  

 as i did the other day   said elizabeth with a conscious smile   very
true  it will be wise in me to refrain from  that   but do not imagine
that he is always here so often  it is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week  you know my mother   ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends  but really  and upon my
honour  i will try to do what i think to be the wisest  and now i hope
you are satisfied  

her aunt assured her that she was  and elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints  they parted  a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point  without being resented 

mr  collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the gardiners and jane  but as he took up his abode with the lucases 
his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs  bennet  his marriage was
now fast approaching  and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable  and even repeatedly to say  in an ill natured tone  that
she   wished  they might be happy   thursday was to be the wedding day 
and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit  and when she
rose to take leave  elizabeth  ashamed of her mother   ungracious and
reluctant good wishes  and sincerely affected herself  accompanied her
out of the room  as they went downstairs together  charlotte said 

 i shall depend on hearing from you very often  eliza  

  that  you certainly shall  

 and i have another favour to ask you  will you come and see me  

 we shall often meet  i hope  in hertfordshire  

 i am not likely to leave kent for some time  promise me  therefore  to
come to hunsford  

elizabeth could not refuse  though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit 

 my father and maria are coming to me in march   added charlotte   and i
hope you will consent to be of the party  indeed  eliza  you will be as
welcome as either of them  

the wedding took place  the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from
the church door  and everybody had as much to say  or to hear  on
the subject as usual  elizabeth soon heard from her friend  and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been  that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible  elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over 
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent  it was for the
sake of what had been  rather than what was  charlotte   first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness  there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home  how she would
like lady catherine  and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be  though  when the letters were read  elizabeth felt that charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen  she
wrote cheerfully  seemed surrounded with comforts  and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise  the house  furniture  neighbourhood  and
roads  were all to her taste  and lady catherine   behaviour was most
friendly and obliging  it was mr  collins   picture of hunsford and
rosings rationally softened  and elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest 

jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in london  and when she wrote again  elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the bingleys 

her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is  jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from caroline  she accounted for it  however  by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been
lost 

 my aunt   she continued   is going to morrow into that part of the
town  and i shall take the opportunity of calling in grosvenor street  

she wrote again when the visit was paid  and she had seen miss bingley 
 i did not think caroline in spirits   were her words   but she was very
glad to see me  and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to london  i was right  therefore  my last letter had never reached
her  i inquired after their brother  of course  he was well  but so much
engaged with mr  darcy that they scarcely ever saw him  i found that
miss darcy was expected to dinner  i wish i could see her  my visit was
not long  as caroline and mrs  hurst were going out  i dare say i shall
see them soon here  

elizabeth shook her head over this letter  it convinced her that
accident only could discover to mr  bingley her sister   being in town 

four weeks passed away  and jane saw nothing of him  she endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it  but she could no longer be
blind to miss bingley   inattention  after waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight  and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her  the
visitor did at last appear  but the shortness of her stay  and yet more 
the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no
longer  the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt 

 my dearest lizzy will  i am sure  be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement  at my expense  when i confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in miss bingley   regard for me  but  my dear sister 
though the event has proved you right  do not think me obstinate if i
still assert that  considering what her behaviour was  my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion  i do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me  but if the same circumstances were to
happen again  i am sure i should be deceived again  caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday  and not a note  not a line  did i
receive in the meantime  when she did come  it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it  she made a slight  formal apology  for not
calling before  said not a word of wishing to see me again  and was
in every respect so altered a creature  that when she went away i was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer  i pity 
though i cannot help blaming her  she was very wrong in singling me out
as she did  i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side  but i pity her  because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong  and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it  i need not explain myself farther  and though  we  know
this anxiety to be quite needless  yet if she feels it  it will easily
account for her behaviour to me  and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister  whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable  i cannot but wonder  however  at her having any such fears now 
because  if he had at all cared about me  we must have met  long ago 
he knows of my being in town  i am certain  from something she said
herself  and yet it would seem  by her manner of talking  as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy  i
cannot understand it  if i were not afraid of judging harshly  i should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this  but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought 
and think only of what will make me happy  your affection  and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt  let me hear from you very
soon  miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield
again  of giving up the house  but not with any certainty  we had better
not mention it  i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at hunsford  pray go to see them  with sir william and
maria  i am sure you will be very comfortable there   yours  etc  

this letter gave elizabeth some pain  but her spirits returned as she
considered that jane would no longer be duped  by the sister at least 
all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over  she would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions  his character sunk on
every review of it  and as a punishment for him  as well as a possible
advantage to jane  she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr 
darcy   sister  as by wickham   account  she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away 

mrs  gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman  and required information  and elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself  his apparent partiality had subsided  his attentions were over 
he was the admirer of some one else  elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all  but she could see it and write of it without material pain 
her heart had been but slightly touched  and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that  she  would have been his only choice  had fortune
permitted it  the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable  but elizabeth  less clear sighted perhaps in this case than
in charlotte    did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence 
nothing  on the contrary  could be more natural  and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her  she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both  and could very
sincerely wish him happy 

all this was acknowledged to mrs  gardiner  and after relating the
circumstances  she thus went on   i am now convinced  my dear aunt  that
i have never been much in love  for had i really experienced that pure
and elevating passion  i should at present detest his very name  and
wish him all manner of evil  but my feelings are not only cordial
towards  him   they are even impartial towards miss king  i cannot find
out that i hate her at all  or that i am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl  there can be no love in all this  my
watchfulness has been effectual  and though i certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love
with him  i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance 
importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly  kitty and lydia take
his defection much more to heart than i do  they are young in the
ways of the world  and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain  



chapter 27


with no greater events than these in the longbourn family  and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton  sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold  did january and february pass away  march was to take
elizabeth to hunsford  she had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither  but charlotte  she soon found  was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty  absence had increased her desire of seeing
charlotte again  and weakened her disgust of mr  collins  there
was novelty in the scheme  and as  with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters  home could not be faultless  a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake  the journey would moreover give her
a peep at jane  and  in short  as the time drew near  she would have
been very sorry for any delay  everything  however  went on smoothly 
and was finally settled according to charlotte   first sketch  she was
to accompany sir william and his second daughter  the improvement
of spending a night in london was added in time  and the plan became
perfect as plan could be 

the only pain was in leaving her father  who would certainly miss her 
and who  when it came to the point  so little liked her going  that he
told her to write to him  and almost promised to answer her letter 

the farewell between herself and mr  wickham was perfectly friendly  on
his side even more  his present pursuit could not make him forget that
elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention  the
first to listen and to pity  the first to be admired  and in his manner
of bidding her adieu  wishing her every enjoyment  reminding her of
what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh  and trusting their
opinion of her  their opinion of everybody  would always coincide  there
was a solicitude  an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard  and she parted from him convinced that 
whether married or single  he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing 

her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable  sir william lucas  and his daughter maria  a
good humoured girl  but as empty headed as himself  had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing  and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise  elizabeth loved absurdities  but
she had known sir william   too long  he could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood  and his civilities were
worn out  like his information 

it was a journey of only twenty four miles  and they began it so early
as to be in gracechurch street by noon  as they drove to mr  gardiner  
door  jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival  when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them  and elizabeth 
looking earnestly in her face  was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever  on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls 
whose eagerness for their cousin   appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing room  and whose shyness  as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth  prevented their coming lower  all was joy and
kindness  the day passed most pleasantly away  the morning in bustle and
shopping  and the evening at one of the theatres 

elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt  their first object was her
sister  and she was more grieved than astonished to hear  in reply to
her minute inquiries  that though jane always struggled to support her
spirits  there were periods of dejection  it was reasonable  however 
to hope that they would not continue long  mrs  gardiner gave her the
particulars also of miss bingley   visit in gracechurch street  and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and
herself  which proved that the former had  from her heart  given up the
acquaintance 

mrs  gardiner then rallied her niece on wickham   desertion  and
complimented her on bearing it so well 

 but my dear elizabeth   she added   what sort of girl is miss king  i
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary  

 pray  my dear aunt  what is the difference in matrimonial affairs 
between the mercenary and the prudent motive  where does discretion end 
and avarice begin  last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me 
because it would be imprudent  and now  because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds  you want to find out that he is
mercenary  

 if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is  i shall know
what to think  

 she is a very good kind of girl  i believe  i know no harm of her  

 but he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather   death
made her mistress of this fortune  

 no  why should he  if it were not allowable for him to gain  my 
affections because i had no money  what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about  and who was equally
poor  

 but there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event  

 a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe  if  she  does not object to it 
why should  we   

  her  not objecting does not justify  him   it only shows her being
deficient in something herself  sense or feeling  

 well   cried elizabeth   have it as you choose   he  shall be
mercenary  and  she  shall be foolish  

 no  lizzy  that is what i do  not  choose  i should be sorry  you know 
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in derbyshire  

 oh  if that is all  i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
derbyshire  and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not
much better  i am sick of them all  thank heaven  i am going to morrow
where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality  who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him  stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing  after all  

 take care  lizzy  that speech savours strongly of disappointment  

before they were separated by the conclusion of the play  she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer 

 we have not determined how far it shall carry us   said mrs  gardiner 
 but  perhaps  to the lakes  

no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth  and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful   oh  my dear 
dear aunt   she rapturously cried   what delight  what felicity  you
give me fresh life and vigour  adieu to disappointment and spleen  what
are young men to rocks and mountains  oh  what hours of transport
we shall spend  and when we  do  return  it shall not be like other
travellers  without being able to give one accurate idea of anything  we
 will  know where we have gone  we  will  recollect what we have seen 
lakes  mountains  and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations  nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene 
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation  let  our 
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers  



chapter 28


every object in the next day   journey was new and interesting to
elizabeth  and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment  for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health 
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight 

when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford  every eye was in
search of the parsonage  and every turning expected to bring it in view 
the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side  elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants 

at length the parsonage was discernible  the garden sloping to the
road  the house standing in it  the green pales  and the laurel hedge 
everything declared they were arriving  mr  collins and charlotte
appeared at the door  and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house  amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party  in a moment they were all out of the chaise  rejoicing
at the sight of each other  mrs  collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure  and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received  she saw
instantly that her cousin   manners were not altered by his marriage 
his formal civility was just what it had been  and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family  they were then  with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance  taken into the house  and as soon as they
were in the parlour  he welcomed them a second time  with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode  and punctually repeated all his wife  
offers of refreshment 

elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory  and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room  its
aspect and its furniture  he addressed himself particularly to her 
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him  but
though everything seemed neat and comfortable  she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance  and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion 
when mr  collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed  which certainly was not unseldom  she involuntarily turned her
eye on charlotte  once or twice she could discern a faint blush  but
in general charlotte wisely did not hear  after sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room  from the sideboard to
the fender  to give an account of their journey  and of all that had
happened in london  mr  collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden  which was large and well laid out  and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself  to work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures  and elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise  and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible  here  leading the way
through every walk and cross walk  and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for  every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind  he could number the
fields in every direction  and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump  but of all the views which his garden  or which
the country or kingdom could boast  none were to be compared with the
prospect of rosings  afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house  it was a handsome
modern building  well situated on rising ground 

from his garden  mr  collins would have led them round his two meadows 
but the ladies  not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost  turned back  and while sir william accompanied him  charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house  extremely well pleased 
probably  to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband  
help  it was rather small  but well built and convenient  and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit  when mr  collins could be
forgotten  there was really an air of great comfort throughout  and by
charlotte   evident enjoyment of it  elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten 

she had already learnt that lady catherine was still in the country  it
was spoken of again while they were at dinner  when mr  collins joining
in  observed 

 yes  miss elizabeth  you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine
de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church  and i need not say you will
be delighted with her  she is all affability and condescension  and i
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over  i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here  her behaviour to my dear charlotte is
charming  we dine at rosings twice every week  and are never allowed
to walk home  her ladyship   carriage is regularly ordered for us  i
 should  say  one of her ladyship   carriages  for she has several  

 lady catherine is a very respectable  sensible woman indeed   added
charlotte   and a most attentive neighbour  

 very true  my dear  that is exactly what i say  she is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference  

the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news 
and telling again what had already been written  and when it closed 
elizabeth  in the solitude of her chamber  had to meditate upon
charlotte   degree of contentment  to understand her address in guiding 
and composure in bearing with  her husband  and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well  she had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass  the quiet tenor of their usual employments  the vexatious
interruptions of mr  collins  and the gaieties of their intercourse with
rosings  a lively imagination soon settled it all 

about the middle of the next day  as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk  a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion  and  after listening a moment  she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry  and calling loudly after her  she opened
the door and met maria in the landing place  who  breathless with
agitation  cried out  

 oh  my dear eliza  pray make haste and come into the dining room  for
there is such a sight to be seen  i will not tell you what it is  make
haste  and come down this moment  

elizabeth asked questions in vain  maria would tell her nothing more 
and down they ran into the dining room  which fronted the lane  in
quest of this wonder  it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate 

 and is this all   cried elizabeth   i expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden  and here is nothing but lady catherine and her
daughter  

 la  my dear   said maria  quite shocked at the mistake   it is not
lady catherine  the old lady is mrs  jenkinson  who lives with them 
the other is miss de bourgh  only look at her  she is quite a little
creature  who would have thought that she could be so thin and small  

 she is abominably rude to keep charlotte out of doors in all this wind 
why does she not come in  

 oh  charlotte says she hardly ever does  it is the greatest of favours
when miss de bourgh comes in  

 i like her appearance   said elizabeth  struck with other ideas   she
looks sickly and cross  yes  she will do for him very well  she will
make him a very proper wife  

mr  collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies  and sir william  to elizabeth   high diversion  was
stationed in the doorway  in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him  and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that
way 

at length there was nothing more to be said  the ladies drove on  and
the others returned into the house  mr  collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune  which
charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at rosings the next day 



chapter 29


mr  collins   triumph  in consequence of this invitation  was complete 
the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors  and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife  was exactly what he had wished for  and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon  was such an instance of lady
catherine   condescension  as he knew not how to admire enough 

 i confess   said he   that i should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship   asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
rosings  i rather expected  from my knowledge of her affability  that it
would happen  but who could have foreseen such an attention as this  who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
 an invitation  moreover  including the whole party  so immediately
after your arrival  

 i am the less surprised at what has happened   replied sir william 
 from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are  which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire  about the court  such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon  

scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to rosings  mr  collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect  that the sight of such rooms  so many servants  and
so splendid a dinner  might not wholly overpower them 

when the ladies were separating for the toilette  he said to elizabeth  

 do not make yourself uneasy  my dear cousin  about your apparel  lady
catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter  i would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest  there is no occasion
for anything more  lady catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed  she likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved  

while they were dressing  he came two or three times to their different
doors  to recommend their being quick  as lady catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner  such formidable accounts of
her ladyship  and her manner of living  quite frightened maria lucas
who had been little used to company  and she looked forward to her
introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at st  james   

as the weather was fine  they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park  every park has its beauty and its prospects  and
elizabeth saw much to be pleased with  though she could not be in such
raptures as mr  collins expected the scene to inspire  and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house  and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost sir lewis de bourgh 

when they ascended the steps to the hall  maria   alarm was every
moment increasing  and even sir william did not look perfectly calm 
elizabeth   courage did not fail her  she had heard nothing of lady
catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue  and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation 

from the entrance hall  of which mr  collins pointed out  with a
rapturous air  the fine proportion and the finished ornaments  they
followed the servants through an ante chamber  to the room where lady
catherine  her daughter  and mrs  jenkinson were sitting  her ladyship 
with great condescension  arose to receive them  and as mrs  collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers  it was performed in a proper manner  without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary 

in spite of having been at st  james   sir william was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him  that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow  and take his seat without saying a word 
and his daughter  frightened almost out of her senses  sat on the edge
of her chair  not knowing which way to look  elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene  and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly  lady catherine was a tall  large woman  with strongly marked
features  which might once have been handsome  her air was not
conciliating  nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank  she was not rendered formidable by
silence  but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone 
as marked her self importance  and brought mr  wickham immediately to
elizabeth   mind  and from the observation of the day altogether  she
believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented 

when  after examining the mother  in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of mr  darcy  she turned her eyes on the
daughter  she could almost have joined in maria   astonishment at her
being so thin and so small  there was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies  miss de bourgh was pale and sickly  her
features  though not plain  were insignificant  and she spoke very
little  except in a low voice  to mrs  jenkinson  in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable  and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said  and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes 

after sitting a few minutes  they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view  mr  collins attending them to point out its beauties 
and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer 

the dinner was exceedingly handsome  and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which mr  collins had promised  and  as he had
likewise foretold  he took his seat at the bottom of the table  by her
ladyship   desire  and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater  he carved  and ate  and praised with delighted
alacrity  and every dish was commended  first by him and then by sir
william  who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law
said  in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear 
but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration  and
gave most gracious smiles  especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them  the party did not supply much conversation  elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening  but she was seated
between charlotte and miss de bourgh  the former of whom was engaged in
listening to lady catherine  and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner time  mrs  jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
miss de bourgh ate  pressing her to try some other dish  and fearing
she was indisposed  maria thought speaking out of the question  and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire 

when the ladies returned to the drawing room  there was little to
be done but to hear lady catherine talk  which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in  delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner  as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted  she inquired into charlotte   domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely  gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all  told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers  and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry  elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady   attention  which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others  in the intervals of her discourse
with mrs  collins  she addressed a variety of questions to maria and
elizabeth  but especially to the latter  of whose connections she knew
the least  and who she observed to mrs  collins was a very genteel 
pretty kind of girl  she asked her  at different times  how many sisters
she had  whether they were older or younger than herself  whether any of
them were likely to be married  whether they were handsome  where they
had been educated  what carriage her father kept  and what had been
her mother   maiden name  elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly  lady catherine then
observed 

 your father   estate is entailed on mr  collins  i think  for your
sake   turning to charlotte   i am glad of it  but otherwise i see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line  it was not thought
necessary in sir lewis de bourgh   family  do you play and sing  miss
bennet  

 a little  

 oh  then  some time or other we shall be happy to hear you  our
instrument is a capital one  probably superior to    you shall try it
some day  do your sisters play and sing  

 one of them does  

 why did not you all learn  you ought all to have learned  the miss
webbs all play  and their father has not so good an income as yours  do
you draw  

 no  not at all  

 what  none of you  

 not one  

 that is very strange  but i suppose you had no opportunity  your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters  

 my mother would have had no objection  but my father hates london  

 has your governess left you  

 we never had any governess  

 no governess  how was that possible  five daughters brought up at home
without a governess  i never heard of such a thing  your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education  

elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case 

 then  who taught you  who attended to you  without a governess  you
must have been neglected  

 compared with some families  i believe we were  but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means  we were always encouraged to
read  and had all the masters that were necessary  those who chose to be
idle  certainly might  

 aye  no doubt  but that is what a governess will prevent  and if i had
known your mother  i should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one  i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction  and nobody but a governess can give it  it is
wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that
way  i am always glad to get a young person well placed out  four nieces
of mrs  jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means  and
it was but the other day that i recommended another young person 
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me  and the family are quite
delighted with her  mrs  collins  did i tell you of lady metcalf  
calling yesterday to thank me  she finds miss pope a treasure   lady
catherine   said she   you have given me a treasure   are any of your
younger sisters out  miss bennet  

 yes  ma am  all  

 all  what  all five out at once  very odd  and you only the second  the
younger ones out before the elder ones are married  your younger sisters
must be very young  

 yes  my youngest is not sixteen  perhaps  she  is full young to be
much in company  but really  ma am  i think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters  that they should not have their share of society and
amusement  because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early  the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
at the first  and to be kept back on  such  a motive  i think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind  

 upon my word   said her ladyship   you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person  pray  what is your age  

 with three younger sisters grown up   replied elizabeth  smiling   your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it  

lady catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer 
and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence 

 you cannot be more than twenty  i am sure  therefore you need not
conceal your age  

 i am not one and twenty  

when the gentlemen had joined them  and tea was over  the card tables
were placed  lady catherine  sir william  and mr  and mrs  collins sat
down to quadrille  and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino  the
two girls had the honour of assisting mrs  jenkinson to make up her
party  their table was superlatively stupid  scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game  except when mrs  jenkinson
expressed her fears of miss de bourgh   being too hot or too cold  or
having too much or too little light  a great deal more passed at the
other table  lady catherine was generally speaking  stating the mistakes
of the three others  or relating some anecdote of herself  mr  collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said  thanking her
for every fish he won  and apologising if he thought he won too many 
sir william did not say much  he was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names 

when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose 
the tables were broken up  the carriage was offered to mrs  collins 
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered  the party then gathered
round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow  from these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach  and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr 
collins   side and as many bows on sir william   they departed  as soon
as they had driven from the door  elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings  which  for
charlotte   sake  she made more favourable than it really was  but her
commendation  though costing her some trouble  could by no means satisfy
mr  collins  and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship   praise
into his own hands 



chapter 30


sir william stayed only a week at hunsford  but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter   being most comfortably settled 
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with  while sir william was with them  mr  collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig  and showing him the country  but
when he went away  the whole family returned to their usual employments 
and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration  for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing  and looking out of the window in his own book room 
which fronted the road  the room in which the ladies sat was backwards 
elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer
the dining parlour for common use  it was a better sized room  and had a
more pleasant aspect  but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did  for mr  collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment  had they sat in one equally lively  and
she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement 

from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane  and
were indebted to mr  collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along  and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton 
which he never failed coming to inform them of  though it happened
almost every day  she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage  and
had a few minutes  conversation with charlotte  but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out 

very few days passed in which mr  collins did not walk to rosings  and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise 
and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of  she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours  now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship 
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits  she examined into their employments  looked at their work 
and advised them to do it differently  found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture  or detected the housemaid in negligence  and if she
accepted any refreshment  seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that mrs  collins   joints of meat were too large for her family 

elizabeth soon perceived  that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county  she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish  the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by mr  collins  and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome  discontented  or too poor  she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences  silence their complaints  and scold
them into harmony and plenty 

the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week 
and  allowing for the loss of sir william  and there being only one
card table in the evening  every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first  their other engagements were few  as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr  collins   reach  this 
however  was no evil to elizabeth  and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough  there were half hours of pleasant conversation with
charlotte  and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors  her favourite walk  and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine  was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park  where there was
a nice sheltered path  which no one seemed to value but herself  and
where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherine   curiosity 

in this quiet way  the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away 
easter was approaching  and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at rosings  which in so small a circle must be
important  elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr  darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks  and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer  his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties  and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingley   designs on him
were  by his behaviour to his cousin  for whom he was evidently
destined by lady catherine  who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction  spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration  and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
miss lucas and herself 

his arrival was soon known at the parsonage  for mr  collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane 
in order to have the earliest assurance of it  and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the park  hurried home with the great
intelligence  on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his
respects  there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them  for
mr  darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam  the younger son of
his uncle lord       and  to the great surprise of all the party  when
mr  collins returned  the gentlemen accompanied him  charlotte had seen
them from her husband   room  crossing the road  and immediately running
into the other  told the girls what an honour they might expect  adding 

 i may thank you  eliza  for this piece of civility  mr  darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me  

elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment 
before their approach was announced by the door bell  and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room  colonel fitzwilliam 
who led the way  was about thirty  not handsome  but in person and
address most truly the gentleman  mr  darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in hertfordshire  paid his compliments  with his usual
reserve  to mrs  collins  and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend  met her with every appearance of composure  elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word 

colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well bred man  and talked very pleasantly  but
his cousin  after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to mrs  collins  sat for some time without speaking to anybody 
at length  however  his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
elizabeth after the health of her family  she answered him in the usual
way  and after a moment   pause  added 

 my eldest sister has been in town these three months  have you never
happened to see her there  

she was perfectly sensible that he never had  but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the bingleys and jane  and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet  the
subject was pursued no farther  and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away 



chapter 31


colonel fitzwilliam   manners were very much admired at the parsonage 
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at rosings  it was some days  however  before they
received any invitation thither  for while there were visitors in the
house  they could not be necessary  and it was not till easter day 
almost a week after the gentlemen   arrival  that they were honoured by
such an attention  and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening  for the last week they had seen very little
of lady catherine or her daughter  colonel fitzwilliam had called at the
parsonage more than once during the time  but mr  darcy they had seen
only at church 

the invitation was accepted of course  and at a proper hour they joined
the party in lady catherine   drawing room  her ladyship received
them civilly  but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else  and she was  in fact 
almost engrossed by her nephews  speaking to them  especially to darcy 
much more than to any other person in the room 

colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them  anything was a
welcome relief to him at rosings  and mrs  collins   pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much  he now seated himself by her  and
talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire  of travelling and staying
at home  of new books and music  that elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before  and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow  as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself 
as well as of mr  darcy   his  eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity  and that her ladyship  after a
while  shared the feeling  was more openly acknowledged  for she did not
scruple to call out 

 what is that you are saying  fitzwilliam  what is it you are talking
of  what are you telling miss bennet  let me hear what it is  

 we are speaking of music  madam   said he  when no longer able to avoid
a reply 

 of music  then pray speak aloud  it is of all subjects my delight  i
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music 
there are few people in england  i suppose  who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself  or a better natural taste  if i had ever learnt 
i should have been a great proficient  and so would anne  if her health
had allowed her to apply  i am confident that she would have performed
delightfully  how does georgiana get on  darcy  

mr  darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister   proficiency 

 i am very glad to hear such a good account of her   said lady
catherine   and pray tell her from me  that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal  

 i assure you  madam   he replied   that she does not need such advice 
she practises very constantly  

 so much the better  it cannot be done too much  and when i next write
to her  i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account  i often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice  i have told miss bennet several times  that she
will never play really well unless she practises more  and though mrs 
collins has no instrument  she is very welcome  as i have often told
her  to come to rosings every day  and play on the pianoforte in mrs 
jenkinson   room  she would be in nobody   way  you know  in that part
of the house  

mr  darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt   ill breeding  and made
no answer 

when coffee was over  colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having
promised to play to him  and she sat down directly to the instrument  he
drew a chair near her  lady catherine listened to half a song  and then
talked  as before  to her other nephew  till the latter walked away
from her  and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer  
countenance  elizabeth saw what he was doing  and at the first
convenient pause  turned to him with an arch smile  and said 

 you mean to frighten me  mr  darcy  by coming in all this state to hear
me  i will not be alarmed though your sister  does  play so well  there
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others  my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me  

 i shall not say you are mistaken   he replied   because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you  and i have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own  

elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself  and said to
colonel fitzwilliam   your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me  and teach you not to believe a word i say  i am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character  in a part
of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit  indeed  mr  darcy  it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshire  and  give me leave to
say  very impolitic too  for it is provoking me to retaliate  and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear  

 i am not afraid of you   said he  smilingly 

 pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of   cried colonel
fitzwilliam   i should like to know how he behaves among strangers  

 you shall hear then  but prepare yourself for something very dreadful 
the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire  you must know 
was at a ball  and at this ball  what do you think he did  he danced
only four dances  though gentlemen were scarce  and  to my certain
knowledge  more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner  mr  darcy  you cannot deny the fact  

 i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party  

 true  and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room  well  colonel
fitzwilliam  what do i play next  my fingers wait your orders  

 perhaps   said darcy   i should have judged better  had i sought an
introduction  but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers  

 shall we ask your cousin the reason of this   said elizabeth  still
addressing colonel fitzwilliam   shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education  and who has lived in the world  is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers  

 i can answer your question   said fitzwilliam   without applying to
him  it is because he will not give himself the trouble  

 i certainly have not the talent which some people possess   said darcy 
 of conversing easily with those i have never seen before  i cannot
catch their tone of conversation  or appear interested in their
concerns  as i often see done  

 my fingers   said elizabeth   do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which i see so many women   do  they have not the same
force or rapidity  and do not produce the same expression  but then i
have always supposed it to be my own fault  because i will not take the
trouble of practising  it is not that i do not believe  my  fingers as
capable as any other woman   of superior execution  

darcy smiled and said   you are perfectly right  you have employed your
time much better  no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting  we neither of us perform to strangers  

here they were interrupted by lady catherine  who called out to know
what they were talking of  elizabeth immediately began playing again 
lady catherine approached  and  after listening for a few minutes  said
to darcy 

 miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more  and
could have the advantage of a london master  she has a very good notion
of fingering  though her taste is not equal to anne    anne would have
been a delightful performer  had her health allowed her to learn  

elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin   praise  but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love  and from the whole of his behaviour to miss
de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley  that he might have
been just as likely to marry  her   had she been his relation 

lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeth   performance  mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste  elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility  and  at the request of the
gentlemen  remained at the instrument till her ladyship   carriage was
ready to take them all home 



chapter 32


elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning  and writing to jane
while mrs  collins and maria were gone on business into the village 
when she was startled by a ring at the door  the certain signal of a
visitor  as she had heard no carriage  she thought it not unlikely to
be lady catherine  and under that apprehension was putting away her
half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions 
when the door opened  and  to her very great surprise  mr  darcy  and
mr  darcy only  entered the room 

he seemed astonished too on finding her alone  and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within 

they then sat down  and when her inquiries after rosings were made 
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence  it was absolutely
necessary  therefore  to think of something  and in this emergence
recollecting  when  she had seen him last in hertfordshire  and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure  she observed 

 how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november  mr  darcy 
it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr  bingley to see you
all after him so soon  for  if i recollect right  he went but the day
before  he and his sisters were well  i hope  when you left london  

 perfectly so  i thank you  

she found that she was to receive no other answer  and  after a short
pause added 

 i think i have understood that mr  bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to netherfield again  

 i have never heard him say so  but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future  he has many friends  and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing  

 if he means to be but little at netherfield  it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely  for then we
might possibly get a settled family there  but  perhaps  mr  bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own  and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle  

 i should not be surprised   said darcy   if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers  

elizabeth made no answer  she was afraid of talking longer of his
friend  and  having nothing else to say  was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him 

he took the hint  and soon began with   this seems a very comfortable
house  lady catherine  i believe  did a great deal to it when mr 
collins first came to hunsford  

 i believe she did  and i am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object  

 mr  collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife  

 yes  indeed  his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him  or have made
him happy if they had  my friend has an excellent understanding  though
i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr  collins as the
wisest thing she ever did  she seems perfectly happy  however  and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her  

 it must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends  

 an easy distance  do you call it  it is nearly fifty miles  

 and what is fifty miles of good road  little more than half a day  
journey  yes  i call it a  very  easy distance  

 i should never have considered the distance as one of the  advantages 
of the match   cried elizabeth   i should never have said mrs  collins
was settled  near  her family  

 it is a proof of your own attachment to hertfordshire  anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of longbourn  i suppose  would appear far  

as he spoke there was a sort of smile which elizabeth fancied she
understood  he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and
netherfield  and she blushed as she answered 

 i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family  the far and the near must be relative  and depend on many
varying circumstances  where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant  distance becomes no evil  but that is not the
case  here   mr  and mrs  collins have a comfortable income  but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys  and i am persuaded my
friend would not call herself  near  her family under less than  half 
the present distance  

mr  darcy drew his chair a little towards her  and said    you  cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment   you  cannot have
been always at longbourn  

elizabeth looked surprised  the gentleman experienced some change of
feeling  he drew back his chair  took a newspaper from the table  and
glancing over it  said  in a colder voice 

 are you pleased with kent  

a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued  on either side
calm and concise  and soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte
and her sister  just returned from her walk  the tete a tete surprised
them  mr  darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on miss bennet  and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody  went away 

 what can be the meaning of this   said charlotte  as soon as he was
gone   my dear  eliza  he must be in love with you  or he would never
have called us in this familiar way  

but when elizabeth told of his silence  it did not seem very likely 
even to charlotte   wishes  to be the case  and after various
conjectures  they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do  which was the more probable
from the time of year  all field sports were over  within doors there
was lady catherine  books  and a billiard table  but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors  and in the nearness of the parsonage  or the
pleasantness of the walk to it  or of the people who lived in it  the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day  they called at various times of the morning  sometimes
separately  sometimes together  and now and then accompanied by their
aunt  it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society  a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more  and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him  as well as by his evident admiration of her  of her
former favourite george wickham  and though  in comparing them  she saw
there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliam   manners 
she believed he might have the best informed mind 

but why mr  darcy came so often to the parsonage  it was more difficult
to understand  it could not be for society  as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips  and when he did speak 
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice  a sacrifice
to propriety  not a pleasure to himself  he seldom appeared really
animated  mrs  collins knew not what to make of him  colonel
fitzwilliam   occasionally laughing at his stupidity  proved that he was
generally different  which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her  and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love  and the object of that love her friend eliza  she set herself
seriously to work to find it out  she watched him whenever they were at
rosings  and whenever he came to hunsford  but without much success  he
certainly looked at her friend a great deal  but the expression of that
look was disputable  it was an earnest  steadfast gaze  but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it  and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind 

she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her  but elizabeth always laughed at the idea  and mrs 
collins did not think it right to press the subject  from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment  for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt  that all her friend   dislike would
vanish  if she could suppose him to be in her power 


in her kind schemes for elizabeth  she sometimes planned her marrying
colonel fitzwilliam  he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man  he
certainly admired her  and his situation in life was most eligible  but 
to counterbalance these advantages  mr  darcy had considerable patronage
in the church  and his cousin could have none at all 



chapter 33


more than once did elizabeth  in her ramble within the park 
unexpectedly meet mr  darcy  she felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought  and  to
prevent its ever happening again  took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers  how it could occur a second time 
therefore  was very odd  yet it did  and even a third  it seemed like
wilful ill nature  or a voluntary penance  for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away 
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her  he
never said a great deal  nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much  but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions  about
her pleasure in being at hunsford  her love of solitary walks  and her
opinion of mr  and mrs  collins   happiness  and that in speaking of
rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house  he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying
 there  too  his words seemed to imply it  could he have colonel
fitzwilliam in his thoughts  she supposed  if he meant anything  he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter  it distressed
her a little  and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the parsonage 

she was engaged one day as she walked  in perusing jane   last letter 
and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in
spirits  when  instead of being again surprised by mr  darcy  she saw
on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her  putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile  she said 

 i did not know before that you ever walked this way  

 i have been making the tour of the park   he replied   as i generally
do every year  and intend to close it with a call at the parsonage  are
you going much farther  

 no  i should have turned in a moment  

and accordingly she did turn  and they walked towards the parsonage
together 

 do you certainly leave kent on saturday   said she 

 yes  if darcy does not put it off again  but i am at his disposal  he
arranges the business just as he pleases  

 and if not able to please himself in the arrangement  he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice  i do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr  darcy  

 he likes to have his own way very well   replied colonel fitzwilliam 
 but so we all do  it is only that he has better means of having it
than many others  because he is rich  and many others are poor  i speak
feelingly  a younger son  you know  must be inured to self denial and
dependence  

 in my opinion  the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either  now seriously  what have you ever known of self denial and
dependence  when have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose  or procuring anything you had a fancy for  

 these are home questions  and perhaps i cannot say that i have
experienced many hardships of that nature  but in matters of greater
weight  i may suffer from want of money  younger sons cannot marry where
they like  

 unless where they like women of fortune  which i think they very often
do  

 our habits of expense make us too dependent  and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money  

 is this   thought elizabeth   meant for me   and she coloured at the
idea  but  recovering herself  said in a lively tone   and pray  what
is the usual price of an earl   younger son  unless the elder brother is
very sickly  i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds  

he answered her in the same style  and the subject dropped  to interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed 
she soon afterwards said 

 i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal  i wonder he does not marry  to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind  but  perhaps  his sister does as well
for the present  and  as she is under his sole care  he may do what he
likes with her  

 no   said colonel fitzwilliam   that is an advantage which he must
divide with me  i am joined with him in the guardianship of miss darcy  

 are you indeed  and pray what sort of guardians do you make  does your
charge give you much trouble  young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage  and if she has the true darcy spirit  she
may like to have her own way  

as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly  and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness  convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth  she directly replied 

 you need not be frightened  i never heard any harm of her  and i dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world  she is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance  mrs  hurst and
miss bingley  i think i have heard you say that you know them  

 i know them a little  their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man  he
is a great friend of darcy    

 oh  yes   said elizabeth drily   mr  darcy is uncommonly kind to mr 
bingley  and takes a prodigious deal of care of him  

 care of him  yes  i really believe darcy  does  take care of him in
those points where he most wants care  from something that he told me in
our journey hither  i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to
him  but i ought to beg his pardon  for i have no right to suppose that
bingley was the person meant  it was all conjecture  

 what is it you mean  

 it is a circumstance which darcy could not wish to be generally known 
because if it were to get round to the lady   family  it would be an
unpleasant thing  

 you may depend upon my not mentioning it  

 and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be
bingley  what he told me was merely this  that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage  but without mentioning names or any other
particulars  and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort  and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer  

 did mr  darcy give you reasons for this interference  

 i understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady  

 and what arts did he use to separate them  

 he did not talk to me of his own arts   said fitzwilliam  smiling   he
only told me what i have now told you  

elizabeth made no answer  and walked on  her heart swelling with
indignation  after watching her a little  fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful 

 i am thinking of what you have been telling me   said she   your
cousin   conduct does not suit my feelings  why was he to be the judge  

 you are rather disposed to call his interference officious  

 i do not see what right mr  darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend   inclination  or why  upon his own judgement alone  he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy 
but   she continued  recollecting herself   as we know none of the
particulars  it is not fair to condemn him  it is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case  

 that is not an unnatural surmise   said fitzwilliam   but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin   triumph very sadly  

this was spoken jestingly  but it appeared to her so just a picture
of mr  darcy  that she would not trust herself with an answer  and
therefore  abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the parsonage  there  shut into her own room 
as soon as their visitor left them  she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard  it was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected  there
could not exist in the world  two  men over whom mr  darcy could have
such boundless influence  that he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted  but she had
always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them  if his own vanity  however  did not mislead him   he  was
the cause  his pride and caprice were the cause  of all that jane had
suffered  and still continued to suffer  he had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate  generous heart in the
world  and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted 

 there were some very strong objections against the lady   were colonel
fitzwilliam   words  and those strong objections probably were  her
having one uncle who was a country attorney  and another who was in
business in london 

 to jane herself   she exclaimed   there could be no possibility of
objection  all loveliness and goodness as she is   her understanding
excellent  her mind improved  and her manners captivating  neither
could anything be urged against my father  who  though with some
peculiarities  has abilities mr  darcy himself need not disdain  and
respectability which he will probably never reach   when she thought of
her mother  her confidence gave way a little  but she would not allow
that any objections  there  had material weight with mr  darcy  whose
pride  she was convinced  would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend   connections  than from their want of sense 
and she was quite decided  at last  that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride  and partly by the wish of retaining mr 
bingley for his sister 

the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned  brought on a
headache  and it grew so much worse towards the evening  that  added to
her unwillingness to see mr  darcy  it determined her not to attend her
cousins to rosings  where they were engaged to drink tea  mrs  collins 
seeing that she was really unwell  did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her  but mr  collins
could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherine   being rather
displeased by her staying at home 



chapter 34


when they were gone  elizabeth  as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against mr  darcy  chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her
being in kent  they contained no actual complaint  nor was there any
revival of past occurrences  or any communication of present suffering 
but in all  and in almost every line of each  there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style  and which 
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone  had been scarcely ever clouded  elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness  with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal  mr  darcy  
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict  gave her
a keener sense of her sister   sufferings  it was some consolation
to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the
next  and  a still greater  that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with jane again  and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits  by all that affection could do 

she could not think of darcy   leaving kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him  but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all  and agreeable as he was  she did not
mean to be unhappy about him 

while settling this point  she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door bell  and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being colonel fitzwilliam himself  who had once before called late in
the evening  and might now come to inquire particularly after her 
but this idea was soon banished  and her spirits were very differently
affected  when  to her utter amazement  she saw mr  darcy walk into the
room  in an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health  imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better 
she answered him with cold civility  he sat down for a few moments  and
then getting up  walked about the room  elizabeth was surprised  but
said not a word  after a silence of several minutes  he came towards her
in an agitated manner  and thus began 

 in vain i have struggled  it will not do  my feelings will not be
repressed  you must allow me to tell you how ardently i admire and love
you  

elizabeth   astonishment was beyond expression  she stared  coloured 
doubted  and was silent  this he considered sufficient encouragement 
and the avowal of all that he felt  and had long felt for her 
immediately followed  he spoke well  but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed  and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride  his sense of her inferiority  of
its being a degradation  of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination  were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding  but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit 

in spite of her deeply rooted dislike  she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man   affection  and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant  she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive  till  roused to resentment by his subsequent language  she
lost all compassion in anger  she tried  however  to compose herself to
answer him with patience  when he should have done  he concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which  in spite
of all his endeavours  he had found impossible to conquer  and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand  as he said this  she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer  he  spoke  of apprehension and anxiety  but
his countenance expressed real security  such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther  and  when he ceased  the colour rose into her
cheeks  and she said 

 in such cases as this  it is  i believe  the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed  however
unequally they may be returned  it is natural that obligation should
be felt  and if i could  feel  gratitude  i would now thank you  but i
cannot  i have never desired your good opinion  and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly  i am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone  it has been most unconsciously done  however  and i hope will be
of short duration  the feelings which  you tell me  have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard  can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation  

mr  darcy  who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face  seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise  his complexion became pale with anger  and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature  he was struggling for the
appearance of composure  and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it  the pause was to elizabeth   feelings
dreadful  at length  with a voice of forced calmness  he said 

 and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting 
i might  perhaps  wish to be informed why  with so little  endeavour  at
civility  i am thus rejected  but it is of small importance  

 i might as well inquire   replied she   why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me  you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will  against your reason  and even against your character 
was not this some excuse for incivility  if i  was  uncivil  but i have
other provocations  you know i have  had not my feelings decided against
you  had they been indifferent  or had they even been favourable  do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining  perhaps for ever  the happiness of a most
beloved sister  

as she pronounced these words  mr  darcy changed colour  but the emotion
was short  and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued 

 i have every reason in the world to think ill of you  no motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted  there   you dare not 
you cannot deny  that you have been the principal  if not the only means
of dividing them from each other  of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability  and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes  and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind  

she paused  and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse 
he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity 

 can you deny that you have done it   she repeated 

with assumed tranquillity he then replied   i have no wish of denying
that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister  or that i rejoice in my success  towards  him  i have been
kinder than towards myself  

elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection 
but its meaning did not escape  nor was it likely to conciliate her 

 but it is not merely this affair   she continued   on which my dislike
is founded  long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided  your character was unfolded in the recital which i received
many months ago from mr  wickham  on this subject  what can you have to
say  in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself 
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others  

 you take an eager interest in that gentleman   concerns   said darcy 
in a less tranquil tone  and with a heightened colour 

 who that knows what his misfortunes have been  can help feeling an
interest in him  

 his misfortunes   repeated darcy contemptuously   yes  his misfortunes
have been great indeed  

 and of your infliction   cried elizabeth with energy   you have reduced
him to his present state of poverty  comparative poverty  you have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him  you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert  you have done all this 
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule  

 and this   cried darcy  as he walked with quick steps across the room 
 is your opinion of me  this is the estimation in which you hold me 
i thank you for explaining it so fully  my faults  according to this
calculation  are heavy indeed  but perhaps   added he  stopping in
his walk  and turning towards her   these offenses might have been
overlooked  had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design  these
bitter accusations might have been suppressed  had i  with greater
policy  concealed my struggles  and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified  unalloyed inclination  by reason  by
reflection  by everything  but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence 
nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related  they were natural and
just  could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections   to congratulate myself on the hope of relations  whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own  

elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment  yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said 

 you are mistaken  mr  darcy  if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way  than as it spared me the concern
which i might have felt in refusing you  had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner  

she saw him start at this  but he said nothing  and she continued 

 you could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it  

again his astonishment was obvious  and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification  she went on 

 from the very beginning  from the first moment  i may almost say  of
my acquaintance with you  your manners  impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance  your conceit  and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others  were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike  and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the
last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry  

 you have said quite enough  madam  i perfectly comprehend your
feelings  and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been 
forgive me for having taken up so much of your time  and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness  

and with these words he hastily left the room  and elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house 

the tumult of her mind  was now painfully great  she knew not how
to support herself  and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half an hour  her astonishment  as she reflected on what had passed 
was increased by every review of it  that she should receive an offer of
marriage from mr  darcy  that he should have been in love with her for
so many months  so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend   marrying
her sister  and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case  was almost incredible  it was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection  but his pride  his abominable
pride  his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
jane  his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging  though he could
not justify it  and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr 
wickham  his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny  soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited  she continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of lady catherine   carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter charlotte   observation  and hurried her away to her room 



chapter 35


elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes  she could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened  it was impossible to think of anything
else  and  totally indisposed for employment  she resolved  soon after
breakfast  to indulge herself in air and exercise  she was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk  when the recollection of mr  darcy  
sometimes coming there stopped her  and instead of entering the park 
she turned up the lane  which led farther from the turnpike road  the
park paling was still the boundary on one side  and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground 

after walking two or three times along that part of the lane  she was
tempted  by the pleasantness of the morning  to stop at the gates and
look into the park  the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had
made a great difference in the country  and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees  she was on the point of continuing her walk 
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park  he was moving that way  and  fearful of its being mr 
darcy  she was directly retreating  but the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her  and stepping forward with eagerness  pronounced
her name  she had turned away  but on hearing herself called  though
in a voice which proved it to be mr  darcy  she moved again towards the
gate  he had by that time reached it also  and  holding out a letter 
which she instinctively took  said  with a look of haughty composure 
 i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you 
will you do me the honour of reading that letter   and then  with a
slight bow  turned again into the plantation  and was soon out of sight 

with no expectation of pleasure  but with the strongest curiosity 
elizabeth opened the letter  and  to her still increasing wonder 
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper  written
quite through  in a very close hand  the envelope itself was likewise
full  pursuing her way along the lane  she then began it  it was dated
from rosings  at eight o clock in the morning  and was as follows   

 be not alarmed  madam  on receiving this letter  by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you  i write without any
intention of paining you  or humbling myself  by dwelling on wishes
which  for the happiness of both  cannot be too soon forgotten  and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion 
should have been spared  had not my character required it to be written
and read  you must  therefore  pardon the freedom with which i demand
your attention  your feelings  i know  will bestow it unwillingly  but i
demand it of your justice 

 two offenses of a very different nature  and by no means of equal
magnitude  you last night laid to my charge  the first mentioned was 
that  regardless of the sentiments of either  i had detached mr  bingley
from your sister  and the other  that i had  in defiance of various
claims  in defiance of honour and humanity  ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr  wickham  wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth  the acknowledged
favourite of my father  a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage  and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion  would be a depravity  to which the separation of two young
persons  whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks  could
bear no comparison  but from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed  respecting each circumstance  i shall hope
to be in the future secured  when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read  if  in the explanation of them  which
is due to myself  i am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours  i can only say that i am sorry  the necessity
must be obeyed  and further apology would be absurd 

 i had not been long in hertfordshire  before i saw  in common with
others  that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country  but it was not till the evening of the dance
at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment  i had often seen him in love before  at that ball  while i
had the honour of dancing with you  i was first made acquainted  by sir
william lucas   accidental information  that bingley   attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage 
he spoke of it as a certain event  of which the time alone could
be undecided  from that moment i observed my friend   behaviour
attentively  and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss
bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him  your sister i also
watched  her look and manners were open  cheerful  and engaging as ever 
but without any symptom of peculiar regard  and i remained convinced
from the evening   scrutiny  that though she received his attentions
with pleasure  she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment  if  you  have not been mistaken here   i  must have been
in error  your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable  if it be so  if i have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her  your resentment has not been unreasonable  but i shall not
scruple to assert  that the serenity of your sister   countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that  however amiable her temper  her heart was not likely to be
easily touched  that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain  but i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears  i did not believe
her to be indifferent because i wished it  i believed it on impartial
conviction  as truly as i wished it in reason  my objections to the
marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside  in my own case  the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me  but
there were other causes of repugnance  causes which  though still
existing  and existing to an equal degree in both instances  i had
myself endeavoured to forget  because they were not immediately before
me  these causes must be stated  though briefly  the situation of your
mother   family  though objectionable  was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently  so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself  by your three younger sisters  and occasionally even by your
father  pardon me  it pains me to offend you  but amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations  and your displeasure at this
representation of them  let it give you consolation to consider that  to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure 
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister  than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both  i will only say
farther that from what passed that evening  my opinion of all parties
was confirmed  and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before  to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy
connection  he left netherfield for london  on the day following  as
you  i am certain  remember  with the design of soon returning 

 the part which i acted is now to be explained  his sisters  uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own  our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered  and  alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother  we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
london  we accordingly went  and there i readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice  i
described  and enforced them earnestly  but  however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination  i do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage  had it not been
seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving  of your
sister   indifference  he had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere  if not with equal regard  but bingley has great
natural modesty  with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own  to convince him  therefore  that he had deceived himself  was
no very difficult point  to persuade him against returning into
hertfordshire  when that conviction had been given  was scarcely the
work of a moment  i cannot blame myself for having done thus much  there
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not
reflect with satisfaction  it is that i condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister   being in
town  i knew it myself  as it was known to miss bingley  but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it  that they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable  but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger  perhaps this
concealment  this disguise was beneath me  it is done  however  and it
was done for the best  on this subject i have nothing more to say  no
other apology to offer  if i have wounded your sister   feelings  it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient  i have not yet learnt to condemn
them 

 with respect to that other  more weighty accusation  of having injured
mr  wickham  i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family  of what he has  particularly  accused me i
am ignorant  but of the truth of what i shall relate  i can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity 

 mr  wickham is the son of a very respectable man  who had for many
years the management of all the pemberley estates  and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him  and on george wickham  who was his godson  his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed  my father supported him at
school  and afterwards at cambridge  most important assistance  as his
own father  always poor from the extravagance of his wife  would have
been unable to give him a gentleman   education  my father was not only
fond of this young man   society  whose manners were always engaging  he
had also the highest opinion of him  and hoping the church would be
his profession  intended to provide for him in it  as for myself  it is
many  many years since i first began to think of him in a very different
manner  the vicious propensities  the want of principle  which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend  could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself 
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments  which mr 
darcy could not have  here again i shall give you pain  to what degree
you only can tell  but whatever may be the sentiments which mr  wickham
has created  a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character  it adds even another motive 

 my excellent father died about five years ago  and his attachment to
mr  wickham was to the last so steady  that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me  to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow  and if he took orders  desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant  there
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds  his own father did not long
survive mine  and within half a year from these events  mr  wickham
wrote to inform me that  having finally resolved against taking orders 
he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage  in lieu of the preferment  by which he
could not be benefited  he had some intention  he added  of studying
law  and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein  i rather wished  than believed
him to be sincere  but  at any rate  was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal  i knew that mr  wickham ought not to be a clergyman  the
business was therefore soon settled  he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church  were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it  and accepted in return three thousand pounds  all connection
between us seemed now dissolved  i thought too ill of him to invite him
to pemberley  or admit his society in town  in town i believe he chiefly
lived  but his studying the law was a mere pretence  and being now free
from all restraint  his life was a life of idleness and dissipation 
for about three years i heard little of him  but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him  he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation  his circumstances  he assured
me  and i had no difficulty in believing it  were exceedingly bad  he
had found the law a most unprofitable study  and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained  if i would present him to the living in
question  of which he trusted there could be little doubt  as he was
well assured that i had no other person to provide for  and i could not
have forgotten my revered father   intentions  you will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty  or for resisting every
repetition to it  his resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances  and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself  after this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped  how he lived i know not  but
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice 

 i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself 
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being  having said thus much  i feel no doubt of your
secrecy  my sister  who is more than ten years my junior  was left to
the guardianship of my mother   nephew  colonel fitzwilliam  and myself 
about a year ago  she was taken from school  and an establishment formed
for her in london  and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it  to ramsgate  and thither also went mr  wickham  undoubtedly by
design  for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and mrs  younge  in whose character we were most unhappily deceived  and
by her connivance and aid  he so far recommended himself to georgiana 
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child  that she was persuaded to believe herself in love  and
to consent to an elopement  she was then but fifteen  which must be her
excuse  and after stating her imprudence  i am happy to add  that i owed
the knowledge of it to herself  i joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement  and then georgiana  unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father  acknowledged the whole to me  you may imagine what i felt and
how i acted  regard for my sister   credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure  but i wrote to mr  wickham  who left the place
immediately  and mrs  younge was of course removed from her charge  mr 
wickham   chief object was unquestionably my sister   fortune  which
is thirty thousand pounds  but i cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement  his revenge would have
been complete indeed 

 this  madam  is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together  and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false  you will  i hope  acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr 
wickham  i know not in what manner  under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you  but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at  ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either 
detection could not be in your power  and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination 

 you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night  but
i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed  for the truth of everything here related  i can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam  who  from our
near relationship and constant intimacy  and  still more  as one of
the executors of my father   will  has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions  if your abhorrence of  me 
should make  my  assertions valueless  you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin  and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him  i shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning  i will only add  god bless you 

 fitzwilliam darcy 



chapter 36


if elizabeth  when mr  darcy gave her the letter  did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers  she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents  but such as they were  it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them  and what a contrariety of emotion they excited 
her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined  with amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power 
and steadfastly was she persuaded  that he could have no explanation
to give  which a just sense of shame would not conceal  with a strong
prejudice against everything he might say  she began his account of what
had happened at netherfield  she read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension  and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring  was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes  his belief of her sister   insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false  and his account of the real  the worst
objections to the match  made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice  he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her  his style was not penitent  but haughty  it was all pride and
insolence 

but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr  wickham  when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which 
if true  must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth  and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself  her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition 
astonishment  apprehension  and even horror  oppressed her  she wished
to discredit it entirely  repeatedly exclaiming   this must be false 
this cannot be  this must be the grossest falsehood    and when she had
gone through the whole letter  though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two  put it hastily away  protesting that she would not
regard it  that she would never look in it again 

in this perturbed state of mind  with thoughts that could rest on
nothing  she walked on  but it would not do  in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again  and collecting herself as well as she could  she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham  and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence 
the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself  and the kindness of the late mr  darcy  though
she had not before known its extent  agreed equally well with his own
words  so far each recital confirmed the other  but when she came to the
will  the difference was great  what wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory  and as she recalled his very words  it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other  and  for a few moments  she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err  but when she read and re read with the closest attention  the
particulars immediately following of wickham   resigning all pretensions
to the living  of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds  again was she forced to hesitate  she put down
the letter  weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality  deliberated on the probability of each statement  but with
little success  on both sides it was only assertion  again she read
on  but every line proved more clearly that the affair  which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render mr  darcy   conduct in it less than infamous  was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole 

the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
mr  wickham   charge  exceedingly shocked her  the more so  as she could
bring no proof of its injustice  she had never heard of him before his
entrance into the     shire militia  in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who  on meeting him accidentally in town 
had there renewed a slight acquaintance  of his former way of life
nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself  as
to his real character  had information been in her power  she had
never felt a wish of inquiring  his countenance  voice  and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue  she tried
to recollect some instance of goodness  some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence  that might rescue him from the attacks of
mr  darcy  or at least  by the predominance of virtue  atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr  darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years  continuance  but
no such recollection befriended her  she could see him instantly before
her  in every charm of air and address  but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood  and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess  after
pausing on this point a considerable while  she once more continued to
read  but  alas  the story which followed  of his designs on miss
darcy  received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel
fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before  and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam
himself  from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin   affairs  and whose character she had no
reason to question  at one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him  but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application  and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr  darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal  if he had not been well assured of his
cousin   corroboration 

she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between wickham and herself  in their first evening at mr  phillips   
many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory  she was  now 
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger  and
wondered it had escaped her before  she saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done  and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct  she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing mr  darcy  that mr  darcy might leave the country  but that
 he  should stand his ground  yet he had avoided the netherfield ball
the very next week  she remembered also that  till the netherfield
family had quitted the country  he had told his story to no one but
herself  but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed 
that he had then no reserves  no scruples in sinking mr  darcy  
character  though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son 

how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned 
his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary  and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes  but his eagerness to grasp at anything 
his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive  he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune  or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown  every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter  and in farther justification of mr  darcy  she could not
but allow that mr  bingley  when questioned by jane  had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair  that proud and repulsive as
were his manners  she had never  in the whole course of their
acquaintance  an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together  and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways  seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust  anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits  that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued  that even wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother  and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of  some  amiable feeling  that had his
actions been what mr  wickham represented them  so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world  and
that friendship between a person capable of it  and such an amiable man
as mr  bingley  was incomprehensible 

she grew absolutely ashamed of herself  of neither darcy nor wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind  partial  prejudiced 
absurd 

 how despicably i have acted   she cried   i  who have prided myself
on my discernment  i  who have valued myself on my abilities  who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister  and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust  how humiliating is this
discovery  yet  how just a humiliation  had i been in love  i could
not have been more wretchedly blind  but vanity  not love  has been my
folly  pleased with the preference of one  and offended by the neglect
of the other  on the very beginning of our acquaintance  i have courted
prepossession and ignorance  and driven reason away  where either were
concerned  till this moment i never knew myself  

from herself to jane  from jane to bingley  her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that mr  darcy   explanation
 there  had appeared very insufficient  and she read it again  widely
different was the effect of a second perusal  how could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance  which she had been obliged to
give in the other  he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister   attachment  and she could not help remembering what charlotte  
opinion had always been  neither could she deny the justice of his
description of jane  she felt that jane   feelings  though fervent  were
little displayed  and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility 

when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying  yet merited reproach  her sense
of shame was severe  the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial  and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the netherfield ball  and as confirming all his first
disapprobation  could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers 

the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt  it soothed 
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self attracted by the rest of her family  and as she considered
that jane   disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations  and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct  she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before 

after wandering along the lane for two hours  giving way to every
variety of thought  re considering events  determining probabilities 
and reconciling herself  as well as she could  to a change so sudden and
so important  fatigue  and a recollection of her long absence  made
her at length return home  and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual  and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation 

she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each
called during her absence  mr  darcy  only for a few minutes  to take
leave  but that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour  hoping for her return  and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found  elizabeth could but just  affect  concern
in missing him  she really rejoiced at it  colonel fitzwilliam was no
longer an object  she could think only of her letter 



chapter 37


the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning  and mr  collins having
been in waiting near the lodges  to make them his parting obeisance  was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence  of their appearing in very
good health  and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected  after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings  to rosings he then
hastened  to console lady catherine and her daughter  and on his return
brought back  with great satisfaction  a message from her ladyship 
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her 

elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that  had
she chosen it  she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece  nor could she think  without a smile  of what her
ladyship   indignation would have been   what would she have said  how
would she have behaved   were questions with which she amused herself 

their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party   i assure
you  i feel it exceedingly   said lady catherine   i believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as i do  but i am particularly
attached to these young men  and know them to be so much attached to
me  they were excessively sorry to go  but so they always are  the
dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last  but darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely  more  i think  than last year  his
attachment to rosings certainly increases  

mr  collins had a compliment  and an allusion to throw in here  which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter 

lady catherine observed  after dinner  that miss bennet seemed out of
spirits  and immediately accounting for it by herself  by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon  she added 

 but if that is the case  you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer  mrs  collins will be very glad of your
company  i am sure  

 i am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation   replied
elizabeth   but it is not in my power to accept it  i must be in town
next saturday  

 why  at that rate  you will have been here only six weeks  i expected
you to stay two months  i told mrs  collins so before you came  there
can be no occasion for your going so soon  mrs  bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight  

 but my father cannot  he wrote last week to hurry my return  

 oh  your father of course may spare you  if your mother can  daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father  and if you will stay
another  month  complete  it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as london  for i am going there early in june  for a week  and as
dawson does not object to the barouche box  there will be very good room
for one of you  and indeed  if the weather should happen to be cool  i
should not object to taking you both  as you are neither of you large  

 you are all kindness  madam  but i believe we must abide by our
original plan  

lady catherine seemed resigned   mrs  collins  you must send a servant
with them  you know i always speak my mind  and i cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves  it is highly improper 
you must contrive to send somebody  i have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing  young women should always be properly
guarded and attended  according to their situation in life  when my
niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer  i made a point of her
having two men servants go with her  miss darcy  the daughter of
mr  darcy  of pemberley  and lady anne  could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner  i am excessively attentive to all those
things  you must send john with the young ladies  mrs  collins  i
am glad it occurred to me to mention it  for it would really be
discreditable to  you  to let them go alone  

 my uncle is to send a servant for us  

 oh  your uncle  he keeps a man servant  does he  i am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things  where shall you change horses 
oh  bromley  of course  if you mention my name at the bell  you will be
attended to  

lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey 
and as she did not answer them all herself  attention was necessary 
which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her  or  with a mind so
occupied  she might have forgotten where she was  reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours  whenever she was alone  she gave way to it
as the greatest relief  and not a day went by without a solitary
walk  in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections 

mr  darcy   letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart  she
studied every sentence  and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different  when she remembered the style of his address 
she was still full of indignation  but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him  her anger was turned against
herself  and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion 
his attachment excited gratitude  his general character respect  but she
could not approve him  nor could she for a moment repent her refusal 
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again  in her own past
behaviour  there was a constant source of vexation and regret  and in
the unhappy defects of her family  a subject of yet heavier chagrin 
they were hopeless of remedy  her father  contented with laughing at
them  would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters  and her mother  with manners so far from right
herself  was entirely insensible of the evil  elizabeth had frequently
united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine
and lydia  but while they were supported by their mother   indulgence 
what chance could there be of improvement  catherine  weak spirited 
irritable  and completely under lydia   guidance  had been always
affronted by their advice  and lydia  self willed and careless  would
scarcely give them a hearing  they were ignorant  idle  and vain  while
there was an officer in meryton  they would flirt with him  and while
meryton was within a walk of longbourn  they would be going there
forever 

anxiety on jane   behalf was another prevailing concern  and mr  darcy  
explanation  by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion 
heightened the sense of what jane had lost  his affection was proved
to have been sincere  and his conduct cleared of all blame  unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend  how
grievous then was the thought that  of a situation so desirable in every
respect  so replete with advantage  so promising for happiness  jane had
been deprived  by the folly and indecorum of her own family 

when to these recollections was added the development of wickham  
character  it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before  were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful 

their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first  the very last evening was spent
there  and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey  gave them directions as to the best method of packing 
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way  that maria thought herself obliged  on her return  to undo all the
work of the morning  and pack her trunk afresh 

when they parted  lady catherine  with great condescension  wished them
a good journey  and invited them to come to hunsford again next year 
and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both 



chapter 38


on saturday morning elizabeth and mr  collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared  and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary 

 i know not  miss elizabeth   said he   whether mrs  collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us  but i am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it  the favour of your company has been much felt  i assure you  we
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode  our plain
manner of living  our small rooms and few domestics  and the little we
see of the world  must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself  but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension 
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly  

elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness  she
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment  and the pleasure of being with
charlotte  and the kind attentions she had received  must make  her 
feel the obliged  mr  collins was gratified  and with a more smiling
solemnity replied 

 it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably  we have certainly done our best  and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society  and 
from our connection with rosings  the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene  i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome  our situation with regard to
lady catherine   family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast  you see on what a footing we are  you
see how continually we are engaged there  in truth i must acknowledge
that  with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage  i should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion  while they are
sharers of our intimacy at rosings  

words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings  and he was
obliged to walk about the room  while elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences 

 you may  in fact  carry a very favourable report of us into
hertfordshire  my dear cousin  i flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so  lady catherine   great attentions to mrs  collins you
have been a daily witness of  and altogether i trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate  but on this point it will be
as well to be silent  only let me assure you  my dear miss elizabeth 
that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage  my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of
thinking  there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us  we seem to have been designed for each
other  

elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case  and with equal sincerity could add  that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts  she was not sorry  however  to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang 
poor charlotte  it was melancholy to leave her to such society  but she
had chosen it with her eyes open  and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go  she did not seem to ask for compassion  her
home and her housekeeping  her parish and her poultry  and all their
dependent concerns  had not yet lost their charms 

at length the chaise arrived  the trunks were fastened on  the parcels
placed within  and it was pronounced to be ready  after an affectionate
parting between the friends  elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
mr  collins  and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family  not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter  and his
compliments to mr  and mrs  gardiner  though unknown  he then handed her
in  maria followed  and the door was on the point of being closed 
when he suddenly reminded them  with some consternation  that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings 

 but   he added   you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them  with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here  

elizabeth made no objection  the door was then allowed to be shut  and
the carriage drove off 

 good gracious   cried maria  after a few minutes  silence   it seems
but a day or two since we first came  and yet how many things have
happened  

 a great many indeed   said her companion with a sigh 

 we have dined nine times at rosings  besides drinking tea there twice 
how much i shall have to tell  

elizabeth added privately   and how much i shall have to conceal  

their journey was performed without much conversation  or any alarm  and
within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr  gardiner  
house  where they were to remain a few days 

jane looked well  and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits  amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them  but jane was to go home with her  and at
longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation 

it was not without an effort  meanwhile  that she could wait even for
longbourn  before she told her sister of mr  darcy   proposals  to know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
jane  and must  at the same time  so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away  was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate 
and her fear  if she once entered on the subject  of being hurried
into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister
further 



chapter 39


it was the second week in may  in which the three young ladies set out
together from gracechurch street for the town of       in hertfordshire 
and  as they drew near the appointed inn where mr  bennet   carriage
was to meet them  they quickly perceived  in token of the coachman  
punctuality  both kitty and lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs 
these two girls had been above an hour in the place  happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner  watching the sentinel on guard  and
dressing a salad and cucumber 

after welcoming their sisters  they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords  exclaiming 
 is not this nice  is not this an agreeable surprise  

 and we mean to treat you all   added lydia   but you must lend us the
money  for we have just spent ours at the shop out there   then  showing
her purchases   look here  i have bought this bonnet  i do not think
it is very pretty  but i thought i might as well buy it as not  i shall
pull it to pieces as soon as i get home  and see if i can make it up any
better  

and when her sisters abused it as ugly  she added  with perfect
unconcern   oh  but there were two or three much uglier in the shop  and
when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh  i
think it will be very tolerable  besides  it will not much signify what
one wears this summer  after the     shire have left meryton  and they
are going in a fortnight  

 are they indeed   cried elizabeth  with the greatest satisfaction 

 they are going to be encamped near brighton  and i do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer  it would be such a delicious scheme 
and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all  mamma would like to
go too of all things  only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have  

 yes   thought elizabeth    that  would be a delightful scheme indeed 
and completely do for us at once  good heaven  brighton  and a whole
campful of soldiers  to us  who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia  and the monthly balls of meryton  

 now i have got some news for you   said lydia  as they sat down at
table   what do you think  it is excellent news  capital news  and about
a certain person we all like  

jane and elizabeth looked at each other  and the waiter was told he need
not stay  lydia laughed  and said 

 aye  that is just like your formality and discretion  you thought the
waiter must not hear  as if he cared  i dare say he often hears worse
things said than i am going to say  but he is an ugly fellow  i am glad
he is gone  i never saw such a long chin in my life  well  but now for
my news  it is about dear wickham  too good for the waiter  is it not 
there is no danger of wickham   marrying mary king  there   for you  she
is gone down to her uncle at liverpool  gone to stay  wickham is safe  

 and mary king is safe   added elizabeth   safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune  

 she is a great fool for going away  if she liked him  

 but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side   said jane 

 i am sure there is not on  his   i will answer for it  he never cared
three straws about her  who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing  

elizabeth was shocked to think that  however incapable of such
coarseness of  expression  herself  the coarseness of the  sentiment 
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal 

as soon as all had ate  and the elder ones paid  the carriage was
ordered  and after some contrivance  the whole party  with all their
boxes  work bags  and parcels  and the unwelcome addition of kitty   and
lydia   purchases  were seated in it 

 how nicely we are all crammed in   cried lydia   i am glad i bought my
bonnet  if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox  well  now
let us be quite comfortable and snug  and talk and laugh all the way
home  and in the first place  let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away  have you seen any pleasant men  have you had any
flirting  i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back  jane will be quite an old maid soon  i declare 
she is almost three and twenty  lord  how ashamed i should be of not
being married before three and twenty  my aunt phillips wants you so to
get husbands  you can   think  she says lizzy had better have taken mr 
collins  but  i  do not think there would have been any fun in it  lord 
how i should like to be married before any of you  and then i would
chaperon you about to all the balls  dear me  we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at colonel forster    kitty and me were to spend
the day there  and mrs  forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening   by the bye  mrs  forster and me are  such  friends   and so
she asked the two harringtons to come  but harriet was ill  and so pen
was forced to come by herself  and then  what do you think we did  we
dressed up chamberlayne in woman   clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady  only think what fun  not a soul knew of it  but colonel and mrs 
forster  and kitty and me  except my aunt  for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns  and you cannot imagine how well he looked  when denny 
and wickham  and pratt  and two or three more of the men came in  they
did not know him in the least  lord  how i laughed  and so did mrs 
forster  i thought i should have died  and  that  made the men suspect
something  and then they soon found out what was the matter  

with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes  did
lydia  assisted by kitty   hints and additions  endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to longbourn  elizabeth listened as little as she
could  but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickham   name 

their reception at home was most kind  mrs  bennet rejoiced to see jane
in undiminished beauty  and more than once during dinner did mr  bennet
say voluntarily to elizabeth 

 i am glad you are come back  lizzy  

their party in the dining room was large  for almost all the lucases
came to meet maria and hear the news  and various were the subjects that
occupied them  lady lucas was inquiring of maria  after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter  mrs  bennet was doubly engaged  on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane  who sat
some way below her  and  on the other  retailing them all to the younger
lucases  and lydia  in a voice rather louder than any other person   
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her 

 oh  mary   said she   i wish you had gone with us  for we had such fun 
as we went along  kitty and i drew up the blinds  and pretended there
was nobody in the coach  and i should have gone so all the way  if kitty
had not been sick  and when we got to the george  i do think we behaved
very handsomely  for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world  and if you would have gone  we would have treated
you too  and then when we came away it was such fun  i thought we never
should have got into the coach  i was ready to die of laughter  and then
we were so merry all the way home  we talked and laughed so loud  that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off  

to this mary very gravely replied   far be it from me  my dear sister 
to depreciate such pleasures  they would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds  but i confess they would have no charms for
 me   i should infinitely prefer a book  

but of this answer lydia heard not a word  she seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute  and never attended to mary at all 

in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to meryton  and to see how everybody went on  but elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme  it should not be said that the miss bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers 
there was another reason too for her opposition  she dreaded seeing mr 
wickham again  and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible  the
comfort to  her  of the regiment   approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression  in a fortnight they were to go  and once gone  she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account 

she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton
scheme  of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn  was under
frequent discussion between her parents  elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding  but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal  that her mother  though often
disheartened  had never yet despaired of succeeding at last 



chapter 40


elizabeth   impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome  and at length  resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned  and preparing her to be
surprised  she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between mr  darcy and herself 

miss bennet   astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly
natural  and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings  she was
sorry that mr  darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them  but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister   refusal must have given him 

 his being so sure of succeeding was wrong   said she   and certainly
ought not to have appeared  but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment  

 indeed   replied elizabeth   i am heartily sorry for him  but he has
other feelings  which will probably soon drive away his regard for me 
you do not blame me  however  for refusing him  

 blame you  oh  no  

 but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of wickham  

 no  i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did  

 but you  will  know it  when i tell you what happened the very next
day  

she then spoke of the letter  repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned george wickham  what a stroke was this for poor jane 
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind  as was here
collected in one individual  nor was darcy   vindication  though
grateful to her feelings  capable of consoling her for such discovery 
most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error  and
seek to clear the one without involving the other 

 this will not do   said elizabeth   you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything  take your choice  but you must be satisfied
with only one  there is but such a quantity of merit between them  just
enough to make one good sort of man  and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much  for my part  i am inclined to believe it all darcy   
but you shall do as you choose  

it was some time  however  before a smile could be extorted from jane 

 i do not know when i have been more shocked   said she   wickham so
very bad  it is almost past belief  and poor mr  darcy  dear lizzy  only
consider what he must have suffered  such a disappointment  and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion  too  and having to relate such a thing
of his sister  it is really too distressing  i am sure you must feel it
so  

 oh  no  my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both  i know you will do him such ample justice  that i am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent  your profusion
makes me saving  and if you lament over him much longer  my heart will
be as light as a feather  

 poor wickham  there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance  such an openness and gentleness in his manner  

 there certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men  one has got all the goodness  and the other all the
appearance of it  

 i never thought mr  darcy so deficient in the  appearance  of it as you
used to do  

 and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him  without any reason  it is such a spur to one   genius  such an
opening for wit  to have a dislike of that kind  one may be continually
abusive without saying anything just  but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty  

 lizzy  when you first read that letter  i am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now  

 indeed  i could not  i was uncomfortable enough  i may say unhappy  and
with no one to speak to about what i felt  no jane to comfort me and say
that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i
had  oh  how i wanted you  

 how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of wickham to mr  darcy  for now they  do  appear wholly
undeserved  

 certainly  but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging  there
is one point on which i want your advice  i want to be told whether i
ought  or ought not  to make our acquaintances in general understand
wickham   character  

miss bennet paused a little  and then replied   surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully  what is your opinion  

 that it ought not to be attempted  mr  darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public  on the contrary  every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself  and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct  who will believe me  the general prejudice against mr  darcy
is so violent  that it would be the death of half the good people in
meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light  i am not equal
to it  wickham will soon be gone  and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is  some time hence it will be all found out 
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before  at
present i will say nothing about it  

 you are quite right  to have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever  he is now  perhaps  sorry for what he has done  and anxious to
re establish a character  we must not make him desperate  

the tumult of elizabeth   mind was allayed by this conversation  she had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight 
and was certain of a willing listener in jane  whenever she might wish
to talk again of either  but there was still something lurking behind 
of which prudence forbade the disclosure  she dared not relate the other
half of mr  darcy   letter  nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend  here was knowledge in which no one
could partake  and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery   and then   said she   if that very
improbable event should ever take place  i shall merely be able to
tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself  the
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value  

she was now  on being settled at home  at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister   spirits  jane was not happy  she still cherished a
very tender affection for bingley  having never even fancied herself
in love before  her regard had all the warmth of first attachment 
and  from her age and disposition  greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast  and so fervently did she value his remembrance 
and prefer him to every other man  that all her good sense  and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends  were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity 

 well  lizzy   said mrs  bennet one day   what is your opinion  now  of
this sad business of jane    for my part  i am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody  i told my sister phillips so the other day  but
i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london  well  he is
a very undeserving young man  and i do not suppose there   the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now  there is no talk of
his coming to netherfield again in the summer  and i have inquired of
everybody  too  who is likely to know  

 i do not believe he will ever live at netherfield any more  

 oh well  it is just as he chooses  nobody wants him to come  though i
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill  and if i was her  i
would not have put up with it  well  my comfort is  i am sure jane will
die of a broken heart  and then he will be sorry for what he has done  

but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation 
she made no answer 

 well  lizzy   continued her mother  soon afterwards   and so the
collinses live very comfortable  do they  well  well  i only hope
it will last  and what sort of table do they keep  charlotte is an
excellent manager  i dare say  if she is half as sharp as her
mother  she is saving enough  there is nothing extravagant in  their 
housekeeping  i dare say  

 no  nothing at all  

 a great deal of good management  depend upon it  yes  yes   they  will
take care not to outrun their income   they  will never be distressed
for money  well  much good may it do them  and so  i suppose  they often
talk of having longbourn when your father is dead  they look upon it as
quite their own  i dare say  whenever that happens  

 it was a subject which they could not mention before me  

 no  it would have been strange if they had  but i make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves  well  if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own  so much the better  i should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me  



chapter 41


the first week of their return was soon gone  the second began  it was
the last of the regiment   stay in meryton  and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace  the dejection was almost
universal  the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat  drink 
and sleep  and pursue the usual course of their employments  very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and
lydia  whose own misery was extreme  and who could not comprehend such
hard heartedness in any of the family 

 good heaven  what is to become of us  what are we to do   would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe   how can you be smiling so 
lizzy  

their affectionate mother shared all their grief  she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion  five and twenty years
ago 

 i am sure   said she   i cried for two days together when colonel
miller   regiment went away  i thought i should have broken my heart  

 i am sure i shall break  mine    said lydia 

 if one could but go to brighton   observed mrs  bennet 

 oh  yes   if one could but go to brighton  but papa is so
disagreeable  

 a little sea bathing would set me up forever  

 and my aunt phillips is sure it would do  me  a great deal of good  
added kitty 

such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
longbourn house  elizabeth tried to be diverted by them  but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame  she felt anew the justice of mr  darcy  
objections  and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend 

but the gloom of lydia   prospect was shortly cleared away  for she
received an invitation from mrs  forster  the wife of the colonel of
the regiment  to accompany her to brighton  this invaluable friend was a
very young woman  and very lately married  a resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other  and out of
their  three  months  acquaintance they had been intimate  two  

the rapture of lydia on this occasion  her adoration of mrs  forster 
the delight of mrs  bennet  and the mortification of kitty  are scarcely
to be described  wholly inattentive to her sister   feelings  lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy  calling for everyone  
congratulations  and laughing and talking with more violence than ever 
whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish 

 i cannot see why mrs  forster should not ask  me  as well as lydia  
said she   though i am  not  her particular friend  i have just as much
right to be asked as she has  and more too  for i am two years older  

in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable  and jane to make
her resigned  as for elizabeth herself  this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia  that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter  and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known  she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go  she represented to him all the improprieties of lydia   general
behaviour  the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as mrs  forster  and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at brighton  where the temptations must
be greater than at home  he heard her attentively  and then said 

 lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other  and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances  

 if you were aware   said elizabeth   of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of lydia   unguarded and
imprudent manner  nay  which has already arisen from it  i am sure you
would judge differently in the affair  

 already arisen   repeated mr  bennet   what  has she frightened away
some of your lovers  poor little lizzy  but do not be cast down  such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret  come  let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by lydia   folly  

 indeed you are mistaken  i have no such injuries to resent  it is not
of particular  but of general evils  which i am now complaining  our
importance  our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility  the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
lydia   character  excuse me  for i must speak plainly  if you  my dear
father  will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits  and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life  she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment  her character
will be fixed  and she will  at sixteen  be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous  a flirt  too  in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation  without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person  and  from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind  wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite  in this danger
kitty also is comprehended  she will follow wherever lydia leads  vain 
ignorant  idle  and absolutely uncontrolled  oh  my dear father  can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known  and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace  

mr  bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject  and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply 

 do not make yourself uneasy  my love  wherever you and jane are known
you must be respected and valued  and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of  or i may say  three  very silly
sisters  we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to
brighton  let her go  then  colonel forster is a sensible man  and will
keep her out of any real mischief  and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody  at brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here  the officers will find
women better worth their notice  let us hope  therefore  that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance  at any rate  she cannot grow
many degrees worse  without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life  

with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content  but her own opinion
continued the same  and she left him disappointed and sorry  it was not
in her nature  however  to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them  she was confident of having performed her duty  and to fret
over unavoidable evils  or augment them by anxiety  was no part of her
disposition 

had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father  their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility  in lydia   imagination  a visit to brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness  she saw  with the creative eye
of fancy  the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers 
she saw herself the object of attention  to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown  she saw all the glories of the camp  its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines  crowded with the young
and the gay  and dazzling with scarlet  and  to complete the view  she
saw herself seated beneath a tent  tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once 

had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these  what would have been her sensations  they could have
been understood only by her mother  who might have felt nearly the same 
lydia   going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband   never intending to go there himself 

but they were entirely ignorant of what had passed  and their raptures
continued  with little intermission  to the very day of lydia   leaving
home 

elizabeth was now to see mr  wickham for the last time  having been
frequently in company with him since her return  agitation was pretty
well over  the agitations of formal partiality entirely so  she had even
learnt to detect  in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her  an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary  in his present
behaviour to herself  moreover  she had a fresh source of displeasure 
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve  after
what had since passed  to provoke her  she lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry  and while she steadily repressed it  could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing  that however long  and for whatever
cause  his attentions had been withdrawn  her vanity would be gratified 
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal 

on the very last day of the regiment   remaining at meryton  he dined 
with other of the officers  at longbourn  and so little was elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour  that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford  she
mentioned colonel fitzwilliam   and mr  darcy   having both spent three
weeks at rosings  and asked him  if he was acquainted with the former 

he looked surprised  displeased  alarmed  but with a moment  
recollection and a returning smile  replied  that he had formerly seen
him often  and  after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man 
asked her how she had liked him  her answer was warmly in his favour 
with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added 

 how long did you say he was at rosings  

 nearly three weeks  

 and you saw him frequently  

 yes  almost every day  

 his manners are very different from his cousin    

 yes  very different  but i think mr  darcy improves upon acquaintance  

 indeed   cried mr  wickham with a look which did not escape her   and
pray  may i ask     but checking himself  he added  in a gayer tone   is
it in address that he improves  has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style   for i dare not hope   he continued in a lower
and more serious tone   that he is improved in essentials  

 oh  no   said elizabeth   in essentials  i believe  he is very much
what he ever was  

while she spoke  wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words  or to distrust their meaning  there was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention  while she added 

 when i said that he improved on acquaintance  i did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement  but that  from
knowing him better  his disposition was better understood  

wickham   alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look  for a few minutes he was silent  till  shaking off his
embarrassment  he turned to her again  and said in the gentlest of
accents 

 you  who so well know my feeling towards mr  darcy  will readily
comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the  appearance  of what is right  his pride  in that direction 
may be of service  if not to himself  to many others  for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by  i only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you  i imagine  have been
alluding  is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt  of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe  his fear of her has always
operated  i know  when they were together  and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh  which i
am certain he has very much at heart  

elizabeth could not repress a smile at this  but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head  she saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances  and she was in no humour to indulge
him  the rest of the evening passed with the  appearance   on his
side  of usual cheerfulness  but with no further attempt to distinguish
elizabeth  and they parted at last with mutual civility  and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again 

when the party broke up  lydia returned with mrs  forster to meryton 
from whence they were to set out early the next morning  the separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic  kitty was the
only one who shed tears  but she did weep from vexation and envy  mrs 
bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter 
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible  advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to  and in
the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell  the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard 



chapter 42


had elizabeth   opinion been all drawn from her own family  she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort  her father  captivated by youth and beauty  and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give  had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her  respect 
esteem  and confidence had vanished for ever  and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown  but mr  bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on  in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice  he was fond of
the country and of books  and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments  to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted  than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement  this is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife  but where other powers of entertainment are wanting  the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given 

elizabeth  however  had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father   behaviour as a husband  she had always seen it with pain  but
respecting his abilities  and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself  she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook  and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which  in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children  was so highly reprehensible  but she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage  nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill judged a direction of talents  talents  which  rightly used 
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters  even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife 

when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickham   departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment  their parties
abroad were less varied than before  and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle  and  though kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense  since the disturbers
of her brain were removed  her other sister  from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended  was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering place and a camp  upon the whole  therefore  she found  what
has been sometimes found before  that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not  in taking place  bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself  it was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity  to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed  and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation  console herself for the
present  and prepare for another disappointment  her tour to the lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts  it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and kitty made inevitable  and could she have included jane in the
scheme  every part of it would have been perfect 

 but it is fortunate   thought she   that i have something to wish for 
were the whole arrangement complete  my disappointment would be certain 
but here  by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister   absence  i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised  a scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful  and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation  

when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and kitty  but her letters were always long expected  and
always very short  those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library  where such and such officers
had attended them  and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild  that she had a new gown  or a new parasol  which
she would have described more fully  but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry  as mrs  forster called her  and they were going off to
the camp  and from her correspondence with her sister  there was still
less to be learnt  for her letters to kitty  though rather longer  were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public 

after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence  health  good
humour  and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn  everything wore
a happier aspect  the families who had been in town for the winter came
back again  and summer finery and summer engagements arose  mrs  bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity  and  by the middle of
june  kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without
tears  an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by
the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day  unless  by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the war office  another regiment should be quartered in
meryton 

the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching  and a fortnight only was wanting of it  when a letter
arrived from mrs  gardiner  which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent  mr  gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in july  and must be in london again
within a month  and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far  and see so much as they had proposed  or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on  they were obliged to give up
the lakes  and substitute a more contracted tour  and  according to the
present plan  were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire  in that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks  and to mrs  gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction  the
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life  and where
they were now to spend a few days  was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock  chatsworth 
dovedale  or the peak 

elizabeth was excessively disappointed  she had set her heart on seeing
the lakes  and still thought there might have been time enough  but it
was her business to be satisfied  and certainly her temper to be happy 
and all was soon right again 

with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected  it was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its
owner   but surely   said she   i may enter his county with impunity 
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me  

the period of expectation was now doubled  four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt   arrival  but they did pass away  and mr 
and mrs  gardiner  with their four children  did at length appear at
longbourn  the children  two girls of six and eight years old  and two
younger boys  were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin jane  who was the general favourite  and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way  teaching them  playing with them  and loving them 

the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn  and set off the
next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement 
one enjoyment was certain  that of suitableness of companions 
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences  cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure  and affection
and intelligence  which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad 

it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire 
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay  oxford  blenheim  warwick  kenilworth  birmingham  etc  are
sufficiently known  a small part of derbyshire is all the present
concern  to the little town of lambton  the scene of mrs  gardiner  
former residence  and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained  they bent their steps  after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country  and within five miles of lambton 
elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated  it was not
in their direct road  nor more than a mile or two out of it  in
talking over their route the evening before  mrs  gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again  mr  gardiner declared his
willingness  and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation 

 my love  should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much   said her aunt   a place  too  with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected  wickham passed all his youth there  you
know  

elizabeth was distressed  she felt that she had no business at
pemberley  and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it  she
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses  after going over so
many  she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains 

mrs  gardiner abused her stupidity   if it were merely a fine house
richly furnished   said she   i should not care about it myself  but
the grounds are delightful  they have some of the finest woods in the
country  

elizabeth said no more  but her mind could not acquiesce  the
possibility of meeting mr  darcy  while viewing the place  instantly
occurred  it would be dreadful  she blushed at the very idea  and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk  but against this there were objections  and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource  if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered 

accordingly  when she retired at night  she asked the chambermaid
whether pemberley were not a very fine place  what was the name of its
proprietor  and  with no little alarm  whether the family were down for
the summer  a most welcome negative followed the last question  and her
alarms now being removed  she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself  and when the subject was revived the
next morning  and she was again applied to  could readily answer  and
with a proper air of indifference  that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme  to pemberley  therefore  they were to go 



chapter 43


elizabeth  as they drove along  watched for the first appearance of
pemberley woods with some perturbation  and when at length they turned
in at the lodge  her spirits were in a high flutter 

the park was very large  and contained great variety of ground  they
entered it in one of its lowest points  and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent 

elizabeth   mind was too full for conversation  but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view  they gradually ascended for
half a mile  and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence  where the wood ceased  and the eye was instantly caught by
pemberley house  situated on the opposite side of a valley  into which
the road with some abruptness wound  it was a large  handsome stone
building  standing well on rising ground  and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills  and in front  a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater  but without any artificial appearance  its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned  elizabeth was delighted  she
had never seen a place for which nature had done more  or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste  they were
all of them warm in their admiration  and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of pemberley might be something 

they descended the hill  crossed the bridge  and drove to the door  and 
while examining the nearer aspect of the house  all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned  she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken  on applying to see the place  they were admitted into the
hall  and elizabeth  as they waited for the housekeeper  had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was 

the housekeeper came  a respectable looking elderly woman  much less
fine  and more civil  than she had any notion of finding her  they
followed her into the dining parlour  it was a large  well proportioned
room  handsomely fitted up  elizabeth  after slightly surveying it  went
to a window to enjoy its prospect  the hill  crowned with wood  which
they had descended  receiving increased abruptness from the distance 
was a beautiful object  every disposition of the ground was good  and
she looked on the whole scene  the river  the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley  as far as she could trace it 
with delight  as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions  but from every window there were beauties to be
seen  the rooms were lofty and handsome  and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor  but elizabeth saw  with admiration of
his taste  that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine  with less of
splendour  and more real elegance  than the furniture of rosings 

 and of this place   thought she   i might have been mistress  with
these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted  instead of
viewing them as a stranger  i might have rejoiced in them as my own  and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt  but no    recollecting
herself   that could never be  my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me  i should not have been allowed to invite them  

this was a lucky recollection  it saved her from something very like
regret 

she longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent  but had not the courage for it  at length however  the question
was asked by her uncle  and she turned away with alarm  while mrs 
reynolds replied that he was  adding   but we expect him to morrow  with
a large party of friends   how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day 

her aunt now called her to look at a picture  she approached and saw the
likeness of mr  wickham  suspended  amongst several other miniatures 
over the mantelpiece  her aunt asked her  smilingly  how she liked it 
the housekeeper came forward  and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman  the son of her late master   steward  who had been brought
up by him at his own expense   he is now gone into the army   she added 
 but i am afraid he has turned out very wild  

mrs  gardiner looked at her niece with a smile  but elizabeth could not
return it 

 and that   said mrs  reynolds  pointing to another of the miniatures 
 is my master  and very like him  it was drawn at the same time as the
other  about eight years ago  

 i have heard much of your master   fine person   said mrs  gardiner 
looking at the picture   it is a handsome face  but  lizzy  you can tell
us whether it is like or not  

mrs  reynolds respect for elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master 

 does that young lady know mr  darcy  

elizabeth coloured  and said   a little  

 and do not you think him a very handsome gentleman  ma am  

 yes  very handsome  

 i am sure i know none so handsome  but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer  larger picture of him than this  this room was my late
master   favourite room  and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then  he was very fond of them  

this accounted to elizabeth for mr  wickham   being among them 

mrs  reynolds then directed their attention to one of miss darcy  drawn
when she was only eight years old 

 and is miss darcy as handsome as her brother   said mrs  gardiner 

 oh  yes  the handsomest young lady that ever was seen  and so
accomplished   she plays and sings all day long  in the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her  a present from my master  she
comes here to morrow with him  

mr  gardiner  whose manners were very easy and pleasant  encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks  mrs  reynolds  either
by pride or attachment  had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister 

 is your master much at pemberley in the course of the year  

 not so much as i could wish  sir  but i dare say he may spend half his
time here  and miss darcy is always down for the summer months  

 except   thought elizabeth   when she goes to ramsgate  

 if your master would marry  you might see more of him  

 yes  sir  but i do not know when  that  will be  i do not know who is
good enough for him  

mr  and mrs  gardiner smiled  elizabeth could not help saying   it is
very much to his credit  i am sure  that you should think so  

 i say no more than the truth  and everybody will say that knows him  
replied the other  elizabeth thought this was going pretty far  and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added   i have
never known a cross word from him in my life  and i have known him ever
since he was four years old  

this was praise  of all others most extraordinary  most opposite to her
ideas  that he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion 
her keenest attention was awakened  she longed to hear more  and was
grateful to her uncle for saying 

 there are very few people of whom so much can be said  you are lucky in
having such a master  

 yes  sir  i know i am  if i were to go through the world  i could
not meet with a better  but i have always observed  that they who are
good natured when children  are good natured when they grow up  and
he was always the sweetest tempered  most generous hearted boy in the
world  

elizabeth almost stared at her   can this be mr  darcy   thought she 

 his father was an excellent man   said mrs  gardiner 

 yes  ma am  that he was indeed  and his son will be just like him  just
as affable to the poor  

elizabeth listened  wondered  doubted  and was impatient for more  mrs 
reynolds could interest her on no other point  she related the subjects
of the pictures  the dimensions of the rooms  and the price of the
furniture  in vain  mr  gardiner  highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master  soon led again to the subject  and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase 

 he is the best landlord  and the best master   said she   that ever
lived  not like the wild young men nowadays  who think of nothing but
themselves  there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name  some people call him proud  but i am sure i never saw
anything of it  to my fancy  it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men  

 in what an amiable light does this place him   thought elizabeth 

 this fine account of him   whispered her aunt as they walked   is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend  

 perhaps we might be deceived  

 that is not very likely  our authority was too good  

on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting room  lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below  and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to miss darcy  who had taken a liking to the room when
last at pemberley 

 he is certainly a good brother   said elizabeth  as she walked towards
one of the windows 

mrs  reynolds anticipated miss darcy   delight  when she should enter
the room   and this is always the way with him   she added   whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment  there
is nothing he would not do for her  

the picture gallery  and two or three of the principal bedrooms  were
all that remained to be shown  in the former were many good paintings 
but elizabeth knew nothing of the art  and from such as had been already
visible below  she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss
darcy    in crayons  whose subjects were usually more interesting  and
also more intelligible 

in the gallery there were many family portraits  but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger  elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her  at last it arrested
her  and she beheld a striking resemblance to mr  darcy  with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her  she stood several minutes before the picture  in earnest
contemplation  and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery 
mrs  reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father  
lifetime 

there was certainly at this moment  in elizabeth   mind  a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance  the commendation bestowed on him by mrs  reynolds
was of no trifling nature  what praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant  as a brother  a landlord  a master  she
considered how many people   happiness were in his guardianship   how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow   how much of
good or evil must be done by him  every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character  and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented  and fixed his
eyes upon herself  she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before  she remembered its warmth  and
softened its impropriety of expression 

when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen 
they returned downstairs  and  taking leave of the housekeeper  were
consigned over to the gardener  who met them at the hall door 

as they walked across the hall towards the river  elizabeth turned back
to look again  her uncle and aunt stopped also  and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building  the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road  which led behind it to the stables 

they were within twenty yards of each other  and so abrupt was his
appearance  that it was impossible to avoid his sight  their eyes
instantly met  and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush  he absolutely started  and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise  but shortly recovering himself  advanced towards the party 
and spoke to elizabeth  if not in terms of perfect composure  at least
of perfect civility 

she had instinctively turned away  but stopping on his approach 
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome  had his first appearance  or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining  been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw mr  darcy  the gardener   expression of surprise  on
beholding his master  must immediately have told it  they stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece  who  astonished and confused 
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face  and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family  amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted  every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment  and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind  the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life  nor did he seem much more at ease  when he spoke  his accent
had none of its usual sedateness  and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left longbourn  and of her having stayed in
derbyshire  so often  and in so hurried a way  as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts 

at length every idea seemed to fail him  and  after standing a few
moments without saying a word  he suddenly recollected himself  and took
leave 

the others then joined her  and expressed admiration of his figure  but
elizabeth heard not a word  and wholly engrossed by her own feelings 
followed them in silence  she was overpowered by shame and vexation  her
coming there was the most unfortunate  the most ill judged thing in the
world  how strange it must appear to him  in what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man  it might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again  oh  why did she come  or  why did he
thus come a day before he was expected  had they been only ten minutes
sooner  they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination 
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived  that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage  she blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting  and his behaviour  so strikingly
altered  what could it mean  that he should even speak to her was
amazing   but to speak with such civility  to inquire after her family 
never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified  never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting  what
a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park  when he put
his letter into her hand  she knew not what to think  or how to account
for it 

they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water  and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground  or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching  but it was some time
before elizabeth was sensible of any of it  and  though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt  and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out  she
distinguished no part of the scene  her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of pemberley house  whichever it might be  where mr  darcy then
was  she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind  in
what manner he thought of her  and whether  in defiance of everything 
she was still dear to him  perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease  yet there had been  that  in his voice which was
not like ease  whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell  but he certainly had not seen her with
composure 

at length  however  the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her  and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself 

they entered the woods  and bidding adieu to the river for a while 
ascended some of the higher grounds  when  in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander  were many charming views of the
valley  the opposite hills  with the long range of woods overspreading
many  and occasionally part of the stream  mr  gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park  but feared it might be beyond a walk 
with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round 
it settled the matter  and they pursued the accustomed circuit  which
brought them again  after some time  in a descent among hanging woods 
to the edge of the water  and one of its narrowest parts  they crossed
it by a simple bridge  in character with the general air of the scene 
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited  and the
valley  here contracted into a glen  allowed room only for the stream 
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it 
elizabeth longed to explore its windings  but when they had crossed the
bridge  and perceived their distance from the house  mrs  gardiner 
who was not a great walker  could go no farther  and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible  her niece was 
therefore  obliged to submit  and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river  in the nearest direction  but their
progress was slow  for mr  gardiner  though seldom able to indulge the
taste  was very fond of fishing  and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water  and talking to the
man about them  that he advanced but little  whilst wandering on in this
slow manner  they were again surprised  and elizabeth   astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first  by the sight of mr  darcy
approaching them  and at no great distance  the walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side  allowed them to see him before
they met  elizabeth  however astonished  was at least more prepared
for an interview than before  and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness  if he really intended to meet them  for a few moments  indeed 
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path  the idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view  the
turning past  he was immediately before them  with a glance  she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility  and  to imitate his
politeness  she began  as they met  to admire the beauty of the place 
but she had not got beyond the words  delightful   and  charming   when
some unlucky recollections obtruded  and she fancied that praise of
pemberley from her might be mischievously construed  her colour changed 
and she said no more 

mrs  gardiner was standing a little behind  and on her pausing  he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends 
this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared 
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself   what will be his surprise   thought
she   when he knows who they are  he takes them now for people of
fashion  

the introduction  however  was immediately made  and as she named their
relationship to herself  she stole a sly look at him  to see how he bore
it  and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions  that he was  surprised  by the
connection was evident  he sustained it  however  with fortitude  and
so far from going away  turned back with them  and entered into
conversation with mr  gardiner  elizabeth could not but be pleased 
could not but triumph  it was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush  she listened most
attentively to all that passed between them  and gloried in every
expression  every sentence of her uncle  which marked his intelligence 
his taste  or his good manners 

the conversation soon turned upon fishing  and she heard mr  darcy
invite him  with the greatest civility  to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood  offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle  and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport  mrs  gardiner  who was
walking arm in arm with elizabeth  gave her a look expressive of wonder 
elizabeth said nothing  but it gratified her exceedingly  the compliment
must be all for herself  her astonishment  however  was extreme  and
continually was she repeating   why is he so altered  from what can
it proceed  it cannot be for  me   it cannot be for  my  sake that his
manners are thus softened  my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a
change as this  it is impossible that he should still love me  

after walking some time in this way  the two ladies in front  the two
gentlemen behind  on resuming their places  after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water plant  there chanced to be a little alteration  it originated
in mrs  gardiner  who  fatigued by the exercise of the morning  found
elizabeth   arm inadequate to her support  and consequently preferred
her husband    mr  darcy took her place by her niece  and they walked on
together  after a short silence  the lady first spoke  she wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place  and accordingly began by observing  that his arrival had been
very unexpected   for your housekeeper   she added   informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to morrow  and indeed  before we
left bakewell  we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country   he acknowledged the truth of it all  and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling   they
will join me early to morrow   he continued   and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you  mr  bingley and his sisters  

elizabeth answered only by a slight bow  her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when mr  bingley   name had been the last
mentioned between them  and  if she might judge by his complexion   his 
mind was not very differently engaged 

 there is also one other person in the party   he continued after a
pause   who more particularly wishes to be known to you  will you allow
me  or do i ask too much  to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at lambton  

the surprise of such an application was great indeed  it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it  she immediately felt
that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother  and  without looking farther  it was
satisfactory  it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her 

they now walked on in silence  each of them deep in thought  elizabeth
was not comfortable  that was impossible  but she was flattered and
pleased  his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind  they soon outstripped the others  and when they had
reached the carriage  mr  and mrs  gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind 

he then asked her to walk into the house  but she declared herself not
tired  and they stood together on the lawn  at such a time much might
have been said  and silence was very awkward  she wanted to talk  but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject  at last she recollected
that she had been travelling  and they talked of matlock and dove dale
with great perseverance  yet time and her aunt moved slowly  and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete a tete was
over  on mr  and mrs  gardiner   coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment  but this was declined  and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness  mr  darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage  and when it drove off  elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house 

the observations of her uncle and aunt now began  and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected 
 he is perfectly well behaved  polite  and unassuming   said her uncle 

 there  is  something a little stately in him  to be sure   replied her
aunt   but it is confined to his air  and is not unbecoming  i can now
say with the housekeeper  that though some people may call him proud  i
have seen nothing of it  

 i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us  it was more
than civil  it was really attentive  and there was no necessity for such
attention  his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling  

 to be sure  lizzy   said her aunt   he is not so handsome as wickham 
or  rather  he has not wickham   countenance  for his features
are perfectly good  but how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable  

elizabeth excused herself as well as she could  said that she had liked
him better when they had met in kent than before  and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning 

 but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities   replied
her uncle   your great men often are  and therefore i shall not take him
at his word  as he might change his mind another day  and warn me off
his grounds  

elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character  but
said nothing 

 from what we have seen of him   continued mrs  gardiner   i really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor wickham  he has not an ill natured look 
on the contrary  there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks  and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart  but  to be sure  the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character 
i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes  but he is a liberal
master  i suppose  and  that  in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue  

elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to wickham  and therefore gave them to understand  in
as guarded a manner as she could  that by what she had heard from
his relations in kent  his actions were capable of a very different
construction  and that his character was by no means so faulty  nor
wickham   so amiable  as they had been considered in hertfordshire  in
confirmation of this  she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected  without actually naming
her authority  but stating it to be such as might be relied on 

mrs  gardiner was surprised and concerned  but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures  every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection  and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else  fatigued as she had been by the morning   walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance  and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years  discontinuance 

the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends  and she could do nothing
but think  and think with wonder  of mr  darcy   civility  and  above
all  of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister 



chapter 44


elizabeth had settled it that mr  darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching pemberley  and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning 
but her conclusion was false  for on the very morning after their
arrival at lambton  these visitors came  they had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends  and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family  when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window  and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street  elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery  guessed what it meant  and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected  her uncle and aunt were all amazement  and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke  joined to the circumstance itself  and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day  opened to them a new idea on
the business  nothing had ever suggested it before  but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece  while these
newly born notions were passing in their heads  the perturbation of
elizabeth   feelings was at every moment increasing  she was quite
amazed at her own discomposure  but amongst other causes of disquiet 
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour  and  more than commonly anxious to please  she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her 

she retreated from the window  fearful of being seen  and as she walked
up and down the room  endeavouring to compose herself  saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse 

miss darcy and her brother appeared  and this formidable introduction
took place  with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself  since her
being at lambton  she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud 
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy  she found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable 

miss darcy was tall  and on a larger scale than elizabeth  and  though
little more than sixteen  her figure was formed  and her appearance
womanly and graceful  she was less handsome than her brother  but there
was sense and good humour in her face  and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle  elizabeth  who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr  darcy had been  was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings 

they had not long been together before mr  darcy told her that bingley
was also coming to wait on her  and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction  and prepare for such a visitor  when bingley   quick
step was heard on the stairs  and in a moment he entered the room  all
elizabeth   anger against him had been long done away  but had she still
felt any  it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again  he
inquired in a friendly  though general way  after her family  and looked
and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done 

to mr  and mrs  gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself  they had long wished to see him  the whole party before
them  indeed  excited a lively attention  the suspicions which had just
arisen of mr  darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry  and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love  of the lady   sensations they remained a little
in doubt  but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough 

elizabeth  on her side  had much to do  she wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors  she wanted to compose her own  and
to make herself agreeable to all  and in the latter object  where she
feared most to fail  she was most sure of success  for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour  bingley
was ready  georgiana was eager  and darcy determined  to be pleased 

in seeing bingley  her thoughts naturally flew to her sister  and  oh 
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner  sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions  and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that  as he looked at her  he was trying to trace a resemblance  but 
though this might be imaginary  she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to miss darcy  who had been set up as a rival to jane  no look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard  nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister  on this point
she was soon satisfied  and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted  which  in her anxious interpretation  denoted a
recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness  and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her  had he dared  he observed
to her  at a moment when the others were talking together  and in a tone
which had something of real regret  that it  was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her   and  before she could reply 
he added   it is above eight months  we have not met since the 26th of
november  when we were all dancing together at netherfield  

elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact  and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her  when unattended to by any of the rest  whether
 all  her sisters were at longbourn  there was not much in the question 
nor in the preceding remark  but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning 

it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr  darcy himself 
but  whenever she did catch a glimpse  she saw an expression of general
complaisance  and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from  hauteur  or disdain of his companions  as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove  had at least outlived one day  when
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace  when she saw him thus civil  not only to herself  but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained  and recollected their last
lively scene in hunsford parsonage  the difference  the change was
so great  and struck so forcibly on her mind  that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible  never  even in the company
of his dear friends at netherfield  or his dignified relations
at rosings  had she seen him so desirous to please  so free from
self consequence or unbending reserve  as now  when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours  and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and
rosings 

their visitors stayed with them above half an hour  and when they arose
to depart  mr  darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing mr  and mrs  gardiner  and miss bennet  to dinner
at pemberley  before they left the country  miss darcy  though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations 
readily obeyed  mrs  gardiner looked at her niece  desirous of knowing
how  she   whom the invitation most concerned  felt disposed as to its
acceptance  but elizabeth had turned away her head  presuming however 
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal  and seeing in her husband  who was fond of
society  a perfect willingness to accept it  she ventured to engage for
her attendance  and the day after the next was fixed on 

bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth
again  having still a great deal to say to her  and many inquiries to
make after all their hertfordshire friends  elizabeth  construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister  was pleased  and on
this account  as well as some others  found herself  when their
visitors left them  capable of considering the last half hour with some
satisfaction  though while it was passing  the enjoyment of it had been
little  eager to be alone  and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt  she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of bingley  and then hurried away to dress 

but she had no reason to fear mr  and mrs  gardiner   curiosity  it was
not their wish to force her communication  it was evident that she was
much better acquainted with mr  darcy than they had before any idea of 
it was evident that he was very much in love with her  they saw much to
interest  but nothing to justify inquiry 

of mr  darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well  and  as far
as their acquaintance reached  there was no fault to find  they could
not be untouched by his politeness  and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant   report  without any reference
to any other account  the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for mr  darcy  there was now an interest 
however  in believing the housekeeper  and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old  and whose own manners indicated respectability  was not to be
hastily rejected  neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight  they had
nothing to accuse him of but pride  pride he probably had  and if not 
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town
where the family did not visit  it was acknowledged  however  that he
was a liberal man  and did much good among the poor 

with respect to wickham  the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation  for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood  it was yet a well known
fact that  on his quitting derbyshire  he had left many debts behind
him  which mr  darcy afterwards discharged 

as for elizabeth  her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than
the last  and the evening  though as it passed it seemed long  was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards  one  in that mansion 
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out  she
certainly did not hate him  no  hatred had vanished long ago  and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him 
that could be so called  the respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities  though at first unwillingly admitted  had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling  and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature  by the testimony so highly in
his favour  and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light 
which yesterday had produced  but above all  above respect and esteem 
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked 
it was gratitude  gratitude  not merely for having once loved her 
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him  and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection  he who  she had been persuaded  would avoid
her as his greatest enemy  seemed  on this accidental meeting  most
eager to preserve the acquaintance  and without any indelicate display
of regard  or any peculiarity of manner  where their two selves only
were concerned  was soliciting the good opinion of her friends  and bent
on making her known to his sister  such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude  for to love  ardent
love  it must be attributed  and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged  as by no means unpleasing  though it could not be
exactly defined  she respected  she esteemed  she was grateful to him 
she felt a real interest in his welfare  and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself  and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power  which her
fancy told her she still possessed  of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses 

it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece  that
such a striking civility as miss darcy   in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at pemberley  for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast  ought to be imitated  though it could not be equalled 
by some exertion of politeness on their side  and  consequently  that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following
morning  they were  therefore  to go  elizabeth was pleased  though when
she asked herself the reason  she had very little to say in reply 

mr  gardiner left them soon after breakfast  the fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before  and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at pemberley before noon 



chapter 45


convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingley   dislike of her had
originated in jealousy  she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at pemberley must be to her  and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady   side the acquaintance would now be renewed 

on reaching the house  they were shown through the hall into the saloon 
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer  its windows
opening to the ground  admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house  and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn 

in this house they were received by miss darcy  who was sitting there
with mrs  hurst and miss bingley  and the lady with whom she lived in
london  georgiana   reception of them was very civil  but attended with
all the embarrassment which  though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong  would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved  mrs  gardiner and her niece 
however  did her justice  and pitied her 

by mrs  hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey  and 
on their being seated  a pause  awkward as such pauses must always be 
succeeded for a few moments  it was first broken by mrs  annesley  a
genteel  agreeable looking woman  whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the
others  and between her and mrs  gardiner  with occasional help from
elizabeth  the conversation was carried on  miss darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it  and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard 

elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley 
and that she could not speak a word  especially to miss darcy  without
calling her attention  this observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter  had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance  but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much  her own thoughts were employing her  she expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room  she wished  she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them  and whether
she wished or feared it most  she could scarcely determine  after
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss
bingley   voice  elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family  she answered with equal
indifference and brevity  and the other said no more 

the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat  cake  and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season  but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from mrs  annesley to miss darcy had been
given  to remind her of her post  there was now employment for the whole
party  for though they could not all talk  they could all eat  and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes  nectarines  and peaches soon collected
them round the table 

while thus engaged  elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr  darcy  by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room  and then  though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate  she began to
regret that he came 

he had been some time with mr  gardiner  who  with two or three other
gentlemen from the house  was engaged by the river  and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
georgiana that morning  no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed  a resolution the more
necessary to be made  but perhaps not the more easily kept  because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them 
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room  in no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingley    in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects  for jealousy had not yet made her desperate  and her attentions
to mr  darcy were by no means over  miss darcy  on her brother  
entrance  exerted herself much more to talk  and elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted  and forwarded
as much as possible  every attempt at conversation on either side  miss
bingley saw all this likewise  and  in the imprudence of anger  took the
first opportunity of saying  with sneering civility 

 pray  miss eliza  are not the     shire militia removed from meryton 
they must be a great loss to  your  family  

in darcy   presence she dared not mention wickham   name  but elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts  and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment   distress 
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack  she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone  while
she spoke  an involuntary glance showed her darcy  with a heightened
complexion  earnestly looking at her  and his sister overcome with
confusion  and unable to lift up her eyes  had miss bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend  she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint  but she had merely intended to discompose
elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial  to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
darcy   opinion  and  perhaps  to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps  not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcy  
meditated elopement  to no creature had it been revealed  where secrecy
was possible  except to elizabeth  and from all bingley   connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it  from the very
wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him  of their becoming
hereafter her own  he had certainly formed such a plan  and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss
bennet  it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend 

elizabeth   collected behaviour  however  soon quieted his emotion  and
as miss bingley  vexed and disappointed  dared not approach nearer to
wickham  georgiana also recovered in time  though not enough to be able
to speak any more  her brother  whose eye she feared to meet  scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair  and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully 

their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned  and while mr  darcy was attending them to their carriage miss
bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeth   person 
behaviour  and dress  but georgiana would not join her  her brother  
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour  his judgement could not
err  and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable  when
darcy returned to the saloon  miss bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister 

 how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning  mr  darcy   she
cried   i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter  she is grown so brown and coarse  louisa and i were agreeing
that we should not have known her again  

however little mr  darcy might have liked such an address  he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned  no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer 

 for my own part   she rejoined   i must confess that i never could
see any beauty in her  her face is too thin  her complexion has no
brilliancy  and her features are not at all handsome  her nose
wants character  there is nothing marked in its lines  her teeth are
tolerable  but not out of the common way  and as for her eyes 
which have sometimes been called so fine  i could never see anything
extraordinary in them  they have a sharp  shrewish look  which i do
not like at all  and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency
without fashion  which is intolerable  

persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth  this was not
the best method of recommending herself  but angry people are not always
wise  and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled  she had all the
success she expected  he was resolutely silent  however  and  from a
determination of making him speak  she continued 

 i remember  when we first knew her in hertfordshire  how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty  and i particularly recollect
your saying one night  after they had been dining at netherfield    she 
a beauty   i should as soon call her mother a wit   but afterwards she
seemed to improve on you  and i believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time  

 yes   replied darcy  who could contain himself no longer   but  that 
was only when i first saw her  for it is many months since i have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance  

he then went away  and miss bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself 

mrs  gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit  as they returned  except what had particularly interested them
both  the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed 
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention  they talked
of his sister  his friends  his house  his fruit  of everything but
himself  yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs  gardiner thought of
him  and mrs  gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece  
beginning the subject 



chapter 46


elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
jane on their first arrival at lambton  and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there  but
on the third her repining was over  and her sister justified  by the
receipt of two letters from her at once  on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere  elizabeth was not surprised at it  as
jane had written the direction remarkably ill 

they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in  and
her uncle and aunt  leaving her to enjoy them in quiet  set off by
themselves  the one missent must first be attended to  it had been
written five days ago  the beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements  with such news as the country afforded 
but the latter half  which was dated a day later  and written in evident
agitation  gave more important intelligence  it was to this effect 

 since writing the above  dearest lizzy  something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature  but i am afraid of alarming you  be
assured that we are all well  what i have to say relates to poor lydia 
an express came at twelve last night  just as we were all gone to bed 
from colonel forster  to inform us that she was gone off to scotland
with one of his officers  to own the truth  with wickham  imagine our
surprise  to kitty  however  it does not seem so wholly unexpected  i am
very  very sorry  so imprudent a match on both sides  but i am willing
to hope the best  and that his character has been misunderstood 
thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him  but this step
 and let us rejoice over it  marks nothing bad at heart  his choice is
disinterested at least  for he must know my father can give her nothing 
our poor mother is sadly grieved  my father bears it better  how
thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against
him  we must forget it ourselves  they were off saturday night about
twelve  as is conjectured  but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight  the express was sent off directly  my dear lizzy  they must have
passed within ten miles of us  colonel forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon  lydia left a few lines for his wife  informing her of
their intention  i must conclude  for i cannot be long from my poor
mother  i am afraid you will not be able to make it out  but i hardly
know what i have written  

without allowing herself time for consideration  and scarcely knowing
what she felt  elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other  and opening it with the utmost impatience  read as follows  it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first 

 by this time  my dearest sister  you have received my hurried letter  i
wish this may be more intelligible  but though not confined for time  my
head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent  dearest
lizzy  i hardly know what i would write  but i have bad news for you 
and it cannot be delayed  imprudent as the marriage between mr  wickham
and our poor lydia would be  we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place  for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to scotland  colonel forster came yesterday  having left brighton the
day before  not many hours after the express  though lydia   short
letter to mrs     gave them to understand that they were going to gretna
green  something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that   
never intended to go there  or to marry lydia at all  which was
repeated to colonel     who  instantly taking the alarm  set off from   
intending to trace their route  he did trace them easily to clapham 
but no further  for on entering that place  they removed into a hackney
coach  and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom  all that
is known after this is  that they were seen to continue the london road 
i know not what to think  after making every possible inquiry on that
side london  colonel    came on into hertfordshire  anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes  and at the inns in barnet and hatfield  but
without any success  no such people had been seen to pass through  with
the kindest concern he came on to longbourn  and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart  i am sincerely grieved
for him and mrs      but no one can throw any blame on them  our
distress  my dear lizzy  is very great  my father and mother believe the
worst  but i cannot think so ill of him  many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan  and even if  he  could form such a design against a
young woman of lydia   connections  which is not likely  can i suppose
her so lost to everything  impossible  i grieve to find  however  that
colonel    is not disposed to depend upon their marriage  he shook his
head when i expressed my hopes  and said he feared    was not a man to
be trusted  my poor mother is really ill  and keeps her room  could she
exert herself  it would be better  but this is not to be expected  and
as to my father  i never in my life saw him so affected  poor kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment  but as it was a matter of
confidence  one cannot wonder  i am truly glad  dearest lizzy  that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes  but now  as the
first shock is over  shall i own that i long for your return  i am not
so selfish  however  as to press for it  if inconvenient  adieu  i
take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not  but
circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible  i know my dear uncle and aunt so well 
that i am not afraid of requesting it  though i have still something
more to ask of the former  my father is going to london with colonel
forster instantly  to try to discover her  what he means to do i am sure
i know not  but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way  and colonel forster is obliged to
be at brighton again to morrow evening  in such an exigence  my
uncle   advice and assistance would be everything in the world  he will
immediately comprehend what i must feel  and i rely upon his goodness  

 oh  where  where is my uncle   cried elizabeth  darting from her seat
as she finished the letter  in eagerness to follow him  without losing
a moment of the time so precious  but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant  and mr  darcy appeared  her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start  and before he could recover himself to speak 
she  in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydia   situation 
hastily exclaimed   i beg your pardon  but i must leave you  i must find
mr  gardiner this moment  on business that cannot be delayed  i have not
an instant to lose  

 good god  what is the matter   cried he  with more feeling than
politeness  then recollecting himself   i will not detain you a minute 
but let me  or let the servant go after mr  and mrs  gardiner  you are
not well enough  you cannot go yourself  

elizabeth hesitated  but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them  calling back
the servant  therefore  she commissioned him  though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible  to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly 

on his quitting the room she sat down  unable to support herself  and
looking so miserably ill  that it was impossible for darcy to leave her 
or to refrain from saying  in a tone of gentleness and commiseration 
 let me call your maid  is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief  a glass of wine  shall i get you one  you are very ill  

 no  i thank you   she replied  endeavouring to recover herself   there
is nothing the matter with me  i am quite well  i am only distressed by
some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn  

she burst into tears as she alluded to it  and for a few minutes could
not speak another word  darcy  in wretched suspense  could only say
something indistinctly of his concern  and observe her in compassionate
silence  at length she spoke again   i have just had a letter from jane 
with such dreadful news  it cannot be concealed from anyone  my younger
sister has left all her friends  has eloped  has thrown herself into
the power of  of mr  wickham  they are gone off together from brighton 
 you  know him too well to doubt the rest  she has no money  no
connections  nothing that can tempt him to  she is lost for ever  

darcy was fixed in astonishment   when i consider   she added in a yet
more agitated voice   that i might have prevented it  i  who knew what
he was  had i but explained some part of it only  some part of what i
learnt  to my own family  had his character been known  this could not
have happened  but it is all  all too late now  

 i am grieved indeed   cried darcy   grieved  shocked  but is it
certain  absolutely certain  

 oh  yes  they left brighton together on sunday night  and were traced
almost to london  but not beyond  they are certainly not gone to
scotland  

 and what has been done  what has been attempted  to recover her  

 my father is gone to london  and jane has written to beg my uncle  
immediate assistance  and we shall be off  i hope  in half an hour  but
nothing can be done  i know very well that nothing can be done  how is
such a man to be worked on  how are they even to be discovered  i have
not the smallest hope  it is every way horrible  

darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence 

 when  my  eyes were opened to his real character  oh  had i known what
i ought  what i dared to do  but i knew not  i was afraid of doing too
much  wretched  wretched mistake  

darcy made no answer  he seemed scarcely to hear her  and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation  his brow contracted  his air
gloomy  elizabeth soon observed  and instantly understood it  her
power was sinking  everything  must  sink under such a proof of family
weakness  such an assurance of the deepest disgrace  she could neither
wonder nor condemn  but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom  afforded no palliation of her distress  it
was  on the contrary  exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes  and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him  as now  when all love must be vain 

but self  though it would intrude  could not engross her  lydia  the
humiliation  the misery she was bringing on them all  soon swallowed
up every private care  and covering her face with her handkerchief 
elizabeth was soon lost to everything else  and  after a pause of
several minutes  was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion  who  in a manner which  though it spoke
compassion  spoke likewise restraint  said   i am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence  nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my
stay  but real  though unavailing concern  would to heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress  but i will not torment you with vain wishes  which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks  this unfortunate affair will  i
fear  prevent my sister   having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley
to day  

 oh  yes  be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy  say that
urgent business calls us home immediately  conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible  i know it cannot be long  

he readily assured her of his secrecy  again expressed his sorrow for
her distress  wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope  and leaving his compliments for her relations  with only
one serious  parting look  went away 

as he quitted the room  elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in derbyshire  and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance  so full
of contradictions and varieties  sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance  and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination 

if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection  elizabeth  
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty  but if
otherwise  if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural  in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object  and even before two words have been
exchanged  nothing can be said in her defence  except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham 
and that its ill success might  perhaps  authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment  be that as it may  she saw him
go with regret  and in this early example of what lydia   infamy must
produce  found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business  never  since reading jane   second letter  had she entertained
a hope of wickham   meaning to marry her  no one but jane  she thought 
could flatter herself with such an expectation  surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development  while the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind  she was all surprise  all astonishment that
wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money  and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible  but now it was all too natural  for such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms  and though she did not suppose
lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage  she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey 

she had never perceived  while the regiment was in hertfordshire  that
lydia had any partiality for him  but she was convinced that lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody  sometimes one
officer  sometimes another  had been her favourite  as their attentions
raised them in her opinion  her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object  the mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl  oh  how acutely did she now
feel it 

she was wild to be at home  to hear  to see  to be upon the spot to
share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her  in a
family so deranged  a father absent  a mother incapable of exertion  and
requiring constant attendance  and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for lydia  her uncle   interference seemed of the utmost
importance  and till he entered the room her impatience was severe  mr 
and mrs  gardiner had hurried back in alarm  supposing by the servant  
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill  but satisfying them
instantly on that head  she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons  reading the two letters aloud  and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy  though lydia had never been a
favourite with them  mr  and mrs  gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted  not lydia only  but all were concerned in it  and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror  mr  gardiner promised every
assistance in his power  elizabeth  though expecting no less  thanked
him with tears of gratitude  and all three being actuated by one spirit 
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled  they were to
be off as soon as possible   but what is to be done about pemberley  
cried mrs  gardiner   john told us mr  darcy was here when you sent for
us  was it so  

 yes  and i told him we should not be able to keep our engagement 
 that  is all settled  

 what is all settled   repeated the other  as she ran into her room to
prepare   and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth  oh  that i knew how it was  

but wishes were vain  or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour  had elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle  she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself  but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt  and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at lambton  with false excuses for their
sudden departure  an hour  however  saw the whole completed  and mr 
gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn  nothing
remained to be done but to go  and elizabeth  after all the misery of
the morning  found herself  in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed  seated in the carriage  and on the road to longbourn 



chapter 47


 i have been thinking it over again  elizabeth   said her uncle  as they
drove from the town   and really  upon serious consideration  i am much
more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter  it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless  and who was actually staying in his colonel   family  that i
am strongly inclined to hope the best  could he expect that her friends
would not step forward  could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment  after such an affront to colonel forster  his temptation is
not adequate to the risk  

 do you really think so   cried elizabeth  brightening up for a moment 

 upon my word   said mrs  gardiner   i begin to be of your uncle  
opinion  it is really too great a violation of decency  honour  and
interest  for him to be guilty of  i cannot think so very ill of
wickham  can you yourself  lizzy  so wholly give him up  as to believe
him capable of it  

 not  perhaps  of neglecting his own interest  but of every other
neglect i can believe him capable  if  indeed  it should be so  but i
dare not hope it  why should they not go on to scotland if that had been
the case  

 in the first place   replied mr  gardiner   there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to scotland  

 oh  but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption  and  besides  no traces of them were to be found on the
barnet road  

 well  then  supposing them to be in london  they may be there  though
for the purpose of concealment  for no more exceptional purpose  it is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side  and it
might strike them that they could be more economically  though less
expeditiously  married in london than in scotland  

 but why all this secrecy  why any fear of detection  why must their
marriage be private  oh  no  no  this is not likely  his most particular
friend  you see by jane   account  was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her  wickham will never marry a woman without some money  he
cannot afford it  and what claims has lydia  what attraction has she
beyond youth  health  and good humour that could make him  for her sake 
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well  as to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her  i am not able to judge  for i know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce  but as to your
other objection  i am afraid it will hardly hold good  lydia has
no brothers to step forward  and he might imagine  from my father  
behaviour  from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family  that  he  would
do as little  and think as little about it  as any father could do  in
such a matter  

 but can you think that lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage  

 it does seem  and it is most shocking indeed   replied elizabeth  with
tears in her eyes   that a sister   sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt  but  really  i know not what to say 
perhaps i am not doing her justice  but she is very young  she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects  and for the last half year 
nay  for a twelvemonth  she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity  she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner  and to adopt any opinions that came in her way 
since the     shire were first quartered in meryton  nothing but love 
flirtation  and officers have been in her head  she has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject  to give
greater  what shall i call it  susceptibility to her feelings  which are
naturally lively enough  and we all know that wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman  

 but you see that jane   said her aunt   does not think so very ill of
wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt  

 of whom does jane ever think ill  and who is there  whatever might be
their former conduct  that she would think capable of such an attempt 
till it were proved against them  but jane knows  as well as i do  what
wickham really is  we both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word  that he has neither integrity nor honour  that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating  

 and do you really know all this   cried mrs  gardiner  whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive 

 i do indeed   replied elizabeth  colouring   i told you  the other day 
of his infamous behaviour to mr  darcy  and you yourself  when last at
longbourn  heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him  and there are other
circumstances which i am not at liberty  which it is not worth while to
relate  but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless  from
what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud 
reserved  disagreeable girl  yet he knew to the contrary himself  he
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her  

 but does lydia know nothing of this  can she be ignorant of what you
and jane seem so well to understand  

 oh  yes   that  that is the worst of all  till i was in kent  and saw
so much both of mr  darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam  i was
ignorant of the truth myself  and when i returned home  the     shire
was to leave meryton in a week or fortnight   time  as that was the
case  neither jane  to whom i related the whole  nor i  thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public  for of what use could
it apparently be to any one  that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown  and even when it was
settled that lydia should go with mrs  forster  the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me  that  she  could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head  that such a
consequence as  this  could ensue  you may easily believe  was far
enough from my thoughts  

 when they all removed to brighton  therefore  you had no reason  i
suppose  to believe them fond of each other  

 not the slightest  i can remember no symptom of affection on either
side  and had anything of the kind been perceptible  you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away  when first
he entered the corps  she was ready enough to admire him  but so we all
were  every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months  but he never distinguished  her  by any particular
attention  and  consequently  after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration  her fancy for him gave way  and others of the regiment 
who treated her with more distinction  again became her favourites  

                                   

it may be easily believed  that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears  hopes  and conjectures  on this interesting subject  by
its repeated discussion  no other could detain them from it long  during
the whole of the journey  from elizabeth   thoughts it was never absent 
fixed there by the keenest of all anguish  self reproach  she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness 

they travelled as expeditiously as possible  and  sleeping one night
on the road  reached longbourn by dinner time the next day  it was a
comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations 

the little gardiners  attracted by the sight of a chaise  were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock  and  when the
carriage drove up to the door  the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces  and displayed itself over their whole bodies  in a variety of
capers and frisks  was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome 

elizabeth jumped out  and  after giving each of them a hasty kiss 
hurried into the vestibule  where jane  who came running down from her
mother   apartment  immediately met her 

elizabeth  as she affectionately embraced her  whilst tears filled the
eyes of both  lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives 

 not yet   replied jane   but now that my dear uncle is come  i hope
everything will be well  

 is my father in town  

 yes  he went on tuesday  as i wrote you word  

 and have you heard from him often  

 we have heard only twice  he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety  and to give me his directions  which i
particularly begged him to do  he merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention  

 and my mother  how is she  how are you all  

 my mother is tolerably well  i trust  though her spirits are greatly
shaken  she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all  she does not yet leave her dressing room  mary and kitty  thank
heaven  are quite well  

 but you  how are you   cried elizabeth   you look pale  how much you
must have gone through  

her sister  however  assured her of her being perfectly well  and their
conversation  which had been passing while mr  and mrs  gardiner were
engaged with their children  was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party  jane ran to her uncle and aunt  and welcomed and
thanked them both  with alternate smiles and tears 

when they were all in the drawing room  the questions which elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others  and they soon
found that jane had no intelligence to give  the sanguine hope of
good  however  which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her  she still expected that it would all end well  and that
every morning would bring some letter  either from lydia or her father 
to explain their proceedings  and  perhaps  announce their marriage 

mrs  bennet  to whose apartment they all repaired  after a few minutes 
conversation together  received them exactly as might be expected  with
tears and lamentations of regret  invectives against the villainous
conduct of wickham  and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage 
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing 

 if i had been able   said she   to carry my point in going to brighton 
with all my family   this  would not have happened  but poor dear lydia
had nobody to take care of her  why did the forsters ever let her go out
of their sight  i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side  for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after  i always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her  but i was overruled  as i always am  poor dear child 
and now here   mr  bennet gone away  and i know he will fight wickham 
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed  and what is to become
of us all  the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave  and if you are not kind to us  brother  i do not know what we
shall do  

they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas  and mr  gardiner  after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family  told her
that he meant to be in london the very next day  and would assist mr 
bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia 

 do not give way to useless alarm   added he   though it is right to be
prepared for the worst  there is no occasion to look on it as certain 
it is not quite a week since they left brighton  in a few days more we
may gain some news of them  and till we know that they are not married 
and have no design of marrying  do not let us give the matter over as
lost  as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother  and make
him come home with me to gracechurch street  and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done  

 oh  my dear brother   replied mrs  bennet   that is exactly what i
could most wish for  and now do  when you get to town  find them out 
wherever they may be  and if they are not married already   make  them
marry  and as for wedding clothes  do not let them wait for that  but
tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them 
after they are married  and  above all  keep mr  bennet from fighting 
tell him what a dreadful state i am in  that i am frighted out of my
wits  and have such tremblings  such flutterings  all over me  such
spasms in my side and pains in my head  and such beatings at heart  that
i can get no rest by night nor by day  and tell my dear lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me  for she does
not know which are the best warehouses  oh  brother  how kind you are  i
know you will contrive it all  

but mr  gardiner  though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause  could not avoid recommending moderation to her  as well
in her hopes as her fear  and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table  they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper  who attended in the absence of her daughters 

though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family  they did not attempt to
oppose it  for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants  while they waited at table  and judged it
better that  one  only of the household  and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject 

in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and kitty  who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before  one came from her books  and the other from her toilette  the
faces of both  however  were tolerably calm  and no change was visible
in either  except that the loss of her favourite sister  or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business  had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty  as for mary  she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth  with a countenance
of grave reflection  soon after they were seated at table 

 this is a most unfortunate affair  and will probably be much talked of 
but we must stem the tide of malice  and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation  

then  perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying  she added 
 unhappy as the event must be for lydia  we may draw from it this useful
lesson  that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable  that one
false step involves her in endless ruin  that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful  and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex  

elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement  but was too much oppressed
to make any reply  mary  however  continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them 

in the afternoon  the two elder miss bennets were able to be for
half an hour by themselves  and elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries  which jane was equally eager to
satisfy  after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event  which elizabeth considered as all but certain  and miss
bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible  the former continued
the subject  by saying   but tell me all and everything about it which
i have not already heard  give me further particulars  what did colonel
forster say  had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place  they must have seen them together for ever  

 colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality 
especially on lydia   side  but nothing to give him any alarm  i am so
grieved for him  his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost  he
 was  coming to us  in order to assure us of his concern  before he had
any idea of their not being gone to scotland  when that apprehension
first got abroad  it hastened his journey  

 and was denny convinced that wickham would not marry  did he know of
their intending to go off  had colonel forster seen denny himself  

 yes  but  when questioned by  him   denny denied knowing anything of
their plans  and would not give his real opinion about it  he did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying  and from  that   i am
inclined to hope  he might have been misunderstood before  

 and till colonel forster came himself  not one of you entertained a
doubt  i suppose  of their being really married  

 how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains  i felt
a little uneasy  a little fearful of my sister   happiness with him
in marriage  because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right  my father and mother knew nothing of that  they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be  kitty then owned  with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us  that in lydia   last letter
she had prepared her for such a step  she had known  it seems  of their
being in love with each other  many weeks  

 but not before they went to brighton  

 no  i believe not  

 and did colonel forster appear to think well of wickham himself  does
he know his real character  

 i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly
did  he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant  and since this sad
affair has taken place  it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt 
but i hope this may be false  

 oh  jane  had we been less secret  had we told what we knew of him 
this could not have happened  

 perhaps it would have been better   replied her sister   but to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were  seemed unjustifiable  we acted with the best intentions  

 could colonel forster repeat the particulars of lydia   note to his
wife  

 he brought it with him for us to see  

jane then took it from her pocket book  and gave it to elizabeth  these
were the contents 

 my dear harriet 

 you will laugh when you know where i am gone  and i cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning  as soon as i am
missed  i am going to gretna green  and if you cannot guess with who 
i shall think you a simpleton  for there is but one man in the world i
love  and he is an angel  i should never be happy without him  so think
it no harm to be off  you need not send them word at longbourn of my
going  if you do not like it  for it will make the surprise the greater 
when i write to them and sign my name  lydia wickham   what a good joke
it will be  i can hardly write for laughing  pray make my excuses to
pratt for not keeping my engagement  and dancing with him to night 
tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all  and tell him i will
dance with him at the next ball we meet  with great pleasure  i shall
send for my clothes when i get to longbourn  but i wish you would tell
sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up  good bye  give my love to colonel forster  i hope you will
drink to our good journey 

 your affectionate friend 

 lydia bennet  

 oh  thoughtless  thoughtless lydia   cried elizabeth when she had
finished it   what a letter is this  to be written at such a moment 
but at least it shows that  she  was serious on the subject of their
journey  whatever he might afterwards persuade her to  it was not on her
side a  scheme  of infamy  my poor father  how he must have felt it  

 i never saw anyone so shocked  he could not speak a word for full ten
minutes  my mother was taken ill immediately  and the whole house in
such confusion  

 oh  jane   cried elizabeth   was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day  

 i do not know  i hope there was  but to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult  my mother was in hysterics  and though i endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power  i am afraid i did not do so
much as i might have done  but the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties  

 your attendance upon her has been too much for you  you do not look
well  oh that i had been with you  you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone  

 mary and kitty have been very kind  and would have shared in every
fatigue  i am sure  but i did not think it right for either of them 
kitty is slight and delicate  and mary studies so much  that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on  my aunt phillips came to longbourn
on tuesday  after my father went away  and was so good as to stay till
thursday with me  she was of great use and comfort to us all  and
lady lucas has been very kind  she walked here on wednesday morning to
condole with us  and offered her services  or any of her daughters   if
they should be of use to us  

 she had better have stayed at home   cried elizabeth   perhaps she
 meant  well  but  under such a misfortune as this  one cannot see
too little of one   neighbours  assistance is impossible  condolence
insufferable  let them triumph over us at a distance  and be satisfied  

she then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue  while in town  for the recovery of his daughter 

 he meant i believe   replied jane   to go to epsom  the place where
they last changed horses  see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them  his principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham  it had come
with a fare from london  and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady   removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at clapham  if he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare  he
determined to make inquiries there  and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach  i do not know of any
other designs that he had formed  but he was in such a hurry to be gone 
and his spirits so greatly discomposed  that i had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this  



chapter 48


the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr  bennet the next
morning  but the post came in without bringing a single line from him 
his family knew him to be  on all common occasions  a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent  but at such a time they had hoped for exertion 
they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send  but even of  that  they would have been glad to be certain  mr 
gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off 

when he was gone  they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on  and their uncle promised  at parting 
to prevail on mr  bennet to return to longbourn  as soon as he could 
to the great consolation of his sister  who considered it as the only
security for her husband   not being killed in a duel 

mrs  gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few
days longer  as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces  she shared in their attendance on mrs  bennet  and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom  their other aunt also
visited them frequently  and always  as she said  with the design of
cheering and heartening them up  though  as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of wickham   extravagance or irregularity 
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them 

all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who  but three months
before  had been almost an angel of light  he was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place  and his intrigues  all honoured with
the title of seduction  had been extended into every tradesman   family 
everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world 
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness  elizabeth  though she did not credit above
half of what was said  believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister   ruin more certain  and even jane  who believed still less
of it  became almost hopeless  more especially as the time was now come
when  if they had gone to scotland  which she had never before entirely
despaired of  they must in all probability have gained some news of
them 

mr  gardiner left longbourn on sunday  on tuesday his wife received a
letter from him  it told them that  on his arrival  he had immediately
found out his brother  and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street 
that mr  bennet had been to epsom and clapham  before his arrival 
but without gaining any satisfactory information  and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town  as mr  bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them  on their first
coming to london  before they procured lodgings  mr  gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure  but as his brother was
eager in it  he meant to assist him in pursuing it  he added that mr 
bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised
to write again very soon  there was also a postscript to this effect 

 i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out  if
possible  from some of the young man   intimates in the regiment 
whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself  if there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that  it might be of essential consequence  at present we have
nothing to guide us  colonel forster will  i dare say  do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head  but  on second thoughts  perhaps 
lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living  better than any
other person  

elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded  but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved  she had never
heard of his having had any relations  except a father and mother  both
of whom had been dead many years  it was possible  however  that some of
his companions in the     shire might be able to give more information 
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it  the application
was a something to look forward to 

every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety  but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected  the arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning   impatience  through letters 
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated  and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance 

but before they heard again from mr  gardiner  a letter arrived for
their father  from a different quarter  from mr  collins  which  as jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence 
she accordingly read  and elizabeth  who knew what curiosities his
letters always were  looked over her  and read it likewise  it was as
follows 

 my dear sir 

 i feel myself called upon  by our relationship  and my situation
in life  to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under  of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
hertfordshire  be assured  my dear sir  that mrs  collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family  in
your present distress  which must be of the bitterest kind  because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove  no arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune  or that
may comfort you  under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent   mind  the death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this  and it is the more to
be lamented  because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte
informs me  that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence  though  at the same time 
for the consolation of yourself and mrs  bennet  i am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad  or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity  at so early an age  howsoever that may be 
you are grievously to be pitied  in which opinion i am not only joined
by mrs  collins  but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter  to
whom i have related the affair  they agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others  for who  as lady catherine herself condescendingly says 
will connect themselves with such a family  and this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect  with augmented satisfaction  on a certain event
of last november  for had it been otherwise  i must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace  let me then advise you  dear sir  to
console yourself as much as possible  to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever  and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense 

 i am  dear sir  etc   etc  

mr  gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
colonel forster  and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send 
it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection  and it was certain that he had no near one
living  his former acquaintances had been numerous  but since he
had been in the militia  it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them  there was no one  therefore 
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him  and in the
wretched state of his own finances  there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy  in addition to his fear of discovery by lydia   relations  for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount  colonel forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton 
he owed a good deal in town  but his debts of honour were still more
formidable  mr  gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the longbourn family  jane heard them with horror   a gamester  
she cried   this is wholly unexpected  i had not an idea of it  

mr  gardiner added in his letter  that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day  which was saturday  rendered
spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours  he had yielded
to his brother in law   entreaty that he would return to his family  and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit  when mrs  bennet was told of this  she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected  considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before 

 what  is he coming home  and without poor lydia   she cried   sure he
will not leave london before he has found them  who is to fight wickham 
and make him marry her  if he comes away  

as mrs  gardiner began to wish to be at home  it was settled that she
and the children should go to london  at the same time that mr  bennet
came from it  the coach  therefore  took them the first stage of their
journey  and brought its master back to longbourn 

mrs  gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her
derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world  his
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece  and
the kind of half expectation which mrs  gardiner had formed  of their
being followed by a letter from him  had ended in nothing  elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from pemberley 

the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary  nothing  therefore  could be
fairly conjectured from  that   though elizabeth  who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings  was perfectly aware
that  had she known nothing of darcy  she could have borne the dread of
lydia   infamy somewhat better  it would have spared her  she thought 
one sleepless night out of two 

when mr  bennet arrived  he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure  he said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying  made no mention of the business that had taken him
away  and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it 

it was not till the afternoon  when he had joined them at tea  that
elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject  and then  on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured  he replied   say
nothing of that  who should suffer but myself  it has been my own doing 
and i ought to feel it  

 you must not be too severe upon yourself   replied elizabeth 

 you may well warn me against such an evil  human nature is so prone
to fall into it  no  lizzy  let me once in my life feel how much i have
been to blame  i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression 
it will pass away soon enough  

 do you suppose them to be in london  

 yes  where else can they be so well concealed  

 and lydia used to want to go to london   added kitty 

 she is happy then   said her father drily   and her residence there
will probably be of some duration  

then after a short silence he continued 

 lizzy  i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me
last may  which  considering the event  shows some greatness of mind  

they were interrupted by miss bennet  who came to fetch her mother  
tea 

 this is a parade   he cried   which does one good  it gives such an
elegance to misfortune  another day i will do the same  i will sit in my
library  in my nightcap and powdering gown  and give as much trouble as
i can  or  perhaps  i may defer it till kitty runs away  

 i am not going to run away  papa   said kitty fretfully   if i should
ever go to brighton  i would behave better than lydia  

  you  go to brighton  i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne
for fifty pounds  no  kitty  i have at last learnt to be cautious  and
you will feel the effects of it  no officer is ever to enter into
my house again  nor even to pass through the village  balls will be
absolutely prohibited  unless you stand up with one of your sisters 
and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner  

kitty  who took all these threats in a serious light  began to cry 

 well  well   said he   do not make yourself unhappy  if you are a good
girl for the next ten years  i will take you to a review at the end of
them  



chapter 49


two days after mr  bennet   return  as jane and elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house  they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them  and  concluding that she came to call them to their
mother  went forward to meet her  but  instead of the expected summons 
when they approached her  she said to miss bennet   i beg your pardon 
madam  for interrupting you  but i was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town  so i took the liberty of coming to ask  

 what do you mean  hill  we have heard nothing from town  

 dear madam   cried mrs  hill  in great astonishment   don   you know
there is an express come for master from mr  gardiner  he has been here
this half hour  and master has had a letter  

away ran the girls  too eager to get in to have time for speech  they
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room  from thence to the
library  their father was in neither  and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother  when they were met by the
butler  who said 

 if you are looking for my master  ma am  he is walking towards the
little copse  

upon this information  they instantly passed through the hall once
more  and ran across the lawn after their father  who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock 

jane  who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
elizabeth  soon lagged behind  while her sister  panting for breath 
came up with him  and eagerly cried out 

 oh  papa  what news  what news  have you heard from my uncle  

 yes i have had a letter from him by express  

 well  and what news does it bring  good or bad  

 what is there of good to be expected   said he  taking the letter from
his pocket   but perhaps you would like to read it  

elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand  jane now came up 

 read it aloud   said their father   for i hardly know myself what it is
about  

 gracechurch street  monday  august 2 

 my dear brother 

 at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece  and such as 
upon the whole  i hope it will give you satisfaction  soon after you
left me on saturday  i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
london they were  the particulars i reserve till we meet  it is enough
to know they are discovered  i have seen them both   

 then it is as i always hoped   cried jane   they are married  

elizabeth read on 

 i have seen them both  they are not married  nor can i find there
was any intention of being so  but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which i have ventured to make on your side  i hope it will
not be long before they are  all that is required of you is  to assure
to your daughter  by settlement  her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister  and  moreover  to enter into an engagement of allowing her 
during your life  one hundred pounds per annum  these are conditions
which  considering everything  i had no hesitation in complying with 
as far as i thought myself privileged  for you  i shall send this by
express  that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer  you
will easily comprehend  from these particulars  that mr  wickham  
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be 
the world has been deceived in that respect  and i am happy to say there
will be some little money  even when all his debts are discharged  to
settle on my niece  in addition to her own fortune  if  as i conclude
will be the case  you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business  i will immediately give directions to
haggerston for preparing a proper settlement  there will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again  therefore stay quiet at
longbourn  and depend on my diligence and care  send back your answer as
fast as you can  and be careful to write explicitly  we have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house  of which i hope
you will approve  she comes to us to day  i shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on  yours  etc  

 edw  gardiner  

 is it possible   cried elizabeth  when she had finished   can it be
possible that he will marry her  

 wickham is not so undeserving  then  as we thought him   said her
sister   my dear father  i congratulate you  

 and have you answered the letter   cried elizabeth 

 no  but it must be done soon  

most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he
wrote 

 oh  my dear father   she cried   come back and write immediately 
consider how important every moment is in such a case  

 let me write for you   said jane   if you dislike the trouble
yourself  

 i dislike it very much   he replied   but it must be done  

and so saying  he turned back with them  and walked towards the house 

 and may i ask    said elizabeth   but the terms  i suppose  must be
complied with  

 complied with  i am only ashamed of his asking so little  

 and they  must  marry  yet he is  such  a man  

 yes  yes  they must marry  there is nothing else to be done  but there
are two things that i want very much to know  one is  how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about  and the other  how am i ever
to pay him  

 money  my uncle   cried jane   what do you mean  sir  

 i mean  that no man in his senses would marry lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life  and fifty after i am
gone  

 that is very true   said elizabeth   though it had not occurred to me
before  his debts to be discharged  and something still to remain  oh 
it must be my uncle   doings  generous  good man  i am afraid he has
distressed himself  a small sum could not do all this  

 no   said her father   wickham   a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds  i should be sorry to think so ill of him 
in the very beginning of our relationship  

 ten thousand pounds  heaven forbid  how is half such a sum to be
repaid  

mr  bennet made no answer  and each of them  deep in thought  continued
silent till they reached the house  their father then went on to the
library to write  and the girls walked into the breakfast room 

 and they are really to be married   cried elizabeth  as soon as they
were by themselves   how strange this is  and for  this  we are to be
thankful  that they should marry  small as is their chance of happiness 
and wretched as is his character  we are forced to rejoice  oh  lydia  

 i comfort myself with thinking   replied jane   that he certainly would
not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her  though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him  i cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds  or anything like it  has been advanced  he has children
of his own  and may have more  how could he spare half ten thousand
pounds  

 if he were ever able to learn what wickham   debts have been   said
elizabeth   and how much is settled on his side on our sister  we shall
exactly know what mr  gardiner has done for them  because wickham has
not sixpence of his own  the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited  their taking her home  and affording her their personal
protection and countenance  is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge  by this time she is
actually with them  if such goodness does not make her miserable now 
she will never deserve to be happy  what a meeting for her  when she
first sees my aunt  

 we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side   said
jane   i hope and trust they will yet be happy  his consenting to
marry her is a proof  i will believe  that he is come to a right way of
thinking  their mutual affection will steady them  and i flatter myself
they will settle so quietly  and live in so rational a manner  as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten  

 their conduct has been such   replied elizabeth   as neither you  nor
i  nor anybody can ever forget  it is useless to talk of it  

it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened  they went to the library 
therefore  and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her  he was writing and  without raising his head  coolly
replied 

 just as you please  

 may we take my uncle   letter to read to her  

 take whatever you like  and get away  

elizabeth took the letter from his writing table  and they went up stairs
together  mary and kitty were both with mrs  bennet  one communication
would  therefore  do for all  after a slight preparation for good news 
the letter was read aloud  mrs  bennet could hardly contain herself  as
soon as jane had read mr  gardiner   hope of lydia   being soon
married  her joy burst forth  and every following sentence added to its
exuberance  she was now in an irritation as violent from delight  as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation  to know that her daughter
would be married was enough  she was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity  nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct 

 my dear  dear lydia   she cried   this is delightful indeed  she will
be married  i shall see her again  she will be married at sixteen 
my good  kind brother  i knew how it would be  i knew he would manage
everything  how i long to see her  and to see dear wickham too  but the
clothes  the wedding clothes  i will write to my sister gardiner about
them directly  lizzy  my dear  run down to your father  and ask him
how much he will give her  stay  stay  i will go myself  ring the bell 
kitty  for hill  i will put on my things in a moment  my dear  dear
lydia  how merry we shall be together when we meet  

her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports  by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr 
gardiner   behaviour laid them all under 

 for we must attribute this happy conclusion   she added   in a great
measure to his kindness  we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist mr  wickham with money  

 well   cried her mother   it is all very right  who should do it but
her own uncle  if he had not had a family of his own  i and my children
must have had all his money  you know  and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him  except a few presents  well  i am so happy 
in a short time i shall have a daughter married  mrs  wickham  how well
it sounds  and she was only sixteen last june  my dear jane  i am in
such a flutter  that i am sure i can   write  so i will dictate  and
you write for me  we will settle with your father about the money
afterwards  but the things should be ordered immediately  

she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico  muslin  and
cambric  and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders  had
not jane  though with some difficulty  persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted  one day   delay  she observed 
would be of small importance  and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual  other schemes  too  came into her head 

 i will go to meryton   said she   as soon as i am dressed  and tell the
good  good news to my sister philips  and as i come back  i can call
on lady lucas and mrs  long  kitty  run down and order the carriage 
an airing would do me a great deal of good  i am sure  girls  can i do
anything for you in meryton  oh  here comes hill  my dear hill  have you
heard the good news  miss lydia is going to be married  and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding  

mrs  hill began instantly to express her joy  elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest  and then  sick of this folly  took
refuge in her own room  that she might think with freedom 

poor lydia   situation must  at best  be bad enough  but that it was
no worse  she had need to be thankful  she felt it so  and though  in
looking forward  neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister  in looking back to what they had
feared  only two hours ago  she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained 



chapter 50


mr  bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that 
instead of spending his whole income  he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children  and of his wife  if she survived
him  he now wished it more than ever  had he done his duty in that
respect  lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her  the satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place 

he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother in law  and he
was determined  if possible  to find out the extent of his assistance 
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could 

when first mr  bennet had married  economy was held to be perfectly
useless  for  of course  they were to have a son  the son was to join
in cutting off the entail  as soon as he should be of age  and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for  five daughters
successively entered the world  but yet the son was to come  and mrs 
bennet  for many years after lydia   birth  had been certain that he
would  this event had at last been despaired of  but it was then
too late to be saving  mrs  bennet had no turn for economy  and her
husband   love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income 

five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs  bennet and
the children  but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents  this was one point  with
regard to lydia  at least  which was now to be settled  and mr  bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him  in
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother 
though expressed most concisely  he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done  and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him  he had never before supposed
that  could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter  it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement  he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them  for  what with her board and pocket
allowance  and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother   hands  lydia   expenses had been very little within
that sum 

that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side  too  was
another very welcome surprise  for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible  when the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over  he
naturally returned to all his former indolence  his letter was soon
dispatched  for  though dilatory in undertaking business  he was quick
in its execution  he begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother  but was too angry with lydia to send any
message to her 

the good news spread quickly through the house  and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood  it was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy  to be sure  it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town  or  as the
happiest alternative  been secluded from the world  in some distant
farmhouse  but there was much to be talked of in marrying her  and the
good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances  because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain 

it was a fortnight since mrs  bennet had been downstairs  but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table  and in
spirits oppressively high  no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph  the marriage of a daughter  which had been the first object
of her wishes since jane was sixteen  was now on the point of
accomplishment  and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials  fine muslins  new carriages  and
servants  she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter  and  without knowing or considering
what their income might be  rejected many as deficient in size and
importance 

 haye park might do   said she   if the gouldings could quit it  or the
great house at stoke  if the drawing room were larger  but ashworth is
too far off  i could not bear to have her ten miles from me  and as for
pulvis lodge  the attics are dreadful  

her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained  but when they had withdrawn  he said to her   mrs 
bennet  before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter  let us come to a right understanding  into  one  house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance  i will not encourage the
impudence of either  by receiving them at longbourn  

a long dispute followed this declaration  but mr  bennet was firm  it
soon led to another  and mrs  bennet found  with amazement and horror 
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter  he protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion  mrs  bennet could hardly comprehend
it  that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid  exceeded all she could believe
possible  she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter   nuptials  than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they
took place 

elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had  from the distress of
the moment  been led to make mr  darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister  for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement  they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot 

she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means  there were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended 
but  at the same time  there was no one whose knowledge of a sister  
frailty would have mortified her so much  not  however  from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself  for  at any rate 
there seemed a gulf impassable between them  had lydia   marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms  it was not to be supposed that
mr  darcy would connect himself with a family where  to every other
objection  would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned 

from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink  the
wish of procuring her regard  which she had assured herself of his
feeling in derbyshire  could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this  she was humbled  she was grieved  she repented  though she
hardly knew of what  she became jealous of his esteem  when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it  she wanted to hear of him  when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence  she was convinced that
she could have been happy with him  when it was no longer likely they
should meet 

what a triumph for him  as she often thought  could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago  would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received  he was as generous  she
doubted not  as the most generous of his sex  but while he was mortal 
there must be a triumph 

she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who  in
disposition and talents  would most suit her  his understanding and
temper  though unlike her own  would have answered all her wishes  it
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both  by her ease
and liveliness  his mind might have been softened  his manners improved 
and from his judgement  information  and knowledge of the world  she
must have received benefit of greater importance 

but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was  an union of a different tendency  and
precluding the possibility of the other  was soon to be formed in their
family 

how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence 
she could not imagine  but how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue  she could easily conjecture 

                                   

mr  gardiner soon wrote again to his brother  to mr  bennet  
acknowledgments he briefly replied  with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family  and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again  the principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that mr  wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia 

 it was greatly my wish that he should do so   he added   as soon as
his marriage was fixed on  and i think you will agree with me  in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable  both on
his account and my niece    it is mr  wickham   intention to go into
the regulars  and among his former friends  there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army  he has the promise of an
ensigncy in general        regiment  now quartered in the north  it
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom  he
promises fairly  and i hope among different people  where they may each
have a character to preserve  they will both be more prudent  i have
written to colonel forster  to inform him of our present arrangements 
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr  wickham
in and near brighton  with assurances of speedy payment  for which i
have pledged myself  and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in meryton  of whom i shall subjoin
a list according to his information  he has given in all his debts  i
hope at least he has not deceived us  haggerston has our directions 
and all will be completed in a week  they will then join his regiment 
unless they are first invited to longbourn  and i understand from mrs 
gardiner  that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the south  she is well  and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and your mother   yours  etc  

    gardiner  

mr  bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickham   removal
from the     shire as clearly as mr  gardiner could do  but mrs  bennet
was not so well pleased with it  lydia   being settled in the north 
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company 
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
hertfordshire  was a severe disappointment  and  besides  it was such a
pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody  and had so many favourites 

 she is so fond of mrs  forster   said she   it will be quite shocking
to send her away  and there are several of the young men  too  that she
likes very much  the officers may not be so pleasant in general       
regiment  

his daughter   request  for such it might be considered  of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the north 
received at first an absolute negative  but jane and elizabeth 
who agreed in wishing  for the sake of their sister   feelings and
consequence  that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents 
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly  to receive her
and her husband at longbourn  as soon as they were married  that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought  and act as they wished  and their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
north  when mr  bennet wrote again to his brother  therefore  he sent
his permission for them to come  and it was settled  that as soon as
the ceremony was over  they should proceed to longbourn  elizabeth was
surprised  however  that wickham should consent to such a scheme  and
had she consulted only her own inclination  any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes 



chapter 51


their sister   wedding day arrived  and jane and elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself  the carriage was sent to
meet them at       and they were to return in it by dinner time  their
arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets  and jane more especially 
who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself  had she
been the culprit  and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure 

they came  the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them  smiles decked the face of mrs  bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door  her husband looked impenetrably grave  her daughters  alarmed 
anxious  uneasy 

lydia   voice was heard in the vestibule  the door was thrown open  and
she ran into the room  her mother stepped forwards  embraced her  and
welcomed her with rapture  gave her hand  with an affectionate smile 
to wickham  who followed his lady  and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness 

their reception from mr  bennet  to whom they then turned  was not quite
so cordial  his countenance rather gained in austerity  and he scarcely
opened his lips  the easy assurance of the young couple  indeed  was
enough to provoke him  elizabeth was disgusted  and even miss bennet
was shocked  lydia was lydia still  untamed  unabashed  wild  noisy 
and fearless  she turned from sister to sister  demanding their
congratulations  and when at length they all sat down  looked eagerly
round the room  took notice of some little alteration in it  and
observed  with a laugh  that it was a great while since she had been
there 

wickham was not at all more distressed than herself  but his manners
were always so pleasing  that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought  his smiles and his easy address  while he
claimed their relationship  would have delighted them all  elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance  but she sat down 
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man  she blushed  and jane blushed  but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour 

there was no want of discourse  the bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough  and wickham  who happened to sit near
elizabeth  began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood 
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies  they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world  nothing of the past was recollected with pain  and lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world 

 only think of its being three months   she cried   since i went away 
it seems but a fortnight i declare  and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time  good gracious  when i went away  i am sure
i had no more idea of being married till i came back again  though i
thought it would be very good fun if i was  

her father lifted up his eyes  jane was distressed  elizabeth looked
expressively at lydia  but she  who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible  gaily continued   oh  mamma  do the
people hereabouts know i am married to day  i was afraid they might not 
and we overtook william goulding in his curricle  so i was determined he
should know it  and so i let down the side glass next to him  and took
off my glove  and let my hand just rest upon the window frame  so that
he might see the ring  and then i bowed and smiled like anything  

elizabeth could bear it no longer  she got up  and ran out of the room 
and returned no more  till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour  she then joined them soon enough to see lydia  with
anxious parade  walk up to her mother   right hand  and hear her say
to her eldest sister   ah  jane  i take your place now  and you must go
lower  because i am a married woman  

it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first  her ease and good
spirits increased  she longed to see mrs  phillips  the lucases  and
all their other neighbours  and to hear herself called  mrs  wickham 
by each of them  and in the mean time  she went after dinner to show her
ring  and boast of being married  to mrs  hill and the two housemaids 

 well  mamma   said she  when they were all returned to the breakfast
room   and what do you think of my husband  is not he a charming man  i
am sure my sisters must all envy me  i only hope they may have half
my good luck  they must all go to brighton  that is the place to get
husbands  what a pity it is  mamma  we did not all go  

 very true  and if i had my will  we should  but my dear lydia  i don  
at all like your going such a way off  must it be so  

 oh  lord  yes   there is nothing in that  i shall like it of all
things  you and papa  and my sisters  must come down and see us  we
shall be at newcastle all the winter  and i dare say there will be some
balls  and i will take care to get good partners for them all  

 i should like it beyond anything   said her mother 

 and then when you go away  you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you  and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over  

 i thank you for my share of the favour   said elizabeth   but i do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands  

their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them  mr  wickham
had received his commission before he left london  and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight 

no one but mrs  bennet regretted that their stay would be so short  and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter  and
having very frequent parties at home  these parties were acceptable to
all  to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think  than such as did not 

wickham   affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected
to find it  not equal to lydia   for him  she had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied  from the reason of things  that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love  rather
than by his  and she would have wondered why  without violently caring
for her  he chose to elope with her at all  had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances  and
if that were the case  he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion 

lydia was exceedingly fond of him  he was her dear wickham on every
occasion  no one was to be put in competition with him  he did every
thing best in the world  and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of september  than any body else in the country 

one morning  soon after their arrival  as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters  she said to elizabeth 

 lizzy  i never gave  you  an account of my wedding  i believe  you
were not by  when i told mamma and the others all about it  are not you
curious to hear how it was managed  

 no really   replied elizabeth   i think there cannot be too little said
on the subject  

 la  you are so strange  but i must tell you how it went off  we were
married  you know  at st  clement    because wickham   lodgings were in
that parish  and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o clock  my uncle and aunt and i were to go together  and the others
were to meet us at the church  well  monday morning came  and i was in
such a fuss  i was so afraid  you know  that something would happen to
put it off  and then i should have gone quite distracted  and there was
my aunt  all the time i was dressing  preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon  however  i did not hear above one word in
ten  for i was thinking  you may suppose  of my dear wickham  i longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat  

 well  and so we breakfasted at ten as usual  i thought it would never
be over  for  by the bye  you are to understand  that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them  if you ll believe
me  i did not once put my foot out of doors  though i was there a
fortnight  not one party  or scheme  or anything  to be sure london was
rather thin  but  however  the little theatre was open  well  and so
just as the carriage came to the door  my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man mr  stone  and then  you know  when once
they get together  there is no end of it  well  i was so frightened i
did not know what to do  for my uncle was to give me away  and if we
were beyond the hour  we could not be married all day  but  luckily  he
came back again in ten minutes  time  and then we all set out  however 
i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going  the
wedding need not be put off  for mr  darcy might have done as well  

 mr  darcy   repeated elizabeth  in utter amazement 

 oh  yes   he was to come there with wickham  you know  but gracious
me  i quite forgot  i ought not to have said a word about it  i promised
them so faithfully  what will wickham say  it was to be such a secret  

 if it was to be secret   said jane   say not another word on the
subject  you may depend upon my seeking no further  

 oh  certainly   said elizabeth  though burning with curiosity   we will
ask you no questions  

 thank you   said lydia   for if you did  i should certainly tell you
all  and then wickham would be angry  

on such encouragement to ask  elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power  by running away 

but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible  or at least
it was impossible not to try for information  mr  darcy had been at
her sister   wedding  it was exactly a scene  and exactly among people 
where he had apparently least to do  and least temptation to go 
conjectures as to the meaning of it  rapid and wild  hurried into her
brain  but she was satisfied with none  those that best pleased her  as
placing his conduct in the noblest light  seemed most improbable  she
could not bear such suspense  and hastily seizing a sheet of paper 
wrote a short letter to her aunt  to request an explanation of what
lydia had dropt  if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended 

 you may readily comprehend   she added   what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us  and  comparatively
speaking  a stranger to our family  should have been amongst you at such
a time  pray write instantly  and let me understand it  unless it is 
for very cogent reasons  to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems
to think necessary  and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance  

 not that i  shall   though   she added to herself  as she finished
the letter   and my dear aunt  if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner  i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out  

jane   delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall  elizabeth was glad
of it   till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction  she had rather be without a confidante 



chapter 52


elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could  she was no sooner in possession of it
than  hurrying into the little copse  where she was least likely to
be interrupted  she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy  for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial 

 gracechurch street  sept  6 

 my dear niece 

 i have just received your letter  and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it  as i foresee that a  little  writing will not comprise
what i have to tell you  i must confess myself surprised by your
application  i did not expect it from  you   don   think me angry 
however  for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on  your  side  if you do not choose to
understand me  forgive my impertinence  your uncle is as much surprised
as i am  and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done  but if you are really
innocent and ignorant  i must be more explicit 

 on the very day of my coming home from longbourn  your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor  mr  darcy called  and was shut up with him several
hours  it was all over before i arrived  so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as  yours  seems to have been  he came to tell mr 
gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr  wickham were 
and that he had seen and talked with them both  wickham repeatedly 
lydia once  from what i can collect  he left derbyshire only one day
after ourselves  and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them  the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that wickham   worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him  he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride  and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world  his character was to speak for itself  he
called it  therefore  his duty to step forward  and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself  if he  had another 
motive  i am sure it would never disgrace him  he had been some days
in town  before he was able to discover them  but he had something to
direct his search  which was more than  we  had  and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us 

 there is a lady  it seems  a mrs  younge  who was some time ago
governess to miss darcy  and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation  though he did not say what  she then took a large
house in edward street  and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings  this mrs  younge was  he knew  intimately acquainted with
wickham  and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town  but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted  she would not betray her trust  i suppose  without bribery and
corruption  for she really did know where her friend was to be found 
wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london  and had
she been able to receive them into her house  they would have taken up
their abode with her  at length  however  our kind friend procured the
wished for direction  they were in      street  he saw wickham  and
afterwards insisted on seeing lydia  his first object with her  he
acknowledged  had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation  and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her  offering his assistance  as far as it would go  but
he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was  she cared
for none of her friends  she wanted no help of his  she would not hear
of leaving wickham  she was sure they should be married some time or
other  and it did not much signify when  since such were her feelings 
it only remained  he thought  to secure and expedite a marriage  which 
in his very first conversation with wickham  he easily learnt had never
been  his  design  he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment 
on account of some debts of honour  which were very pressing  and
scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of lydia   flight on her
own folly alone  he meant to resign his commission immediately  and as
to his future situation  he could conjecture very little about it  he
must go somewhere  but he did not know where  and he knew he should have
nothing to live on 

 mr  darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once  though
mr  bennet was not imagined to be very rich  he would have been able
to do something for him  and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage  but he found  in reply to this question  that wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country  under such circumstances  however  he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief 

 they met several times  for there was much to be discussed  wickham of
course wanted more than he could get  but at length was reduced to be
reasonable 

 every thing being settled between  them   mr  darcy   next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it  and he first called in gracechurch
street the evening before i came home  but mr  gardiner could not be
seen  and mr  darcy found  on further inquiry  that your father was
still with him  but would quit town the next morning  he did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle  and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former  he did not leave his name  and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business 

 on saturday he came again  your father was gone  your uncle at home 
and  as i said before  they had a great deal of talk together 

 they met again on sunday  and then  i  saw him too  it was not all
settled before monday  as soon as it was  the express was sent off to
longbourn  but our visitor was very obstinate  i fancy  lizzy  that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character  after all  he has been
accused of many faults at different times  but  this  is the true one 
nothing was to be done that he did not do himself  though i am sure  and
i do not speak it to be thanked  therefore say nothing about it   your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole 

 they battled it together for a long time  which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved  but at last your uncle
was forced to yield  and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece  was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it 
which went sorely against the grain  and i really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure  because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers  and give the praise where
it was due  but  lizzy  this must go no farther than yourself  or jane
at most 

 you know pretty well  i suppose  what has been done for the young
people  his debts are to be paid  amounting  i believe  to considerably
more than a thousand pounds  another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon  her   and his commission purchased  the reason why all
this was to be done by him alone  was such as i have given above  it
was owing to him  to his reserve and want of proper consideration  that
wickham   character had been so misunderstood  and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was  perhaps there was some truth
in  this   though i doubt whether  his  reserve  or  anybody    reserve 
can be answerable for the event  but in spite of all this fine talking 
my dear lizzy  you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded  if we had not given him credit for  another
interest  in the affair 

 when all this was resolved on  he returned again to his friends  who
were still staying at pemberley  but it was agreed that he should be in
london once more when the wedding took place  and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish 

 i believe i have now told you every thing  it is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise  i hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure  lydia came to us  and wickham had constant
admission to the house   he  was exactly what he had been  when i
knew him in hertfordshire  but i would not tell you how little i was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us  if i had not
perceived  by jane   letter last wednesday  that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it  and therefore what i now tell
you can give you no fresh pain  i talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner  representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done  and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family  if she
heard me  it was by good luck  for i am sure she did not listen  i was
sometimes quite provoked  but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and
jane  and for their sakes had patience with her 

 mr  darcy was punctual in his return  and as lydia informed you 
attended the wedding  he dined with us the next day  and was to leave
town again on wednesday or thursday  will you be very angry with me  my
dear lizzy  if i take this opportunity of saying  what i was never bold
enough to say before  how much i like him  his behaviour to us has 
in every respect  been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire  his
understanding and opinions all please me  he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness  and  that   if he marry  prudently   his wife may teach
him  i thought him very sly   he hardly ever mentioned your name  but
slyness seems the fashion 

 pray forgive me if i have been very presuming  or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from    i shall never be quite happy
till i have been all round the park  a low phaeton  with a nice little
pair of ponies  would be the very thing 

 but i must write no more  the children have been wanting me this half
hour 

 yours  very sincerely 

    gardiner  

the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits 
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share  the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what mr  darcy might have been doing to forward her sister  
match  which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable  and at the same time dreaded to be just  from the
pain of obligation  were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true 
he had followed them purposely to town  he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research  in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise  and where he was reduced to meet  frequently meet  reason
with  persuade  and finally bribe  the man whom he always most wished to
avoid  and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce  he had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem  her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her  but it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations  and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient  when required to depend on his affection for her  for
a woman who had already refused him  as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham  brother in law
of wickham  every kind of pride must revolt from the connection  he had 
to be sure  done much  she was ashamed to think how much  but he had
given a reason for his interference  which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief  it was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong  he had liberality  and he had the means of exercising it  and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement  she
could  perhaps  believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned  it was painful  exceedingly painful  to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return  they
owed the restoration of lydia  her character  every thing  to him  oh 
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged  every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him  for
herself she was humbled  but she was proud of him  proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour  he had been able to get the better of himself 
she read over her aunt   commendation of him again and again  it
was hardly enough  but it pleased her  she was even sensible of some
pleasure  though mixed with regret  on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between mr  darcy and herself 

she was roused from her seat  and her reflections  by some one  
approach  and before she could strike into another path  she was
overtaken by wickham 

 i am afraid i interrupt your solitary ramble  my dear sister   said he 
as he joined her 

 you certainly do   she replied with a smile   but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome  

 i should be sorry indeed  if it were  we were always good friends  and
now we are better  

 true  are the others coming out  

 i do not know  mrs  bennet and lydia are going in the carriage to
meryton  and so  my dear sister  i find  from our uncle and aunt  that
you have actually seen pemberley  

she replied in the affirmative 

 i almost envy you the pleasure  and yet i believe it would be too much
for me  or else i could take it in my way to newcastle  and you saw the
old housekeeper  i suppose  poor reynolds  she was always very fond of
me  but of course she did not mention my name to you  

 yes  she did  

 and what did she say  

 that you were gone into the army  and she was afraid had  not turned
out well  at such a distance as  that   you know  things are strangely
misrepresented  

 certainly   he replied  biting his lips  elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him  but he soon afterwards said 

 i was surprised to see darcy in town last month  we passed each other
several times  i wonder what he can be doing there  

 perhaps preparing for his marriage with miss de bourgh   said
elizabeth   it must be something particular  to take him there at this
time of year  

 undoubtedly  did you see him while you were at lambton  i thought i
understood from the gardiners that you had  

 yes  he introduced us to his sister  

 and do you like her  

 very much  

 i have heard  indeed  that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two  when i last saw her  she was not very promising  i am very glad
you liked her  i hope she will turn out well  

 i dare say she will  she has got over the most trying age  

 did you go by the village of kympton  

 i do not recollect that we did  

 i mention it  because it is the living which i ought to have had  a
most delightful place   excellent parsonage house  it would have suited
me in every respect  

 how should you have liked making sermons  

 exceedingly well  i should have considered it as part of my duty 
and the exertion would soon have been nothing  one ought not to
repine   but  to be sure  it would have been such a thing for me  the
quiet  the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness  but it was not to be  did you ever hear darcy mention the
circumstance  when you were in kent  

 i have heard from authority  which i thought  as good   that it was
left you conditionally only  and at the will of the present patron  

 you have  yes  there was something in  that   i told you so from the
first  you may remember  

 i  did  hear  too  that there was a time  when sermon making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present  that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders  and that the business
had been compromised accordingly  

 you did  and it was not wholly without foundation  you may remember
what i told you on that point  when first we talked of it  

they were now almost at the door of the house  for she had walked fast
to get rid of him  and unwilling  for her sister   sake  to provoke him 
she only said in reply  with a good humoured smile 

 come  mr  wickham  we are brother and sister  you know  do not let
us quarrel about the past  in future  i hope we shall be always of one
mind  

she held out her hand  he kissed it with affectionate gallantry  though
he hardly knew how to look  and they entered the house 



chapter 53


mr  wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself  or provoked his dear sister elizabeth 
by introducing the subject of it  and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet 

the day of his and lydia   departure soon came  and mrs  bennet was
forced to submit to a separation  which  as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle  was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth 

 oh  my dear lydia   she cried   when shall we meet again  

 oh  lord  i don   know  not these two or three years  perhaps  

 write to me very often  my dear  

 as often as i can  but you know married women have never much time for
writing  my sisters may write to  me   they will have nothing else to
do  

mr  wickham   adieus were much more affectionate than his wife    he
smiled  looked handsome  and said many pretty things 

 he is as fine a fellow   said mr  bennet  as soon as they were out of
the house   as ever i saw  he simpers  and smirks  and makes love to
us all  i am prodigiously proud of him  i defy even sir william lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son in law  

the loss of her daughter made mrs  bennet very dull for several days 

 i often think   said she   that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one   friends  one seems so forlorn without them  

 this is the consequence  you see  madam  of marrying a daughter   said
elizabeth   it must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single  

 it is no such thing  lydia does not leave me because she is married 
but only because her husband   regiment happens to be so far off  if
that had been nearer  she would not have gone so soon  

but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved  and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope  by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation  the housekeeper
at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master  who was coming down in a day or two  to shoot there for several
weeks  mrs  bennet was quite in the fidgets  she looked at jane  and
smiled and shook her head by turns 

 well  well  and so mr  bingley is coming down  sister    for mrs 
phillips first brought her the news    well  so much the better  not
that i care about it  though  he is nothing to us  you know  and i am
sure  i  never want to see him again  but  however  he is very welcome
to come to netherfield  if he likes it  and who knows what  may  happen 
but that is nothing to us  you know  sister  we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it  and so  is it quite certain he is coming  

 you may depend on it   replied the other   for mrs  nicholls was in
meryton last night  i saw her passing by  and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it  and she told me that it was certain true  he
comes down on thursday at the latest  very likely on wednesday  she was
going to the butcher    she told me  on purpose to order in some meat on
wednesday  and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed  

miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour  it was many months since she had mentioned his name to
elizabeth  but now  as soon as they were alone together  she said 

 i saw you look at me to day  lizzy  when my aunt told us of the present
report  and i know i appeared distressed  but don   imagine it was from
any silly cause  i was only confused for the moment  because i felt that
i  should  be looked at  i do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain  i am glad of one thing  that he comes
alone  because we shall see the less of him  not that i am afraid of
 myself   but i dread other people   remarks  

elizabeth did not know what to make of it  had she not seen him in
derbyshire  she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged  but she still thought him partial
to jane  and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there  with  his friend   permission  or being bold enough to come
without it 

 yet it is hard   she sometimes thought   that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired  without raising all this
speculation  i  will  leave him to himself  

in spite of what her sister declared  and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival  elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it  they were more disturbed 
more unequal  than she had often seen them 

the subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents 
about a twelvemonth ago  was now brought forward again 

 as soon as ever mr  bingley comes  my dear   said mrs  bennet   you
will wait on him of course  

 no  no  you forced me into visiting him last year  and promised  if i
went to see him  he should marry one of my daughters  but it ended in
nothing  and i will not be sent on a fool   errand again  

his wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen  on his returning to
netherfield 

  tis an etiquette i despise   said he   if he wants our society 
let him seek it  he knows where we live  i will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again  

 well  all i know is  that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him  but  however  that shan   prevent my asking him to dine here  i
am determined  we must have mrs  long and the gouldings soon  that will
make thirteen with ourselves  so there will be just room at table for
him  

consoled by this resolution  she was the better able to bear her
husband   incivility  though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see mr  bingley  in consequence of it  before
 they  did  as the day of his arrival drew near   

 i begin to be sorry that he comes at all   said jane to her sister   it
would be nothing  i could see him with perfect indifference  but i can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of  my mother means well 
but she does not know  no one can know  how much i suffer from what she
says  happy shall i be  when his stay at netherfield is over  

 i wish i could say anything to comfort you   replied elizabeth   but it
is wholly out of my power  you must feel it  and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me  because you have
always so much  

mr  bingley arrived  mrs  bennet  through the assistance of servants 
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it  that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could  she counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent 
hopeless of seeing him before  but on the third morning after his
arrival in hertfordshire  she saw him  from her dressing room window 
enter the paddock and ride towards the house 

her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy  jane resolutely
kept her place at the table  but elizabeth  to satisfy her mother  went
to the window  she looked   she saw mr  darcy with him  and sat down
again by her sister 

 there is a gentleman with him  mamma   said kitty   who can it be  

 some acquaintance or other  my dear  i suppose  i am sure i do not
know  

 la   replied kitty   it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before  mr  what   his name  that tall  proud man  

 good gracious  mr  darcy   and so it does  i vow  well  any friend of
mr  bingley   will always be welcome here  to be sure  but else i must
say that i hate the very sight of him  

jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern  she knew but little
of their meeting in derbyshire  and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister  in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter  both sisters were uncomfortable
enough  each felt for the other  and of course for themselves  and their
mother talked on  of her dislike of mr  darcy  and her resolution to be
civil to him only as mr  bingley   friend  without being heard by either
of them  but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by jane  to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs 
gardiner   letter  or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him 
to jane  he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused 
and whose merit she had undervalued  but to her own more extensive
information  he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits  and whom she regarded herself with an
interest  if not quite so tender  at least as reasonable and just as
what jane felt for bingley  her astonishment at his coming  at his
coming to netherfield  to longbourn  and voluntarily seeking her again 
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in derbyshire 

the colour which had been driven from her face  returned for half a
minute with an additional glow  and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes  as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken  but she would not be secure 

 let me first see how he behaves   said she   it will then be early
enough for expectation  

she sat intently at work  striving to be composed  and without daring to
lift up her eyes  till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door  jane looked a little
paler than usual  but more sedate than elizabeth had expected  on the
gentlemen   appearing  her colour increased  yet she received them with
tolerable ease  and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance 

elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow  and sat down
again to her work  with an eagerness which it did not often command  she
had ventured only one glance at darcy  he looked serious  as usual  and 
she thought  more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire  than as
she had seen him at pemberley  but  perhaps he could not in her mother  
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt  it was a painful  but
not an improbable  conjecture 

bingley  she had likewise seen for an instant  and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed  he was received by mrs 
bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed 
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend 

elizabeth  particularly  who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy 
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied 

darcy  after inquiring of her how mr  and mrs  gardiner did  a question
which she could not answer without confusion  said scarcely anything  he
was not seated by her  perhaps that was the reason of his silence  but
it had not been so in derbyshire  there he had talked to her friends 
when he could not to herself  but now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice  and when occasionally  unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity  she raised her eyes to his face  she as often
found him looking at jane as at herself  and frequently on no object but
the ground  more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please  than when
they last met  were plainly expressed  she was disappointed  and angry
with herself for being so 

 could i expect it to be otherwise   said she   yet why did he come  

she was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself  and to
him she had hardly courage to speak 

she inquired after his sister  but could do no more 

 it is a long time  mr  bingley  since you went away   said mrs  bennet 

he readily agreed to it 

 i began to be afraid you would never come back again  people  did  say
you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas  but  however  i hope
it is not true  a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood 
since you went away  miss lucas is married and settled  and one of my
own daughters  i suppose you have heard of it  indeed  you must have
seen it in the papers  it was in the times and the courier  i know 
though it was not put in as it ought to be  it was only said   lately 
george wickham  esq  to miss lydia bennet   without there being a
syllable said of her father  or the place where she lived  or anything 
it was my brother gardiner   drawing up too  and i wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it  did you see it  

bingley replied that he did  and made his congratulations  elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes  how mr  darcy looked  therefore  she could
not tell 

 it is a delightful thing  to be sure  to have a daughter well married  
continued her mother   but at the same time  mr  bingley  it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me  they are gone down to
newcastle  a place quite northward  it seems  and there they are to stay
i do not know how long  his regiment is there  for i suppose you have
heard of his leaving the     shire  and of his being gone into the
regulars  thank heaven  he has  some  friends  though perhaps not so
many as he deserves  

elizabeth  who knew this to be levelled at mr  darcy  was in such
misery of shame  that she could hardly keep her seat  it drew from her 
however  the exertion of speaking  which nothing else had so effectually
done before  and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present  a few weeks  he believed 

 when you have killed all your own birds  mr  bingley   said her mother 
 i beg you will come here  and shoot as many as you please on mr 
bennet   manor  i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you  and
will save all the best of the covies for you  

elizabeth   misery increased  at such unnecessary  such officious
attention  were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago  every thing  she was persuaded  would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion  at that instant  she felt
that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion 

 the first wish of my heart   said she to herself   is never more to
be in company with either of them  their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this  let me never see either
one or the other again  

yet the misery  for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation  received soon afterwards material relief  from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her
former lover  when first he came in  he had spoken to her but little 
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention  he
found her as handsome as she had been last year  as good natured  and
as unaffected  though not quite so chatty  jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all  and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever  but her mind was so busily engaged 
that she did not always know when she was silent 

when the gentlemen rose to go away  mrs  bennet was mindful of her
intended civility  and they were invited and engaged to dine at
longbourn in a few days time 

 you are quite a visit in my debt  mr  bingley   she added   for when
you went to town last winter  you promised to take a family dinner with
us  as soon as you returned  i have not forgot  you see  and i assure
you  i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement  

bingley looked a little silly at this reflection  and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business  they then went away 

mrs  bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day  but  though she always kept a very good table  she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs  or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year 



chapter 54


as soon as they were gone  elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits 
or in other words  to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more  mr  darcy   behaviour astonished and vexed her 

 why  if he came only to be silent  grave  and indifferent   said she 
 did he come at all  

she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure 

 he could be still amiable  still pleasing  to my uncle and aunt  when
he was in town  and why not to me  if he fears me  why come hither  if
he no longer cares for me  why silent  teasing  teasing  man  i will
think no more about him  

her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister  who joined her with a cheerful look  which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors  than elizabeth 

 now   said she   that this first meeting is over  i feel perfectly
easy  i know my own strength  and i shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming  i am glad he dines here on tuesday  it will then be publicly
seen that  on both sides  we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance  

 yes  very indifferent indeed   said elizabeth  laughingly   oh  jane 
take care  

 my dear lizzy  you cannot think me so weak  as to be in danger now  

 i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever  

                                   

they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday  and mrs  bennet  in
the meanwhile  was giving way to all the happy schemes  which the good
humour and common politeness of bingley  in half an hour   visit  had
revived 

on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn  and the two
who were most anxiously expected  to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen  were in very good time  when they repaired to the
dining room  elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take
the place  which  in all their former parties  had belonged to him  by
her sister  her prudent mother  occupied by the same ideas  forbore
to invite him to sit by herself  on entering the room  he seemed to
hesitate  but jane happened to look round  and happened to smile  it was
decided  he placed himself by her 

elizabeth  with a triumphant sensation  looked towards his friend 
he bore it with noble indifference  and she would have imagined that
bingley had received his sanction to be happy  had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards mr  darcy  with an expression of half laughing
alarm 

his behaviour to her sister was such  during dinner time  as showed an
admiration of her  which  though more guarded than formerly  persuaded
elizabeth  that if left wholly to himself  jane   happiness  and his
own  would be speedily secured  though she dared not depend upon the
consequence  she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour  it
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast  for she was in
no cheerful humour  mr  darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them  he was on one side of her mother  she knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either  or make either appear to
advantage  she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse  but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other  and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did  her mother   ungraciousness 
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeth   mind 
and she would  at times  have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family 

she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together  that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance  anxious
and uneasy  the period which passed in the drawing room  before the
gentlemen came  was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil  she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend 

 if he does not come to me   then    said she   i shall give him up for
ever  

the gentlemen came  and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes  but  alas  the ladies had crowded round the table 
where miss bennet was making tea  and elizabeth pouring out the coffee 
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair  and on the gentlemen   approaching  one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever  and said  in a whisper 

 the men shan   come and part us  i am determined  we want none of them 
do we  

darcy had walked away to another part of the room  she followed him with
her eyes  envied everyone to whom he spoke  had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee  and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly 

 a man who has once been refused  how could i ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love  is there one among the sex  who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman 
there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings  

she was a little revived  however  by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself  and she seized the opportunity of saying 

 is your sister at pemberley still  

 yes  she will remain there till christmas  

 and quite alone  have all her friends left her  

 mrs  annesley is with her  the others have been gone on to scarborough 
these three weeks  

she could think of nothing more to say  but if he wished to converse
with her  he might have better success  he stood by her  however  for
some minutes  in silence  and  at last  on the young lady   whispering
to elizabeth again  he walked away 

when the tea things were removed  and the card tables placed  the ladies
all rose  and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him 
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother   rapacity for whist players  and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party  she now lost every expectation of pleasure 
they were confined for the evening at different tables  and she had
nothing to hope  but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room  as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself 

mrs  bennet had designed to keep the two netherfield gentlemen to
supper  but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others  and she had no opportunity of detaining them 

 well girls   said she  as soon as they were left to themselves   what
say you to the day  i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well 
i assure you  the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw  the
venison was roasted to a turn  and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch  the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
lucases  last week  and even mr  darcy acknowledged  that the partridges
were remarkably well done  and i suppose he has two or three french
cooks at least  and  my dear jane  i never saw you look in greater
beauty  mrs  long said so too  for i asked her whether you did not  and
what do you think she said besides   ah  mrs  bennet  we shall have her
at netherfield at last   she did indeed  i do think mrs  long is as good
a creature as ever lived  and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls 
and not at all handsome  i like them prodigiously  

mrs  bennet  in short  was in very great spirits  she had seen enough of
bingley   behaviour to jane  to be convinced that she would get him at
last  and her expectations of advantage to her family  when in a happy
humour  were so far beyond reason  that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day  to make his proposals 

 it has been a very agreeable day   said miss bennet to elizabeth   the
party seemed so well selected  so suitable one with the other  i hope we
may often meet again  

elizabeth smiled 

 lizzy  you must not do so  you must not suspect me  it mortifies me 
i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man  without having a wish beyond it  i am
perfectly satisfied  from what his manners now are  that he never had
any design of engaging my affection  it is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address  and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing  than any other man  

 you are very cruel   said her sister   you will not let me smile  and
are provoking me to it every moment  

 how hard it is in some cases to be believed  

 and how impossible in others  

 but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i
acknowledge  

 that is a question which i hardly know how to answer  we all love to
instruct  though we can teach only what is not worth knowing  forgive
me  and if you persist in indifference  do not make me your confidante  



chapter 55


a few days after this visit  mr  bingley called again  and alone  his
friend had left him that morning for london  but was to return home in
ten days time  he sat with them above an hour  and was in remarkably
good spirits  mrs  bennet invited him to dine with them  but  with many
expressions of concern  he confessed himself engaged elsewhere 

 next time you call   said she   i hope we shall be more lucky  

he should be particularly happy at any time  etc  etc   and if she would
give him leave  would take an early opportunity of waiting on them 

 can you come to morrow  

yes  he had no engagement at all for to morrow  and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity 

he came  and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed  in ran mrs  bennet to her daughter   room  in her dressing
gown  and with her hair half finished  crying out 

 my dear jane  make haste and hurry down  he is come  mr  bingley is
come  he is  indeed  make haste  make haste  here  sarah  come to miss
bennet this moment  and help her on with her gown  never mind miss
lizzy   hair  

 we will be down as soon as we can   said jane   but i dare say kitty is
forwarder than either of us  for she went up stairs half an hour ago  

 oh  hang kitty  what has she to do with it  come be quick  be quick 
where is your sash  my dear  

but when her mother was gone  jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters 

the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening  after tea  mr  bennet retired to the library  as was his
custom  and mary went up stairs to her instrument  two obstacles of
the five being thus removed  mrs  bennet sat looking and winking at
elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time  without making any
impression on them  elizabeth would not observe her  and when at last
kitty did  she very innocently said   what is the matter mamma  what do
you keep winking at me for  what am i to do  

 nothing child  nothing  i did not wink at you   she then sat still
five minutes longer  but unable to waste such a precious occasion  she
suddenly got up  and saying to kitty   come here  my love  i want to
speak to you   took her out of the room  jane instantly gave a look
at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation  and her
entreaty that  she  would not give in to it  in a few minutes  mrs 
bennet half opened the door and called out 

 lizzy  my dear  i want to speak with you  

elizabeth was forced to go 

 we may as well leave them by themselves you know   said her mother  as
soon as she was in the hall   kitty and i are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing room  

elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother  but remained
quietly in the hall  till she and kitty were out of sight  then returned
into the drawing room 

mrs  bennet   schemes for this day were ineffectual  bingley was every
thing that was charming  except the professed lover of her daughter  his
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party  and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the
mother  and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter 

he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper  and before he went
away  an engagement was formed  chiefly through his own and mrs 
bennet   means  for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband 

after this day  jane said no more of her indifference  not a word passed
between the sisters concerning bingley  but elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded  unless mr  darcy
returned within the stated time  seriously  however  she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman  
concurrence 

bingley was punctual to his appointment  and he and mr  bennet spent
the morning together  as had been agreed on  the latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected  there was nothing of presumption
or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule  or disgust him into
silence  and he was more communicative  and less eccentric  than the
other had ever seen him  bingley of course returned with him to dinner 
and in the evening mrs  bennet   invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter  elizabeth  who had a letter
to write  went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea 
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards  she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother   schemes 

but on returning to the drawing room  when her letter was finished  she
saw  to her infinite surprise  there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her  on opening the door  she perceived her
sister and bingley standing together over the hearth  as if engaged in
earnest conversation  and had this led to no suspicion  the faces of
both  as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other  would
have told it all  their situation was awkward enough  but  hers  she
thought was still worse  not a syllable was uttered by either  and
elizabeth was on the point of going away again  when bingley  who as
well as the other had sat down  suddenly rose  and whispering a few
words to her sister  ran out of the room 

jane could have no reserves from elizabeth  where confidence would give
pleasure  and instantly embracing her  acknowledged  with the liveliest
emotion  that she was the happiest creature in the world 

  tis too much   she added   by far too much  i do not deserve it  oh 
why is not everybody as happy  

elizabeth   congratulations were given with a sincerity  a warmth 
a delight  which words could but poorly express  every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane  but she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister  or say half that remained to be
said for the present 

 i must go instantly to my mother   she cried   i would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude  or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself  he is gone to my father already  oh  lizzy  to
know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family  how shall i bear so much happiness  

she then hastened away to her mother  who had purposely broken up the
card party  and was sitting up stairs with kitty 

elizabeth  who was left by herself  now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled  that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation 

 and this   said she   is the end of all his friend   anxious
circumspection  of all his sister   falsehood and contrivance  the
happiest  wisest  most reasonable end  

in a few minutes she was joined by bingley  whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose 

 where is your sister   said he hastily  as he opened the door 

 with my mother up stairs  she will be down in a moment  i dare say  

he then shut the door  and  coming up to her  claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister  elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship  they shook hands with
great cordiality  and then  till her sister came down  she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness  and of jane   perfections 
and in spite of his being a lover  elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded  because they had for
basis the excellent understanding  and super excellent disposition of
jane  and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself 

it was an evening of no common delight to them all  the satisfaction of
miss bennet   mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face  as
made her look handsomer than ever  kitty simpered and smiled  and hoped
her turn was coming soon  mrs  bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings 
though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour  and when
mr  bennet joined them at supper  his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was 

not a word  however  passed his lips in allusion to it  till their
visitor took his leave for the night  but as soon as he was gone  he
turned to his daughter  and said 

 jane  i congratulate you  you will be a very happy woman  

jane went to him instantly  kissed him  and thanked him for his
goodness 

 you are a good girl   he replied   and i have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled  i have not a doubt of your
doing very well together  your tempers are by no means unlike  you are
each of you so complying  that nothing will ever be resolved on  so
easy  that every servant will cheat you  and so generous  that you will
always exceed your income  

 i hope not so  imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me  

 exceed their income  my dear mr  bennet   cried his wife   what are you
talking of  why  he has four or five thousand a year  and very likely
more   then addressing her daughter   oh  my dear  dear jane  i am so
happy  i am sure i shan   get a wink of sleep all night  i knew how it
would be  i always said it must be so  at last  i was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing  i remember  as soon as ever i saw him  when
he first came into hertfordshire last year  i thought how likely it was
that you should come together  oh  he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen  

wickham  lydia  were all forgotten  jane was beyond competition her
favourite child  at that moment  she cared for no other  her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense 

mary petitioned for the use of the library at netherfield  and kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter 

bingley  from this time  was of course a daily visitor at longbourn 
coming frequently before breakfast  and always remaining till after
supper  unless when some barbarous neighbour  who could not be enough
detested  had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept 

elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister  for
while he was present  jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else 
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur  in the absence of jane  he
always attached himself to elizabeth  for the pleasure of talking of
her  and when bingley was gone  jane constantly sought the same means of
relief 

 he has made me so happy   said she  one evening   by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring  i had not believed
it possible  

 i suspected as much   replied elizabeth   but how did he account for
it  

 it must have been his sister   doing  they were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me  which i cannot wonder at  since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects  but when they see 
as i trust they will  that their brother is happy with me  they will
learn to be contented  and we shall be on good terms again  though we
can never be what we once were to each other  

 that is the most unforgiving speech   said elizabeth   that i ever
heard you utter  good girl  it would vex me  indeed  to see you again
the dupe of miss bingley   pretended regard  

 would you believe it  lizzy  that when he went to town last november 
he really loved me  and nothing but a persuasion of  my  being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again  

 he made a little mistake to be sure  but it is to the credit of his
modesty  

this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence  and
the little value he put on his own good qualities  elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend  for 
though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world  she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him 

 i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed   cried
jane   oh  lizzy  why am i thus singled from my family  and blessed
above them all  if i could but see  you  as happy  if there  were  but
such another man for you  

 if you were to give me forty such men  i never could be so happy as
you  till i have your disposition  your goodness  i never can have your
happiness  no  no  let me shift for myself  and  perhaps  if i have very
good luck  i may meet with another mr  collins in time  

the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a
secret  mrs  bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs  phillips 
and she ventured  without any permission  to do the same by all her
neighbours in meryton 

the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world  though only a few weeks before  when lydia had first run away 
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune 



chapter 56


one morning  about a week after bingley   engagement with jane had been
formed  as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining room  their attention was suddenly drawn to the window  by the
sound of a carriage  and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn  it was too early in the morning for visitors  and besides  the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours  the horses
were post  and neither the carriage  nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it  were familiar to them  as it was certain  however  that
somebody was coming  bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion  and walk away with him into the
shrubbery  they both set off  and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued  though with little satisfaction  till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered  it was lady catherine de bourgh 

they were of course all intending to be surprised  but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation  and on the part of mrs 
bennet and kitty  though she was perfectly unknown to them  even
inferior to what elizabeth felt 

she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious  made no
other reply to elizabeth   salutation than a slight inclination of the
head  and sat down without saying a word  elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship   entrance  though no request of
introduction had been made 

mrs  bennet  all amazement  though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance  received her with the utmost politeness  after sitting
for a moment in silence  she said very stiffly to elizabeth 

 i hope you are well  miss bennet  that lady  i suppose  is your
mother  

elizabeth replied very concisely that she was 

 and  that  i suppose is one of your sisters  

 yes  madam   said mrs  bennet  delighted to speak to lady catherine 
 she is my youngest girl but one  my youngest of all is lately married 
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds  walking with a young man
who  i believe  will soon become a part of the family  

 you have a very small park here   returned lady catherine after a short
silence 

 it is nothing in comparison of rosings  my lady  i dare say  but i
assure you it is much larger than sir william lucas    

 this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening  in
summer  the windows are full west  

mrs  bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner  and then
added 

 may i take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left mr  and
mrs  collins well  

 yes  very well  i saw them the night before last  

elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
charlotte  as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling  but no
letter appeared  and she was completely puzzled 

mrs  bennet  with great civility  begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment  but lady catherine very resolutely  and not very politely 
declined eating anything  and then  rising up  said to elizabeth 

 miss bennet  there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn  i should be glad to take a turn in it  if you
will favour me with your company  

 go  my dear   cried her mother   and show her ladyship about the
different walks  i think she will be pleased with the hermitage  

elizabeth obeyed  and running into her own room for her parasol 
attended her noble guest downstairs  as they passed through the
hall  lady catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and
drawing room  and pronouncing them  after a short survey  to be decent
looking rooms  walked on 

her carriage remained at the door  and elizabeth saw that her
waiting woman was in it  they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse  elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable 

 how could i ever think her like her nephew   said she  as she looked in
her face 

as soon as they entered the copse  lady catherine began in the following
manner   

 you can be at no loss  miss bennet  to understand the reason of my
journey hither  your own heart  your own conscience  must tell you why i
come  

elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment 

 indeed  you are mistaken  madam  i have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here  

 miss bennet   replied her ladyship  in an angry tone   you ought to
know  that i am not to be trifled with  but however insincere  you  may
choose to be  you shall not find  me  so  my character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness  and in a cause of such
moment as this  i shall certainly not depart from it  a report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago  i was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married  but that
you  that miss elizabeth bennet  would  in all likelihood  be soon
afterwards united to my nephew  my own nephew  mr  darcy  though i
 know  it must be a scandalous falsehood  though i would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible  i instantly resolved
on setting off for this place  that i might make my sentiments known to
you  

 if you believed it impossible to be true   said elizabeth  colouring
with astonishment and disdain   i wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far  what could your ladyship propose by it  

 at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted  

 your coming to longbourn  to see me and my family   said elizabeth
coolly   will be rather a confirmation of it  if  indeed  such a report
is in existence  

 if  do you then pretend to be ignorant of it  has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves  do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad  

 i never heard that it was  

 and can you likewise declare  that there is no foundation for it  

 i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship  you may
ask questions which i shall not choose to answer  

 this is not to be borne  miss bennet  i insist on being satisfied  has
he  has my nephew  made you an offer of marriage  

 your ladyship has declared it to be impossible  

 it ought to be so  it must be so  while he retains the use of his
reason  but your arts and allurements may  in a moment of infatuation 
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family  you
may have drawn him in  

 if i have  i shall be the last person to confess it  

 miss bennet  do you know who i am  i have not been accustomed to such
language as this  i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world 
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns  

 but you are not entitled to know mine  nor will such behaviour as this 
ever induce me to be explicit  

 let me be rightly understood  this match  to which you have the
presumption to aspire  can never take place  no  never  mr  darcy is
engaged to my daughter  now what have you to say  

 only this  that if he is so  you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me  

lady catherine hesitated for a moment  and then replied 

 the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind  from their infancy 
they have been intended for each other  it was the favourite wish of
 his  mother  as well as of hers  while in their cradles  we planned
the union  and now  at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage  to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth  of no importance in the world  and wholly unallied to
the family  do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends  to his
tacit engagement with miss de bourgh  are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy  have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin  

 yes  and i had heard it before  but what is that to me  if there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew  i shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry miss de bourgh  you both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage  its completion depended on others  if mr  darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin  why is not he to make
another choice  and if i am that choice  why may not i accept him  

 because honour  decorum  prudence  nay  interest  forbid it  yes 
miss bennet  interest  for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends  if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all  you will
be censured  slighted  and despised  by everyone connected with him 
your alliance will be a disgrace  your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us  

 these are heavy misfortunes   replied elizabeth   but the wife of mr 
darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation  that she could  upon the whole  have no cause
to repine  

 obstinate  headstrong girl  i am ashamed of you  is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring  is nothing due to me on that
score  let us sit down  you are to understand  miss bennet  that i came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose  nor will
i be dissuaded from it  i have not been used to submit to any person  
whims  i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment  

  that  will make your ladyship   situation at present more pitiable 
but it will have no effect on me  

 i will not be interrupted  hear me in silence  my daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other  they are descended  on the maternal
side  from the same noble line  and  on the father    from respectable 
honourable  and ancient  though untitled  families  their fortune on
both sides is splendid  they are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses  and what is to divide them 
the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family  connections 
or fortune  is this to be endured  but it must not  shall not be  if you
were sensible of your own good  you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up  

 in marrying your nephew  i should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere  he is a gentleman  i am a gentleman   daughter  so far we are
equal  

 true  you  are  a gentleman   daughter  but who was your mother 
who are your uncles and aunts  do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition  

 whatever my connections may be   said elizabeth   if your nephew does
not object to them  they can be nothing to  you   

 tell me once for all  are you engaged to him  

though elizabeth would not  for the mere purpose of obliging lady
catherine  have answered this question  she could not but say  after a
moment   deliberation 

 i am not  

lady catherine seemed pleased 

 and will you promise me  never to enter into such an engagement  

 i will make no promise of the kind  

 miss bennet i am shocked and astonished  i expected to find a more
reasonable young woman  but do not deceive yourself into a belief that
i will ever recede  i shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance i require  

 and i certainly  never  shall give it  i am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable  your ladyship wants mr  darcy to marry
your daughter  but would my giving you the wished for promise make their
marriage at all more probable  supposing him to be attached to me  would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin 
allow me to say  lady catherine  that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill judged  you have widely mistaken my character  if
you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these  how far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs  i cannot tell 
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine  i must beg 
therefore  to be importuned no farther on the subject  

 not so hasty  if you please  i have by no means done  to all the
objections i have already urged  i have still another to add  i am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister   infamous
elopement  i know it all  that the young man   marrying her was a
patched up business  at the expence of your father and uncles  and is
such a girl to be my nephew   sister  is her husband  is the son of his
late father   steward  to be his brother  heaven and earth   of what are
you thinking  are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted  

 you can now have nothing further to say   she resentfully answered 
 you have insulted me in every possible method  i must beg to return to
the house  

and she rose as she spoke  lady catherine rose also  and they turned
back  her ladyship was highly incensed 

 you have no regard  then  for the honour and credit of my nephew 
unfeeling  selfish girl  do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody  

 lady catherine  i have nothing further to say  you know my sentiments  

 you are then resolved to have him  

 i have said no such thing  i am only resolved to act in that manner 
which will  in my own opinion  constitute my happiness  without
reference to  you   or to any person so wholly unconnected with me  

 it is well  you refuse  then  to oblige me  you refuse to obey the
claims of duty  honour  and gratitude  you are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends  and make him the contempt of the world  

 neither duty  nor honour  nor gratitude   replied elizabeth   have any
possible claim on me  in the present instance  no principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with mr  darcy  and with regard to the
resentment of his family  or the indignation of the world  if the former
 were  excited by his marrying me  it would not give me one moment  
concern  and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn  

 and this is your real opinion  this is your final resolve  very well 
i shall now know how to act  do not imagine  miss bennet  that your
ambition will ever be gratified  i came to try you  i hoped to find you
reasonable  but  depend upon it  i will carry my point  

in this manner lady catherine talked on  till they were at the door of
the carriage  when  turning hastily round  she added   i take no leave
of you  miss bennet  i send no compliments to your mother  you deserve
no such attention  i am most seriously displeased  

elizabeth made no answer  and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house  walked quietly into it herself  she
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs  her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room  to ask why lady
catherine would not come in again and rest herself 

 she did not choose it   said her daughter   she would go  

 she is a very fine looking woman  and her calling here was prodigiously
civil  for she only came  i suppose  to tell us the collinses were
well  she is on her road somewhere  i dare say  and so  passing through
meryton  thought she might as well call on you  i suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you  lizzy  

elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here  for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible 



chapter 57


the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
elizabeth into  could not be easily overcome  nor could she  for many
hours  learn to think of it less than incessantly  lady catherine  it
appeared  had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings 
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr 
darcy  it was a rational scheme  to be sure  but from what the report
of their engagement could originate  elizabeth was at a loss to imagine 
till she recollected that  his  being the intimate friend of bingley 
and  her  being the sister of jane  was enough  at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another  to supply
the idea  she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together  and her neighbours
at lucas lodge  therefore  for through their communication with the
collinses  the report  she concluded  had reached lady catherine   had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate  which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time 

in revolving lady catherine   expressions  however  she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference  from what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage  it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew  and how  he  might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her  she dared
not pronounce  she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt  or his dependence on her judgment  but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than  she  could do  and it
was certain that  in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with  one  
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own  his aunt would
address him on his weakest side  with his notions of dignity  he would
probably feel that the arguments  which to elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous  contained much good sense and solid reasoning 

if he had been wavering before as to what he should do  which had often
seemed likely  the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt  and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him  in that case he would return no more  lady
catherine might see him in her way through town  and his engagement to
bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way 

 if  therefore  an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days   she added   i shall know how to understand
it  i shall then give over every expectation  every wish of his
constancy  if he is satisfied with only regretting me  when he might
have obtained my affections and hand  i shall soon cease to regret him
at all  

                                   

the surprise of the rest of the family  on hearing who their visitor had
been  was very great  but they obligingly satisfied it  with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased mrs  bennet   curiosity  and
elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject 

the next morning  as she was going downstairs  she was met by her
father  who came out of his library with a letter in his hand 

 lizzy   said he   i was going to look for you  come into my room  

she followed him thither  and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held  it suddenly struck her that it
might be from lady catherine  and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations 

she followed her father to the fire place  and they both sat down  he
then said 

 i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly  as it principally concerns yourself  you ought to know its
contents  i did not know before  that i had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony  let me congratulate you on a very important conquest  

the colour now rushed into elizabeth   cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew  instead of the aunt 
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all  or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself  when her father continued 

 you look conscious  young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these  but i think i may defy even  your  sagacity  to discover the
name of your admirer  this letter is from mr  collins  

 from mr  collins  and what can  he  have to say  

 something very much to the purpose of course  he begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter  of
which  it seems  he has been told by some of the good natured  gossiping
lucases  i shall not sport with your impatience  by reading what he says
on that point  what relates to yourself  is as follows   having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs  collins and myself on
this happy event  let me now add a short hint on the subject of another 
of which we have been advertised by the same authority  your daughter
elizabeth  it is presumed  will not long bear the name of bennet  after
her elder sister has resigned it  and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land  

 can you possibly guess  lizzy  who is meant by this    this young
gentleman is blessed  in a peculiar way  with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire   splendid property  noble kindred  and extensive
patronage  yet in spite of all these temptations  let me warn my cousin
elizabeth  and yourself  of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman   proposals  which  of course  you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of  

 have you any idea  lizzy  who this gentleman is  but now it comes out 

  my motive for cautioning you is as follows  we have reason to imagine
that his aunt  lady catherine de bourgh  does not look on the match with
a friendly eye  

  mr  darcy   you see  is the man  now  lizzy  i think i  have 
surprised you  could he  or the lucases  have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance  whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related  mr  darcy  who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish  and who probably never looked at you in his
life  it is admirable  

elizabeth tried to join in her father   pleasantry  but could only force
one most reluctant smile  never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her 

 are you not diverted  

 oh  yes  pray read on  

  after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night  she immediately  with her usual condescension  expressed what she
felt on the occasion  when it became apparent  that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin  she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match  i thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin  that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about  and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned   mr 
collins moreover adds   i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydia   sad
business has been so well hushed up  and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known  i must not  however  neglect the duties of my station  or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married  it was an
encouragement of vice  and had i been the rector of longbourn  i should
very strenuously have opposed it  you ought certainly to forgive them 
as a christian  but never to admit them in your sight  or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing   that is his notion of christian
forgiveness  the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlotte  
situation  and his expectation of a young olive branch  but  lizzy  you
look as if you did not enjoy it  you are not going to be  missish  
i hope  and pretend to be affronted at an idle report  for what do we
live  but to make sport for our neighbours  and laugh at them in our
turn  

 oh   cried elizabeth   i am excessively diverted  but it is so
strange  

 yes   that  is what makes it amusing  had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing  but  his  perfect indifference  and  your 
pointed dislike  make it so delightfully absurd  much as i abominate
writing  i would not give up mr  collins   correspondence for any
consideration  nay  when i read a letter of his  i cannot help giving
him the preference even over wickham  much as i value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son in law  and pray  lizzy  what said lady catherine
about this report  did she call to refuse her consent  

to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh  and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion  she was not distressed by
his repeating it  elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not  it was necessary to laugh  when she
would rather have cried  her father had most cruelly mortified her  by
what he said of mr  darcy   indifference  and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration  or fear that perhaps  instead of
his seeing too little  she might have fancied too much 



chapter 58


instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend  as
elizabeth half expected mr  bingley to do  he was able to bring darcy
with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherine  
visit  the gentlemen arrived early  and  before mrs  bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt  of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread  bingley  who wanted to be alone with jane  proposed
their all walking out  it was agreed to  mrs  bennet was not in the
habit of walking  mary could never spare time  but the remaining five
set off together  bingley and jane  however  soon allowed the others
to outstrip them  they lagged behind  while elizabeth  kitty  and darcy
were to entertain each other  very little was said by either  kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk  elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution  and perhaps he might be doing the same 

they walked towards the lucases  because kitty wished to call upon
maria  and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern 
when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone  now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed  and  while her courage was
high  she immediately said 

 mr  darcy  i am a very selfish creature  and  for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings  care not how much i may be wounding yours  i
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister  ever since i have known it  i have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it  were it known to the rest
of my family  i should not have merely my own gratitude to express  

 i am sorry  exceedingly sorry   replied darcy  in a tone of surprise
and emotion   that you have ever been informed of what may  in a
mistaken light  have given you uneasiness  i did not think mrs  gardiner
was so little to be trusted  

 you must not blame my aunt  lydia   thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter  and  of course  i could
not rest till i knew the particulars  let me thank you again and again 
in the name of all my family  for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble  and bear so many mortifications  for the
sake of discovering them  

 if you  will  thank me   he replied   let it be for yourself alone 
that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on  i shall not attempt to deny  but your
 family  owe me nothing  much as i respect them  i believe i thought
only of  you   

elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word  after a short pause 
her companion added   you are too generous to trifle with me  if your
feelings are still what they were last april  tell me so at once   my 
affections and wishes are unchanged  but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever  

elizabeth  feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation  now forced herself to speak  and immediately  though not
very fluently  gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change  since the period to which he alluded  as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances  the
happiness which this reply produced  was such as he had probably never
felt before  and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do  had elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye  she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight  diffused over his face  became him 
but  though she could not look  she could listen  and he told her of
feelings  which  in proving of what importance she was to him  made his
affection every moment more valuable 

they walked on  without knowing in what direction  there was too much to
be thought  and felt  and said  for attention to any other objects  she
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt  who did call on him in her return through
london  and there relate her journey to longbourn  its motive  and the
substance of her conversation with elizabeth  dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which  in her ladyship   apprehension 
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance  in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give  but  unluckily for her
ladyship  its effect had been exactly contrariwise 

 it taught me to hope   said he   as i had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before  i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that 
had you been absolutely  irrevocably decided against me  you would have
acknowledged it to lady catherine  frankly and openly  

elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied   yes  you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of  that   after abusing you so
abominably to your face  i could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations  

 what did you say of me  that i did not deserve  for  though your
accusations were ill founded  formed on mistaken premises  my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof  it was
unpardonable  i cannot think of it without abhorrence  

 we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening   said elizabeth   the conduct of neither  if strictly examined 
will be irreproachable  but since then  we have both  i hope  improved
in civility  

 i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself  the recollection of what i
then said  of my conduct  my manners  my expressions during the whole of
it  is now  and has been many months  inexpressibly painful to me  your
reproof  so well applied  i shall never forget   had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner   those were your words  you know not  you can
scarcely conceive  how they have tortured me   though it was some time 
i confess  before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice  

 i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression  i had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way  

 i can easily believe it  you thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling  i am sure you did  the turn of your countenance i shall never
forget  as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me  

 oh  do not repeat what i then said  these recollections will not do at
all  i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it  

darcy mentioned his letter   did it   said he   did it soon make you
think better of me  did you  on reading it  give any credit to its
contents  

she explained what its effect on her had been  and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed 

 i knew   said he   that what i wrote must give you pain  but it was
necessary  i hope you have destroyed the letter  there was one part
especially  the opening of it  which i should dread your having the
power of reading again  i can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me  

 the letter shall certainly be burnt  if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard  but  though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable  they are not  i hope  quite so easily
changed as that implies  

 when i wrote that letter   replied darcy   i believed myself perfectly
calm and cool  but i am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit  

 the letter  perhaps  began in bitterness  but it did not end so  the
adieu is charity itself  but think no more of the letter  the feelings
of the person who wrote  and the person who received it  are now
so widely different from what they were then  that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten  you must learn some
of my philosophy  think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure  

 i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind  your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach  that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy  but  what is much better  of
innocence  but with me  it is not so  painful recollections will intrude
which cannot  which ought not  to be repelled  i have been a selfish
being all my life  in practice  though not in principle  as a child i
was taught what was right  but i was not taught to correct my temper  i
was given good principles  but left to follow them in pride and conceit 
unfortunately an only son  for many years an only child   i was spoilt
by my parents  who  though good themselves  my father  particularly  all
that was benevolent and amiable   allowed  encouraged  almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing  to care for none beyond my own family
circle  to think meanly of all the rest of the world  to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own  such i
was  from eight to eight and twenty  and such i might still have been
but for you  dearest  loveliest elizabeth  what do i not owe you  you
taught me a lesson  hard indeed at first  but most advantageous  by you 
i was properly humbled  i came to you without a doubt of my reception 
you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased  

 had you then persuaded yourself that i should  

 indeed i had  what will you think of my vanity  i believed you to be
wishing  expecting my addresses  

 my manners must have been in fault  but not intentionally  i assure
you  i never meant to deceive you  but my spirits might often lead me
wrong  how you must have hated me after  that  evening  

 hate you  i was angry perhaps at first  but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction  

 i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me  when we met at
pemberley  you blamed me for coming  

 no indeed  i felt nothing but surprise  

 your surprise could not be greater than  mine  in being noticed by you 
my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness  and i
confess that i did not expect to receive  more  than my due  

 my object then   replied darcy   was to show you  by every civility in
my power  that i was not so mean as to resent the past  and i hoped to
obtain your forgiveness  to lessen your ill opinion  by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to  how soon any other wishes
introduced themselves i can hardly tell  but i believe in about half an
hour after i had seen you  

he then told her of georgiana   delight in her acquaintance  and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption  which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption  she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn  and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend 

she expressed her gratitude again  but it was too painful a subject to
each  to be dwelt on farther 

after walking several miles in a leisurely manner  and too busy to know
anything about it  they found at last  on examining their watches  that
it was time to be at home 

 what could become of mr  bingley and jane   was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs  darcy was delighted with
their engagement  his friend had given him the earliest information of
it 

 i must ask whether you were surprised   said elizabeth 

 not at all  when i went away  i felt that it would soon happen  

 that is to say  you had given your permission  i guessed as much   and
though he exclaimed at the term  she found that it had been pretty much
the case 

 on the evening before my going to london   said he   i made a
confession to him  which i believe i ought to have made long ago  i
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent  his surprise was great  he had never had
the slightest suspicion  i told him  moreover  that i believed myself
mistaken in supposing  as i had done  that your sister was indifferent
to him  and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated  i felt no doubt of their happiness together  

elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend 

 did you speak from your own observation   said she   when you told him
that my sister loved him  or merely from my information last spring  

 from the former  i had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which i had lately made here  and i was convinced of her affection  

 and your assurance of it  i suppose  carried immediate conviction to
him  

 it did  bingley is most unaffectedly modest  his diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case  but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy  i was obliged to confess
one thing  which for a time  and not unjustly  offended him  i could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter  that i had known it  and purposely kept it from him  he was
angry  but his anger  i am persuaded  lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister   sentiments  he has heartily forgiven me
now  

elizabeth longed to observe that mr  bingley had been a most delightful
friend  so easily guided that his worth was invaluable  but she checked
herself  she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at 
and it was rather too early to begin  in anticipating the happiness
of bingley  which of course was to be inferior only to his own  he
continued the conversation till they reached the house  in the hall they
parted 



chapter 59


 my dear lizzy  where can you have been walking to   was a question
which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room 
and from all the others when they sat down to table  she had only to
say in reply  that they had wandered about  till she was beyond her own
knowledge  she coloured as she spoke  but neither that  nor anything
else  awakened a suspicion of the truth 

the evening passed quietly  unmarked by anything extraordinary  the
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed  the unacknowledged were silent 
darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth 
and elizabeth  agitated and confused  rather  knew  that she was happy
than  felt  herself to be so  for  besides the immediate embarrassment 
there were other evils before her  she anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known  she was aware that no
one liked him but jane  and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away 

at night she opened her heart to jane  though suspicion was very far
from miss bennet   general habits  she was absolutely incredulous here 

 you are joking  lizzy  this cannot be   engaged to mr  darcy  no  no 
you shall not deceive me  i know it to be impossible  

 this is a wretched beginning indeed  my sole dependence was on you  and
i am sure nobody else will believe me  if you do not  yet  indeed  i am
in earnest  i speak nothing but the truth  he still loves me  and we are
engaged  

jane looked at her doubtingly   oh  lizzy  it cannot be  i know how much
you dislike him  

 you know nothing of the matter   that  is all to be forgot  perhaps i
did not always love him so well as i do now  but in such cases as
these  a good memory is unpardonable  this is the last time i shall ever
remember it myself  

miss bennet still looked all amazement  elizabeth again  and more
seriously assured her of its truth 

 good heaven  can it be really so  yet now i must believe you   cried
jane   my dear  dear lizzy  i would  i do congratulate you  but are you
certain  forgive the question  are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him  

 there can be no doubt of that  it is settled between us already  that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world  but are you pleased 
jane  shall you like to have such a brother  

 very  very much  nothing could give either bingley or myself more
delight  but we considered it  we talked of it as impossible  and do you
really love him quite well enough  oh  lizzy  do anything rather than
marry without affection  are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do  

 oh  yes  you will only think i feel  more  than i ought to do  when i
tell you all  

 what do you mean  

 why  i must confess that i love him better than i do bingley  i am
afraid you will be angry  

 my dearest sister  now  be  serious  i want to talk very seriously  let
me know every thing that i am to know  without delay  will you tell me
how long you have loved him  

 it has been coming on so gradually  that i hardly know when it began 
but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at pemberley  

another entreaty that she would be serious  however  produced the
desired effect  and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment  when convinced on that article  miss bennet had nothing
further to wish 

 now i am quite happy   said she   for you will be as happy as myself 
i always had a value for him  were it for nothing but his love of you 
i must always have esteemed him  but now  as bingley   friend and your
husband  there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me  but
lizzy  you have been very sly  very reserved with me  how little did you
tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton  i owe all that i know
of it to another  not to you  

elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy  she had been unwilling
to mention bingley  and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend  but now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in lydia   marriage  all was acknowledged 
and half the night spent in conversation 

                                   

 good gracious   cried mrs  bennet  as she stood at a window the next
morning   if that disagreeable mr  darcy is not coming here again with
our dear bingley  what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here  i had no notion but he would go a shooting  or something or
other  and not disturb us with his company  what shall we do with him 
lizzy  you must walk out with him again  that he may not be in bingley  
way  

elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal  yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet 

as soon as they entered  bingley looked at her so expressively  and
shook hands with such warmth  as left no doubt of his good information 
and he soon afterwards said aloud   mrs  bennet  have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again to day  

 i advise mr  darcy  and lizzy  and kitty   said mrs  bennet   to walk
to oakham mount this morning  it is a nice long walk  and mr  darcy has
never seen the view  

 it may do very well for the others   replied mr  bingley   but i am
sure it will be too much for kitty  won   it  kitty   kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home  darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the mount  and elizabeth silently consented  as she went
up stairs to get ready  mrs  bennet followed her  saying 

 i am quite sorry  lizzy  that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself  but i hope you will not mind it  it is
all for jane   sake  you know  and there is no occasion for talking
to him  except just now and then  so  do not put yourself to
inconvenience  

during their walk  it was resolved that mr  bennet   consent should be
asked in the course of the evening  elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother    she could not determine how her mother
would take it  sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man  but whether she
were violently set against the match  or violently delighted with it  it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense  and she could no more bear that mr  darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy  than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation 

                                   

in the evening  soon after mr  bennet withdrew to the library  she saw
mr  darcy rise also and follow him  and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme  she did not fear her father   opposition  but he was going to
be made unhappy  and that it should be through her means  that  she  
his favourite child  should be distressing him by her choice  should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her  was a wretched
reflection  and she sat in misery till mr  darcy appeared again  when 
looking at him  she was a little relieved by his smile  in a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty  and  while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper   go to your father  he
wants you in the library   she was gone directly 

her father was walking about the room  looking grave and anxious 
 lizzy   said he   what are you doing  are you out of your senses  to be
accepting this man  have not you always hated him  

how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable  her expressions more moderate  it would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give 
but they were now necessary  and she assured him  with some confusion 
of her attachment to mr  darcy 

 or  in other words  you are determined to have him  he is rich  to be
sure  and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane 
but will they make you happy  

 have you any other objection   said elizabeth   than your belief of my
indifference  

 none at all  we all know him to be a proud  unpleasant sort of man  but
this would be nothing if you really liked him  

 i do  i do like him   she replied  with tears in her eyes   i love him 
indeed he has no improper pride  he is perfectly amiable  you do not
know what he really is  then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms  

 lizzy   said her father   i have given him my consent  he is the kind
of man  indeed  to whom i should never dare refuse anything  which he
condescended to ask  i now give it to  you   if you are resolved on
having him  but let me advise you to think better of it  i know
your disposition  lizzy  i know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable  unless you truly esteemed your husband  unless you looked
up to him as a superior  your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage  you could scarcely escape
discredit and misery  my child  let me not have the grief of seeing
 you  unable to respect your partner in life  you know not what you are
about  

elizabeth  still more affected  was earnest and solemn in her reply  and
at length  by repeated assurances that mr  darcy was really the object
of her choice  by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone  relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day  but had stood the test of many months 
suspense  and enumerating with energy all his good qualities  she did
conquer her father   incredulity  and reconcile him to the match 

 well  my dear   said he  when she ceased speaking   i have no more to
say  if this be the case  he deserves you  i could not have parted with
you  my lizzy  to anyone less worthy  

to complete the favourable impression  she then told him what mr  darcy
had voluntarily done for lydia  he heard her with astonishment 

 this is an evening of wonders  indeed  and so  darcy did every thing 
made up the match  gave the money  paid the fellow   debts  and got him
his commission  so much the better  it will save me a world of trouble
and economy  had it been your uncle   doing  i must and  would  have
paid him  but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way  i shall offer to pay him to morrow  he will rant and storm about
his love for you  and there will be an end of the matter  

he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before  on his reading
mr  collins   letter  and after laughing at her some time  allowed her
at last to go  saying  as she quitted the room   if any young men come
for mary or kitty  send them in  for i am quite at leisure  

elizabeth   mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight  and  after
half an hour   quiet reflection in her own room  she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure  every thing was too recent for
gaiety  but the evening passed tranquilly away  there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded  and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time 

when her mother went up to her dressing room at night  she followed her 
and made the important communication  its effect was most extraordinary 
for on first hearing it  mrs  bennet sat quite still  and unable to
utter a syllable  nor was it under many  many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard  though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family  or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them  she began at length to recover  to fidget about in
her chair  get up  sit down again  wonder  and bless herself 

 good gracious  lord bless me  only think  dear me  mr  darcy  who would
have thought it  and is it really true  oh  my sweetest lizzy  how rich
and how great you will be  what pin money  what jewels  what carriages
you will have  jane   is nothing to it  nothing at all  i am so
pleased  so happy  such a charming man   so handsome  so tall   oh  my
dear lizzy  pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before  i
hope he will overlook it  dear  dear lizzy  a house in town  every thing
that is charming  three daughters married  ten thousand a year  oh 
lord  what will become of me  i shall go distracted  

this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted  and
elizabeth  rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself 
soon went away  but before she had been three minutes in her own room 
her mother followed her 

 my dearest child   she cried   i can think of nothing else  ten
thousand a year  and very likely more   tis as good as a lord  and a
special licence  you must and shall be married by a special licence  but
my dearest love  tell me what dish mr  darcy is particularly fond of 
that i may have it to morrow  

this was a sad omen of what her mother   behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be  and elizabeth found that  though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection  and secure of her relations 
consent  there was still something to be wished for  but the morrow
passed off much better than she expected  for mrs  bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to
him  unless it was in her power to offer him any attention  or mark her
deference for his opinion 

elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him  and mr  bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem 

 i admire all my three sons in law highly   said he   wickham  perhaps 
is my favourite  but i think i shall like  your  husband quite as well
as jane    



chapter 60


elizabeth   spirits soon rising to playfulness again  she wanted mr 
darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her   how could
you begin   said she   i can comprehend your going on charmingly  when
you had once made a beginning  but what could set you off in the first
place  

 i cannot fix on the hour  or the spot  or the look  or the words  which
laid the foundation  it is too long ago  i was in the middle before i
knew that i  had  begun  

 my beauty you had early withstood  and as for my manners  my behaviour
to  you  was at least always bordering on the uncivil  and i never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not  now be sincere 
did you admire me for my impertinence  

 for the liveliness of your mind  i did  

 you may as well call it impertinence at once  it was very little less 
the fact is  that you were sick of civility  of deference  of officious
attention  you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking 
and looking  and thinking for  your  approbation alone  i roused  and
interested you  because i was so unlike  them   had you not been really
amiable  you would have hated me for it  but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself  your feelings were always noble and just  and
in your heart  you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you  there  i have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it  and really  all things considered  i begin to think it perfectly
reasonable  to be sure  you knew no actual good of me  but nobody thinks
of  that  when they fall in love  

 was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was
ill at netherfield  

 dearest jane  who could have done less for her  but make a virtue of it
by all means  my good qualities are under your protection  and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible  and  in return  it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be  and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last  what made you so shy of me  when you first
called  and afterwards dined here  why  especially  when you called  did
you look as if you did not care about me  

 because you were grave and silent  and gave me no encouragement  

 but i was embarrassed  

 and so was i  

 you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner  

 a man who had felt less  might  

 how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give  and that
i should be so reasonable as to admit it  but i wonder how long you
 would  have gone on  if you had been left to yourself  i wonder when
you  would  have spoken  if i had not asked you  my resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect 
 too much   i am afraid  for what becomes of the moral  if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise  for i ought not to have mentioned the
subject  this will never do  

 you need not distress yourself  the moral will be perfectly fair  lady
catherine   unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts  i am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude  i was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours  my aunt   intelligence had given me
hope  and i was determined at once to know every thing  

 lady catherine has been of infinite use  which ought to make her happy 
for she loves to be of use  but tell me  what did you come down to
netherfield for  was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed 
or had you intended any more serious consequence  

 my real purpose was to see  you   and to judge  if i could  whether i
might ever hope to make you love me  my avowed one  or what i avowed to
myself  was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley 
and if she were  to make the confession to him which i have since made  

 shall you ever have courage to announce to lady catherine what is to
befall her  

 i am more likely to want more time than courage  elizabeth  but it
ought to be done  and if you will give me a sheet of paper  it shall be
done directly  

 and if i had not a letter to write myself  i might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing  as another young lady once did  but
i have an aunt  too  who must not be longer neglected  

from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr  darcy
had been over rated  elizabeth had never yet answered mrs  gardiner  
long letter  but now  having  that  to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome  she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness  and immediately wrote as
follows 

 i would have thanked you before  my dear aunt  as i ought to have done 
for your long  kind  satisfactory  detail of particulars  but to say the
truth  i was too cross to write  you supposed more than really existed 
but  now  suppose as much as you choose  give a loose rein to your
fancy  indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford  and unless you believe me actually married  you
cannot greatly err  you must write again very soon  and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last  i thank you  again and again 
for not going to the lakes  how could i be so silly as to wish it  your
idea of the ponies is delightful  we will go round the park every day  i
am the happiest creature in the world  perhaps other people have said so
before  but not one with such justice  i am happier even than jane  she
only smiles  i laugh  mr  darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me  you are all to come to pemberley at christmas 
yours  etc  

mr  darcy   letter to lady catherine was in a different style  and still
different from either was what mr  bennet sent to mr  collins  in reply
to his last 

 dear sir 

 i must trouble you once more for congratulations  elizabeth will soon
be the wife of mr  darcy  console lady catherine as well as you can 
but  if i were you  i would stand by the nephew  he has more to give 

 yours sincerely  etc  

miss bingley   congratulations to her brother  on his approaching
marriage  were all that was affectionate and insincere  she wrote even
to jane on the occasion  to express her delight  and repeat all her
former professions of regard  jane was not deceived  but she was
affected  and though feeling no reliance on her  could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved 

the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information 
was as sincere as her brother   in sending it  four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight  and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister 

before any answer could arrive from mr  collins  or any congratulations
to elizabeth from his wife  the longbourn family heard that the
collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge  the reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident  lady catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew   letter  that
charlotte  really rejoicing in the match  was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over  at such a moment  the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth  though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought  when she
saw mr  darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband  he bore it  however  with admirable calmness  he could even
listen to sir william lucas  when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country  and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at st  james    with very decent composure  if he did
shrug his shoulders  it was not till sir william was out of sight 

mrs  phillips   vulgarity was another  and perhaps a greater  tax on his
forbearance  and though mrs  phillips  as well as her sister  stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingley   good
humour encouraged  yet  whenever she  did  speak  she must be vulgar 
nor was her respect for him  though it made her more quiet  at all
likely to make her more elegant  elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either  and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself  and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification  and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure  it
added to the hope of the future  and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either  to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
pemberley 



chapter 61


happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs  bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters  with what delighted pride
she afterwards visited mrs  bingley  and talked of mrs  darcy  may
be guessed  i wish i could say  for the sake of her family  that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible 
amiable  well informed woman for the rest of her life  though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband  who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form  that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly 

mr  bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly  his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do  he delighted in
going to pemberley  especially when he was least expected 

mr  bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth  so near
a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to
 his  easy temper  or  her  affectionate heart  the darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified  he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to derbyshire  and jane and elizabeth  in addition to every other source
of happiness  were within thirty miles of each other 

kitty  to her very material advantage  spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters  in society so superior to what she had generally
known  her improvement was great  she was not of so ungovernable a
temper as lydia  and  removed from the influence of lydia   example 
she became  by proper attention and management  less irritable  less
ignorant  and less insipid  from the further disadvantage of lydia  
society she was of course carefully kept  and though mrs  wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her  with the promise of
balls and young men  her father would never consent to her going 

mary was the only daughter who remained at home  and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs  bennet   being quite
unable to sit alone  mary was obliged to mix more with the world  but
she could still moralize over every morning visit  and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters  beauty and her own 
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance 

as for wickham and lydia  their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters  he bore with philosophy the conviction that
elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her  and in spite of every
thing  was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune  the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received
from lydia on her marriage  explained to her that  by his wife at least 
if not by himself  such a hope was cherished  the letter was to this
effect 

 my dear lizzy 

 i wish you joy  if you love mr  darcy half as well as i do my dear
wickham  you must be very happy  it is a great comfort to have you so
rich  and when you have nothing else to do  i hope you will think of us 
i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much  and i do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help 
any place would do  of about three or four hundred a year  but however 
do not speak to mr  darcy about it  if you had rather not 

 yours  etc  

as it happened that elizabeth had  much  rather not  she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind 
such relief  however  as it was in her power to afford  by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences  she
frequently sent them  it had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs  under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants  and heedless of the future  must be very insufficient to
their support  and whenever they changed their quarters  either jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills  their manner of living  even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home  was unsettled in the
extreme  they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation  and always spending more than they ought  his affection for
her soon sunk into indifference  hers lasted a little longer  and
in spite of her youth and her manners  she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her 

though darcy could never receive  him  at pemberley  yet  for
elizabeth   sake  he assisted him further in his profession  lydia was
occasionally a visitor there  when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in london or bath  and with the bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long  that even bingley   good humour was overcome  and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone 

miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcy   marriage  but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley  she
dropt all her resentment  was fonder than ever of georgiana  almost as
attentive to darcy as heretofore  and paid off every arrear of civility
to elizabeth 

pemberley was now georgiana   home  and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what darcy had hoped to see  they were able to love each
other even as well as they intended  georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of elizabeth  though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively  sportive  manner of
talking to her brother  he  who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection  she now saw the object of open
pleasantry  her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way  by elizabeth   instructions  she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself 

lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew 
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement  she sent him
language so very abusive  especially of elizabeth  that for some time
all intercourse was at an end  but at length  by elizabeth   persuasion 
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence  and seek a reconciliation 
and  after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt  her
resentment gave way  either to her affection for him  or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself  and she condescended to wait
on them at pemberley  in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received  not merely from the presence of such a mistress  but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city 

with the gardiners  they were always on the most intimate terms 
darcy  as well as elizabeth  really loved them  and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who  by bringing
her into derbyshire  had been the means of uniting them
