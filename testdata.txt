chapter 1


sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who
for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage
there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a
distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and
respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents
there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs
changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over
the almost endless creations of the last century and there
if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history
with an interest which never failed  this was the page at which
the favorite volume always opened

		     elliot of kellynch hall
walter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabeth
daughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county of
gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabeth
born june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still born son
november 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791

precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands
but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of
himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth  
married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles
musgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somerset
and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which
he had lost his wife

then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family
in the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshire
how mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriff
representing a borough in three successive parliaments
exertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first year
of charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had married
forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding with
the arms and motto  principal seat kellynch hall in the county
of somerset and sir walter s handwriting again in this finale  

heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson of
the second sir walter

vanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot s character
vanity of person and of situation  he had been remarkably handsome
in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man 
few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did
nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with
the place he held in society  he considered the blessing of beauty
as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliot
who united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respect
and devotion 

his good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment
since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character
to any thing deserved by his own  lady elliot had been an excellent woman
sensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliot
had never required indulgence afterwards  she had humoured
or softened or concealed his failings and promoted his real
respectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiest
being in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friends
and her children to attach her to life and make it no matter of
indifference to her when she was called on to quit them 
  three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy
for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to
the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father 
she had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving woman
who had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settle
close by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advice
lady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of
the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously
giving her daughters

this friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance  thirteen years
had passed away since lady elliot s death and they were still
near neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widower
the other a widow

that lady russell of steady age and character and extremely
well provided for should have no thought of a second marriage
needs no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again than when she does not
but sir walter s continuing in singleness requires explanation 
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with
one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications
prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake 
for one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thing
which he had not been very much tempted to do  elizabeth had succeeded
at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother s rights
and consequence and being very handsome and very like himself
her influence had always been great and they had gone on together
most happily  his two other children were of very inferior value 
mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming
mrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness
of character which must have placed her high with any people
of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister
her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way  
she was only anne

to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued
god daughter favourite and friend  lady russell loved them all
but it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again

a few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girl
but her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height
her father had found little to admire in her so totally different
were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own
there could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thin
to excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now none
of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work 
all equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merely
connected herself with an old country family of respectability and
large fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received none 
elizabeth would one day or other marry suitably

it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than
she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any
charm is lost  it was so with elizabeth still the same handsome
miss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir walter
might be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at least
be deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabeth
as blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else
for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and
acquaintance were growing  anne haggard mary coarse every face
in the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow s foot
about lady russell s temples had long been a distress to him

elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment
thirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding and
directing with a self possession and decision which could never have given
the idea of her being younger than she was  for thirteen years had
she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home
and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after
lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country 
thirteen winters revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball
of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springs
shewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her father
for a few weeks annual enjoyment of the great world  she had
the remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of being
nine and twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions
she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever
but she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoiced
to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet blood within
the next twelvemonth or two  then might she again take up
the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth
but now she liked it not  always to be presented with the date of
her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister
made the book an evil and more than once when her father had left it
open on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyes
and pushed it away

she had had a disappointment moreover which that book
and especially the history of her own family must ever present
the remembrance of  the heir presumptive the very william walter
elliot esq whose rights had been so generously supported
by her father had disappointed her

she had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to be
in the event of her having no brother the future baronet
meant to marry him and her father had always meant that she should 
he had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot s death
sir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtures
had not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking it
making allowance for the modest drawing back of youth and in one of
their spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloom
mr elliot had been forced into the introduction

he was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the law
and elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favour
was confirmed  he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of
and expected all the rest of the year but he never came 
the following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeable
again encouraged invited and expected and again he did not come
and the next tidings were that he was married  instead of pushing
his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliot
he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman
of inferior birth

sir walter has resented it  as the head of the house he felt that
he ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young man
so publicly by the hand for they must have been seen together
he observed once at tattersal s and twice in the lobby of
the house of commons  his disapprobation was expressed
but apparently very little regarded  mr elliot had attempted no apology
and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family
as sir walter considered him unworthy of it  all acquaintance between
them had ceased

this very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an interval
of several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the man
for himself and still more for being her father s heir and whose
strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walter
elliot s eldest daughter  there was not a baronet from a to z whom
her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal 
yet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she was
at this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbons
for his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again 
the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was
no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over
had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention
of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully
of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood
he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own 
this could not be pardoned

such were elizabeth elliot s sentiments and sensations such the cares
to alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegance
the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life
such the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residence
in one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habits
of utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupy

but now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these  her father was growing distressed for money 
she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive
the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of
mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts  the kellynch property was good
but not equal to sir walter s apprehension of the state required
in its possessor  while lady elliot lived there had been method
moderation and economy which had just kept him within his income
but with her had died all such right mindedness and from that period
he had been constantly exceeding it  it had not been possible
for him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliot
was imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he was
not only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so often
that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partially
from his daughter  he had given her some hints of it the last spring
in town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrench 
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which
we can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the first
ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done
and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off
some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing
the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added
the happy thought of their taking no present down to anne
as had been the usual yearly custom  but these measures
however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent
of the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obliged
to confess to her soon afterwards  elizabeth had nothing to propose
of deeper efficacy  she felt herself ill used and unfortunate
as did her father and they were neither of them able to devise
any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity
or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne

there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of
but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference 
he had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power
but he would never condescend to sell  no he would never disgrace
his name so far  the kellynch estate should be transmitted whole
and entire as he had received it

their two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived in
the neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise them
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments
and reduce their expenditure without involving the loss of
any indulgence of taste or pride



chapter 2


mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his hold
or his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeable
prompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hint
and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to
the excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sense
he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as
he meant to see finally adopted

lady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave it
much serious consideration  she was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decision
in this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principles 
she was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honour
but she was as desirous of saving sir walter s feelings as solicitous
for the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of what
was due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well be 
she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of
strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions
of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding 
she had a cultivated mind and was generally speaking
rational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry
she had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a little
to the faults of those who possessed them  herself the widow of
only a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due
and sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintance
an attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of her
very dear friend the father of anne and her sisters was
as being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great deal
of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties

they must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  but she was
very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him
and elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations
and she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted anne
who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest
in the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by her
in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted
to sir walter every emendation of anne s had been on the side of
honesty against importance  she wanted more vigorous measures
a more complete reformation a quicker release from debt
a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity

if we can persuade your father to all this said lady russell
looking over her paper much may be done  if he will adopt
these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope
we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has
a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions
and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from
lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle 
what will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first families
have done or ought to do  there will be nothing singular in his case
and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering
as it always does of our conduct  i have great hope of prevailing 
we must be serious and decided for after all the person who
has contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due to
the feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your father
there is still more due to the character of an honest man

this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding
his friends to be urging him  she considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with
all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments
could secure and saw no dignity in anything short of it 
she wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  she rated
lady russell s influence highly and as to the severe degree
of self denial which her own conscience prompted she believed
there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete
than to half a reformation  her knowledge of her father
and elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair
of horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so on
through the whole list of lady russell s too gentle reductions

how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken
is of little consequence  lady russell s had no success at all
could not be put up with were not to be borne what every comfort
of life knocked off  journeys london servants horses table  
contractions and restrictions every where  to live no longer
with the decencies even of a private gentleman  no he would sooner
quit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful terms

quit kellynch hall  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherd
whose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter s retrenching
and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without
a change of abode  since the idea had been started in the very quarter
which ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessing
his judgement to be entirely on that side  it did not appear to him
that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house
which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support 
in any other place sir walter might judge for himself and would
be looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever way
he might choose to model his household 

sir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days more
of doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should go
was settled and the first outline of this important change made out

there had been three alternatives london bath or another house
in the country  all anne s wishes had been for the latter 
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have
lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure
of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object
of her ambition  but the usual fate of anne attended her
in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on 
she disliked bath and did not think it agreed with her
and bath was to be her home

sir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd felt
that he could not be trusted in london and had been skillful enough
to dissuade him from it and make bath preferred  it was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be important
at comparatively little expense  two material advantages of bath
over london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenient
distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending
some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction
of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been
for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that
they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there

lady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne s known wishes 
it would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small house
in his own neighbourhood  anne herself would have found
the mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter s
feelings they must have been dreadful  and with regard to anne s
dislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising
first from the circumstance of her having been three years
at school there after her mother s death and secondly
from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter
which she had afterwards spent there with herself

lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think
it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health
by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge
every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must
do both health and spirits good  anne had been too little from home
too little seen her spirits were not high  a larger society
would improve them  she wanted her to be more known

the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood
for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part
and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily
engrafted on the beginning  he was not only to quit his home
but to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitude
which stronger heads than sir walter s have found too much 
kellynch hall was to be let  this however was a profound secret
not to be breathed beyond their own circle

sir walter could not have borne the degradation of being known
to design letting his house  mr shepherd had once mentioned the word
advertise but never dared approach it again  sir walter spurned
the idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his having such an intention and it was only on
the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favour
that he would let it at all

how quick come the reasons for approving what we like  lady russell had
another excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walter
and his family were to remove from the country  elizabeth had been
lately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interrupted 
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned
after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with
the additional burden of two children  she was a clever young woman
who understood the art of pleasing  the art of pleasing at least
at kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliot
as to have been already staying there more than once in spite of all
that lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of place
could hint of caution and reserve

lady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabeth
and seemed to love her rather because she would love her
than because elizabeth deserved it  she had never received from her more
than outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisance
had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry
against previous inclination  she had been repeatedly very earnest
in trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly open
to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements
which shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured
to give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience
but always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way and never had she
pursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than in
this selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deserving
a sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought
to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility

from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal
and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion
and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice
of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore
an object of first rate importance



chapter 3


i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherd
one morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaper
that the present juncture is much in our favour  this peace will
be turning all our rich naval officers ashore  they will be
all wanting a home  could not be a better time sir walter
for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants 
many a noble fortune has been made during the war  if a rich admiral
were to come in our way sir walter  

he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walter
that s all i have to remark  a prize indeed would kellynch hall
be to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have taken
ever so many before hey shepherd

mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added  

i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of business
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  i have had a little knowledge
of their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that they
have very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenants
as any set of people one should meet with  therefore sir walter
what i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence of
any rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplated
as a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keep
the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice
and curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherd
might conceal any family matters that i chose for nobody would think it
worth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon him
which it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus much
i venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me if
with all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroad
in the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applications
will unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthy
naval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to add
that two hours will bring me over at any time to save you
the trouble of replying

sir walter only nodded  but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room
he observed sarcastically  

there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description

they would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortune
said mrs clay for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her over
nothing being of so much use to mrs clay s health as a drive to kellynch 
but i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be
a very desirable tenant  i have known a good deal of the profession
and besides their liberality they are so neat and careful
in all their ways  these valuable pictures of yours sir walter
if you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  everything in
and about the house would be taken such excellent care of 
the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order
as they are now  you need not be afraid miss elliot of your own
sweet flower gardens being neglected

as to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were induced
to let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges
to be annexed to it  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant 
the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers
or men of any other description can have had such a range
but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds
is another thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being
always approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guard
with respect to her flower garden  i am very little disposed
to grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favour
i assure you be he sailor or soldier

after a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say  

in all these cases there are established usages which
make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant 
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands  depend upon me
for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights 
i venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealous
for his own as john shepherd will be for him

here anne spoke  

the navy i think who have done so much for us have at least
an equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts and
all the privileges which any home can give  sailors work hard enough
for their comforts we must all allow

very true very true  what miss anne says is very true
was mr shepherd s rejoinder and oh certainly was his daughter s
but sir walter s remark was soon afterwards  

the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to see
any friend of mine belonging to it

indeed was the reply and with a look of surprise

yes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong grounds
of objection to it  first as being the means of bringing persons
of obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honours
which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondly
as it cuts up a man s youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows old
sooner than any other man  i have observed it all my life 
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise
of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to
and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in
any other line  one day last spring in town i was in company
with two men striking instances of what i am talking of
lord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curate
without bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ives
and a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable looking personage
you can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and rugged
to the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a side
and nothing but a dab of powder at top  in the name of heaven
who is that old fellow said i to a friend of mine who was standing near
sir basil morley  old fellow cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin 
what do you take his age to be  sixty said i or perhaps sixty two 
forty replied sir basil forty and no more  picture to yourselves
my amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwin 
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do
but to a degree i know it is the same with them all  they are all
knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather
till they are not fit to be seen  it is a pity they are not knocked
on the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin s age

nay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeed 
have a little mercy on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsome 
the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes
i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  but then
is not it the same with many other professions perhaps most other 
soldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even in
the quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mind
if not of the body which seldom leaves a man s looks to the natural
effect of time  the lawyer plods quite care worn the physician
is up at all hours and travelling in all weather and even
the clergyman   she stopt a moment to consider what might
do for the clergyman  and even the clergyman you know is obliged
to go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks to
all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  in fact as i have
long been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourable
in its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any
who can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hours
following their own pursuits and living on their own property
without the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i say
to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost 
i know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness
when they cease to be quite young

it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak
sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant
had been gifted with foresight for the very first application
for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards
fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed
he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent 
by the report which he hastened over to kellynch to make
admiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquired
a very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own country
and had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised places
in that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited him
that accidentally hearing  it was just as he had foretold
mr shepherd observed sir walter s concerns could not be kept a secret  
accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to let
and understanding his mr shepherd s connection with the owner
he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries
and had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strong
an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description
could feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himself
every proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenant

and who is admiral croft was sir walter s cold suspicious inquiry

mr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman s family
and mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followed
added  

he is a rear admiral of the white  he was in the trafalgar action
and has been in the east indies since he was stationed there
i believe several years

then i take it for granted observed sir walter that his face
is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery

mr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very hale
hearty well looking man a little weather beaten to be sure
but not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour
not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanted
a comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possible
knew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready furnished
house of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprised
if sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manor
would be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of it
said he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentleman

mr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out all
the circumstances of the admiral s family which made him
peculiarly desirable as a tenant  he was a married man
and without children the very state to be wished for  a house was
never taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a lady 
he did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering
as much where there was no lady as where there were many children 
a lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniture
in the world  he had seen mrs croft too she was at taunton
with the admiral and had been present almost all the time they were
talking the matter over

and a very well spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to be
continued he asked more questions about the house and terms
and taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversant
with business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quite
unconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to say
she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once
she told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who lived
a few years back at monkford  bless me what was his name 
at this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so lately 
penelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentleman
who lived at monkford  mrs croft s brother

but mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did not
hear the appeal

i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember
no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent

bless me how very odd  i shall forget my own name soon i suppose 
a name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentleman
so well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me once
i remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer s man
breaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolen
caught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgement
submitted to an amicable compromise  very odd indeed

after waiting another moment  

you mean mr wentworth i suppose said anne

mr shepherd was all gratitude 

wentworth was the very name  mr wentworth was the very man 
he had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time back
for two or three years  came there about the year    5 i take it 
you remember him i am sure

wentworth  oh ay  mr wentworth the curate of monkford 
you misled me by the term gentleman  i thought you were speaking of
some man of property  mr wentworth was nobody i remember
quite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford family 
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common

as mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did them
no service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returning
with all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably
in their favour their age and number and fortune the high idea
they had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude for
the advantage of renting it making it appear as if they ranked
nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliot 
an extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed in
the secret of sir walter s estimate of the dues of a tenant

it succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look with
an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms
he was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treaty
and authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remained
at taunton and fix a day for the house being seen

sir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enough
of the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenant
in all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offer 
so far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a little
additional soothing in the admiral s situation in life which was just
high enough and not too high  i have let my house to admiral croft
would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr  
a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs
a note of explanation  an admiral speaks his own consequence
and at the same time can never make a baronet look small 
in all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must ever
have the precedence

nothing could be done without a reference to elizabeth 
but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal
that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand
and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her

mr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner had
such an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listener
to the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for her
flushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove said
with a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhaps
may be walking here



chapter 4


he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkford
however suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworth
his brother who being made commander in consequence of the action
off st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshire
in the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a home
for half a year at monkford  he was at that time a remarkably fine
young man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancy
and anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty taste
and feeling  half the sum of attraction on either side might have
been enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to love
but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail 
they were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly and
deeply in love  it would be difficult to say which had seen
highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest 
she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in
having them accepted

a short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short one
troubles soon arose  sir walter on being applied to without actually
withholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it all
the negative of great astonishment great coldness great silence
and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter 
he thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though with
more tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate one

anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind
to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen
in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself
to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances
of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure
even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away
which she grieved to think of  anne elliot so young known to so few
to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune
or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxious
youth killing dependence  it must not be if by any fair interference
of friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother s love
and mother s rights it would be prevented

captain wentworth had no fortune  he had been lucky in his profession
but spending freely what had come freely had realized nothing 
but he was confident that he should soon be rich  full of life and ardour
he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station
that would lead to everything he wanted  he had always been lucky
he knew he knew he should be so still  such confidence powerful
in its own warmth and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it
must have been enough for anne but lady russell saw it very differently 
his sanguine temper and fearlessness of mind operated very differently
on her  she saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  it only added
a dangerous character to himself  he was brilliant he was headstrong 
lady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approaching to
imprudence a horror  she deprecated the connexion in every light

such opposition as these feelings produced was more than
anne could combat  young and gentle as she was it might yet
have been possible to withstand her father s ill will
though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister
but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not
with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner
be continually advising her in vain  she was persuaded to believe
the engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capable
of success and not deserving it  but it was not a merely selfish caution
under which she acted in putting an end to it  had she not
imagined herself consulting his good even more than her own
she could hardly have given him up  the belief of being prudent
and self denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolation
under the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolation
was required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions
on his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himself
ill used by so forced a relinquishment  he had left the country
in consequence

a few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance
but not with a few months ended anne s share of suffering from it 
her attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded every
enjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spirits
had been their lasting effect

more than seven years were gone since this little history
of sorrowful interest had reached its close and time had
softened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him
but she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been given
in change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the rupture
or in any novelty or enlargement of society  no one had ever
come within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison with
frederick wentworth as he stood in her memory  no second attachment
the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure
at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind
the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society
around them  she had been solicited when about two and twenty
to change her name by the young man who not long afterwards found
a more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell had
lamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a man
whose landed property and general importance were second in that country
only to sir walter s and of good character and appearance
and however lady russell might have asked yet for something more
while anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty two
so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of
her father s house and settled so permanently near herself 
but in this case anne had left nothing for advice to do
and though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretion
never wished the past undone she began now to have the anxiety
which borders on hopelessness for anne s being tempted by some man
of talents and independence to enter a state for which she held her
to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits

they knew not each other s opinion either its constancy or its change
on the one leading point of anne s conduct for the subject was never
alluded to but anne at seven and twenty thought very differently
from what she had been made to think at nineteen  she did not blame
lady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by her
but she felt that were any young person in similar circumstances
to apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of such
certain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future good 
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home
and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears
delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman
in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it
and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs
without reference to the actual results of their case which
as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than
could be reasonably calculated on  all his sanguine expectations
all his confidence had been justified  his genius and ardour
had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path 
he had very soon after their engagement ceased got employ 
and all that he had told her would follow had taken place 
he had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rank
and must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortune 
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority
but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy
she had no reason to believe him married

how eloquent could anne elliot have been how eloquent at least
were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerful
confidence in futurity against that over anxious caution which
seems to insult exertion and distrust providence  she had been forced
into prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew older 
the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning

with all these circumstances recollections and feelings
she could not hear that captain wentworth s sister was likely
to live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a stroll
and many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea 
she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves
sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts
and their business no evil  she was assisted however by that
perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only three
of her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to deny
any recollection of it  she could do justice to the superiority
of lady russell s motives in this over those of her father and elizabeth
she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness
but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important
from whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft s really
taking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction which
had always been most grateful to her of the past being known to
those three only among her connexions by whom no syllable
she believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among his
the brother only with whom he had been residing had received
any information of their short lived engagement  that brother had been
long removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreover
a single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature s
having heard of it from him

the sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanying
her husband on a foreign station and her own sister mary
had been at school while it all occurred and never admitted by
the pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledge
of it afterwards

with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch
and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated
need not involve any particular awkwardness



chapter 5


on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft s seeing kellynch hall
anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell s
and keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most natural
to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them

this meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory
and decided the whole business at once  each lady was previously
well disposed for an agreement and saw nothing therefore
but good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlemen
there was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberality
on the admiral s side as could not but influence sir walter
who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished
behaviour by mr shepherd s assurances of his being known by report
to the admiral as a model of good breeding

the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts
were approved terms time every thing and every body was right
and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been
a single preliminary difference to modify of all that
this indenture sheweth

sir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to be
the best looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to say
that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair
he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where
and the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wife
as they drove back through the park i thought we should soon
come to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at taunton 
the baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to be
no harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have been
esteemed about equal

the crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walter
proposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding month
there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement

lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use
or any importance in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon
and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might
convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements
of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks
she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne
though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare
of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad
of the autumnal months in the country did not think that
everything considered she wished to remain  it would be most right
and most wise and therefore must involve least suffering
to go with the others

something occurred however to give her a different duty 
mary often a little unwell and always thinking a great deal
of her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming anne
when anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeing
that she should not have a day s health all the autumn entreated
or rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come to
uppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want her
instead of going to bath

i cannot possibly do without anne was mary s reasoning
and elizabeth s reply was then i am sure anne had better stay
for nobody will want her in bath

to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to
be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty
and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country
and her own dear country readily agreed to stay

this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties
and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath
till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time
should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge

so far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startled
by the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on her
which was mrs clay s being engaged to go to bath with sir walter
and elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter
in all the business before her  lady russell was extremely sorry
that such a measure should have been resorted to at all wondered
grieved and feared and the affront it contained to anne
in mrs clay s being of so much use while anne could be of none
was a very sore aggravation

anne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she felt
the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russell 
with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge
which she often wished less of her father s character she was
sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy
were more than possible  she did not imagine that her father
had at present an idea of the kind  mrs clay had freckles
and a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continually
making severe remarks upon in her absence but she was young
and certainly altogether well looking and possessed in an acute mind
and assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractions
than any merely personal might have been  anne was so impressed
by the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herself
from trying to make it perceptible to her sister  she had little hope
of success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would be
so much more to be pitied than herself should never she thought
have reason to reproach her for giving no warning

she spoke and seemed only to offend  elizabeth could not conceive
how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantly
answered for each party s perfectly knowing their situation

mrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she is
and as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be
i can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they are
particularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of condition
and rank more strongly than most people  and as to my father
i really should not have thought that he who has kept himself single
so long for our sakes need be suspected now  if mrs clay were
a very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have her
so much with me not that anything in the world i am sure
would induce my father to make a degrading match but he might
be rendered unhappy  but poor mrs clay who with all her merits
can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor
mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety  one would imagine
you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes
though i know you must fifty times  that tooth of her s
and those freckles  freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do him  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a few
but he abominates them  you must have heard him notice
mrs clay s freckles

there is hardly any personal defect replied anne
which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to

i think very differently answered elizabeth shortly
an agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can never
alter plain ones  however at any rate as i have a great deal more
at stake on this point than anybody else can have i think it
rather unnecessary in you to be advising me

anne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopeless
of doing good  elizabeth though resenting the suspicion
might yet be made observant by it

the last office of the four carriage horses was to draw sir walter
miss elliot and mrs clay to bath  the party drove off
in very good spirits  sir walter prepared with condescending bows
for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint
to show themselves and anne walked up at the same time
in a sort of desolate tranquility to the lodge where she was to spend
the first week

her friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt this
break up of the family exceedingly  their respectability was
as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become
precious by habit  it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds
and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into
and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village
and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived
she had determined to make her own absence from home begin
when she must give up anne  accordingly their removal was made together
and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage
of lady russell s journey

uppercross was a moderate sized village which a few years back
had been completely in the old english style containing only
two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers
the mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old trees
substantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonage
enclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear tree
trained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young squire
it had received the improvement of a farm house elevated into a cottage
for his residence and uppercross cottage with its veranda
french windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catch
the traveller s eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect
and premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther on

here anne had often been staying  she knew the ways of uppercross
as well as those of kellynch  the two families were so continually meeting
so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house
at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone
but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course  though better endowed than the elder sister
mary had not anne s understanding nor temper  while well and happy
and properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spirits
but any indisposition sunk her completely  she had no resources
for solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliot
self importance was very prone to add to every other distress
that of fancying herself neglected and ill used  in person she was
inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached
the dignity of being a fine girl  she was now lying on the faded sofa
of the pretty little drawing room the once elegant furniture of which
had been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summers
and two children and on anne s appearing greeted her with  

so you are come at last  i began to think i should never see you 
i am so ill i can hardly speak  i have not seen a creature
the whole morning

i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne  you sent me
such a good account of yourself on thursday

yes i made the best of it i always do  but i was very far from well
at the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my life
as i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone i am sure 
suppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way
and not able to ring the bell  so lady russell would not get out 
i do not think she has been in this house three times this summer

anne said what was proper and enquired after her husband 
oh charles is out shooting  i have not seen him since seven o clock 
he would go though i told him how ill i was  he said he should not
stay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost one 
i assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morning

you have had your little boys with you

yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good  little charles does not mind
a word i say and walter is growing quite as bad

well you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfully 
you know i always cure you when i come  how are your neighbours
at the great house

i can give you no account of them  i have not seen one of them to day
except mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the window
but without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i was
not one of them have been near me  it did not happen to suit
the miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselves
out of their way

you will see them yet perhaps before the morning is gone 
it is early

i never want them i assure you  they talk and laugh a great deal
too much for me  oh anne i am so very unwell  it was quite unkind
of you not to come on thursday

my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself 
you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly well
and in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be aware
that my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the last 
and besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busy
have had so much to do that i could not very conveniently have
left kellynch sooner

dear me what can you possibly have to do

a great many things i assure you  more than i can recollect
in a moment but i can tell you some  i have been making
a duplicate of the catalogue of my father s books and pictures 
i have been several times in the garden with mackenzie
trying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth s plants
are for lady russell  i have had all my own little concerns
to arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repack
from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons 
and one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying nature 
going to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take leave 
i was told that they wished it  but all these things took up
a great deal of time

oh well and after a moment s pause but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the pooles yesterday

did you go then  i have made no enquiries because i concluded
you must have been obliged to give up the party

oh yes i went  i was very well yesterday nothing at all
the matter with me till this morning  it would have been strange
if i had not gone

i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party

nothing remarkable  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will be
and who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not having
a carriage of one s own  mr and mrs musgrove took me and we were
so crowded  they are both so very large and take up so much room
and mr musgrove always sits forward  so there was i crowded into
the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely
that my illness to day may be owing to it

a little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness
on anne s side produced nearly a cure on mary s  she could soon
sit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be able
to leave it by dinner time  then forgetting to think of it
she was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegay
then she ate her cold meat and then she was well enough
to propose a little walk

where shall we go said she when they were ready  i suppose
you will not like to call at the great house before they have
been to see you

i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne 
i should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i know
so well as mrs and the miss musgroves

oh but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible 
they ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  however
we may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when we
have that over we can enjoy our walk

anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent
but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence
neither family could now do without it  to the great house accordingly
they went to sit the full half hour in the old fashioned square parlour
with a small carpet and shining floor to which the present
daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion
by a grand piano forte and a harp flower stands and little tables
placed in every direction  oh could the originals of the portraits
against the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet and
the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been conscious
of such an overthrow of all order and neatness  the portraits themselves
seemed to be staring in astonishment

the musgroves like their houses were in a state of alteration
perhaps of improvement  the father and mother were in the old
english style and the young people in the new  mr and mrs musgrove
were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable
not much educated and not at all elegant  their children had
more modern minds and manners  there was a numerous family
but the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisa
young ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeter
all the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousands
of other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merry 
their dress had every advantage their faces were rather pretty
their spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasant
they were of consequence at home and favourites abroad 
anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures
of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some
comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility
of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant
and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing
but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together
that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known
so little herself with either of her sisters

they were received with great cordiality  nothing seemed amiss
on the side of the great house family which was generally
as anne very well knew the least to blame  the half hour was
chatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprised
at the end of it to have their walking party joined by both
the miss musgroves at mary s particular invitation



chapter 6


anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles
will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea 
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it
or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage
in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs
which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity
and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed
she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing
our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her
for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject
which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks
she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found
in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove 
so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath
do you think they will settle in and this without much
waiting for an answer or in the young ladies addition of
i hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papa
if we do go we must be in a good situation  none of your
queen squares for us or in the anxious supplement from mary of  
upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone away
to be happy at bath

she could only resolve to avoid such self delusion in future
and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing
of having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russell

the mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroy
their own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the females
were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping
neighbours dress dancing and music  she acknowledged it to be
very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate
its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become
a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into 
with the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercross
it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memory
and all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possible

she had no dread of these two months  mary was not so repulsive
and unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers
neither was there anything among the other component parts
of the cottage inimical to comfort  she was always on friendly terms
with her brother in law and in the children who loved her nearly as well
and respected her a great deal more than their mother she had
an object of interest amusement and wholesome exertion

charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was
undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation
or grace to make the past as they were connected together
at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time
anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match
might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding
might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness
rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  as it was
he did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwise
trifled away without benefit from books or anything else 
he had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by
his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness
sometimes to anne s admiration and upon the whole though there was
very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share
than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass
for a happy couple  they were always perfectly agreed in the want
of more money and a strong inclination for a handsome present
from his father but here as on most topics he had the superiority
for while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not made
he always contended for his father s having many other uses for his money
and a right to spend it as he liked

as to the management of their children his theory was much better
than his wife s and his practice not so bad  i could manage them
very well if it were not for mary s interference was what
anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in
but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of charles spoils
the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had
the smallest temptation to say very true

one of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there
was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties
and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house 
known to have some influence with her sister she was continually requested
or at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicable 
i wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself ill
was charles s language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke mary 
i do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not think
there was anything the matter with me  i am sure anne if you would
you might persuade him that i really am very ill  a great deal worse
than i ever own

mary s declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house
though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours
and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash
and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with anne to say oh miss anne i cannot help wishing
mrs charles had a little of your method with those children 
they are quite different creatures with you  but to be sure
in general they are so spoilt  it is a pity you cannot put your sister
in the way of managing them  they are as fine healthy children
as ever were seen poor little dears without partiality
but mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated   
bless me how troublesome they are sometimes  i assure you miss anne
it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as
i otherwise should  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleased
with my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very bad
to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment don t do this and don t do that  or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them

she had this communication moreover from mary  mrs musgrove thinks
all her servants so steady that it would be high treason
to call it in question but i am sure without exaggeration
that her upper house maid and laundry maid instead of being
in their business are gadding about the village all day long 
i meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nursery
without seeing something of them  if jemima were not the trustiest
steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her
for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them 
and on mrs musgrove s side it was i make a rule of never interfering
in any of my daughter in law s concerns for i know it would not do
but i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set things
to rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles s nursery maid 
i hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from
my own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine dressing lady
that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near 
mrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hint
that you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amiss
you need not be afraid of mentioning it

again it was mary s complaint that mrs musgrove was very apt
not to give her the precedence that was her due when they dined
at the great house with other families and she did not see any reason
why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place 
and one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of them
after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said
i have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are
about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent
you are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint that
it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious
especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take
place of mamma  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma
but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it 
it is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world
but i know it is taken notice of by many persons

how was anne to set all these matters to rights  she could do little more
than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each
to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary
between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest
which were meant for her sister s benefit

in all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well 
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject
by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened
by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse
with the other family since there was neither superior affection
confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it
was rather an advantage  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possible
for they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunder
but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight
of mr and mrs musgrove s respectable forms in the usual places
or without the talking laughing and singing of their daughters

she played a great deal better than either of the miss musgroves
but having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parents
to sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance was
little thought of only out of civility or to refresh the others
as she was well aware  she knew that when she played she was
giving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensation 
excepting one short period of her life she had never since the age
of fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother know the happiness
of being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste 
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world
and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters
performance and total indifference to any other person s
gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification
for her own

the party at the great house was sometimes increased by other company 
the neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visited
by everybody and had more dinner parties and more callers
more visitors by invitation and by chance than any other family 
there were more completely popular

the girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionally
in an unpremeditated little ball  there was a family of cousins
within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances
who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would come
at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne
very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post
played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which
always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove
more than anything else and often drew this compliment  
well done miss anne very well done indeed  lord bless me
how those little fingers of yours fly about

so passed the first three weeks  michaelmas came and now anne s heart
must be in kellynch again  a beloved home made over to others
all the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospects
beginning to own other eyes and other limbs  she could not
think of much else on the 29th of september and she had this
sympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasion
to note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not this
the day the crofts were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did not
think of it before  how low it makes me

the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were
to be visited  mary deplored the necessity for herself 
nobody knew how much she should suffer  she should put it off
as long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charles
into driving her over on an early day and was in a very animated
comfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came back 
anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going 
she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within
when the visit was returned  they came  the master of the house
was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced
that mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by mary
and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice
of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness
and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice
or in the turn of sentiment and expression

mrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squareness
uprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her person 
she had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable face
though her reddened and weather beaten complexion the consequence
of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem to
have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight and thirty 
her manners were open easy and decided like one who had
no distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without any
approach to coarseness however or any want of good humour 
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration
towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her 
especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute
in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest
symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft s side to give a bias
of any sort  she was quite easy on that head and consequently
full of strength and courage till for a moment electrified by
mrs croft s suddenly saying  

it was you and not your sister i find that my brother had
the pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this country

anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion
she certainly had not

perhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croft

she could now answer as she ought and was happy to feel
when mrs croft s next words explained it to be mr wentworth
of whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not do
for either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it was
that mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edward
and not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulness
applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour s
present state with proper interest

the rest was all tranquillity till just as they were moving
she heard the admiral say to mary  

we are expecting a brother of mrs croft s here soon i dare say
you know him by name

he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys
clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go
and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away
in his coat pockets  c to have another moment for finishing
or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself
as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question 
she could not however reach such a degree of certainty
as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject
at the other house where the crofts had previously been calling

the folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this day
at the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visits
to be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened for
when the youngest miss musgrove walked in  that she was coming
to apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves
was the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affronted
when louisa made all right by saying that she only came on foot
to leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriage

and i will tell you our reason she added and all about it 
i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are
out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much
of poor richard  and we agreed it would be best to have the harp
for it seems to amuse her more than the piano forte  i will tell you
why she is out of spirits  when the crofts called this morning
they called here afterwards did not they they happened to say
that her brother captain wentworth is just returned to england
or paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directly
and most unluckily it came into mamma s head when they were gone
that wentworth or something very like it was the name of
poor richard s captain at one time i do not know when or where
but a great while before he died poor fellow  and upon looking over
his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure
that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it
and of poor richard  so we must be as merry as we can that she may not
be dwelling upon such gloomy things

the real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were
that the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome
hopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reached
his twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid
and unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared for
at any time by his family though quite as much as he deserved
seldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligence
of his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years before

he had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for him
by calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick headed
unfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anything
to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name
living or dead

he had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removals
to which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmen
as every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on board
captain frederick wentworth s frigate the laconia and from the laconia
he had under the influence of his captain written the only two letters
which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole
of his absence that is to say the only two disinterested letters
all the rest had been mere applications for money

in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet
so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters
so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships
that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove
should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection
of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those
extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur 

she had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposed
and the re perusal of these letters after so long an interval
her poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgotten
had affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her into
greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death 
mr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and when
they reached the cottage they were evidently in want first
of being listened to anew on this subject and afterwards
of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them

to hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his name
so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might
that it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworth
whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back
from clifton  a very fine young man  but they could not say whether
it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne s nerves 
she found however that it was one to which she must inure herself 
since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself
to be insensible on such points  and not only did it appear that
he was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitude
for the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respect
for his character stamped as it was by poor dick s having been
six months under his care and mentioning him in strong
though not perfectly well spelt praise as a fine dashing felow
only two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent on
introducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon as
they could hear of his arrival

the resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening



chapter 7


a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynch
and mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praise
and he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercross
by the end of another week  it had been a great disappointment
to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed
so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth
under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest
and best in his cellars  but a week must pass only a week
in anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet
and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week

captain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove s civility
and she was all but calling there in the same half hour 
she and mary were actually setting forward for the great house
where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him
when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment
brought home in consequence of a bad fall  the child s situation
put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape
with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety
which they afterwards felt on his account

his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury
received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas 
it was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at once
the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed
the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control
the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend
and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it
proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession
rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants

her brother s return was the first comfort he could take best care
of his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary 
till he came and had examined the child their apprehensions were
the worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not where
but now the collar bone was soon replaced and though mr robinson
felt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low words
both to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the best
and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind
and then it was just before they parted that the two young aunts
were able so far to digress from their nephew s state as to give
the information of captain wentworth s visit staying five minutes behind
their father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted
they were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeable
they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance
who had been at all a favourite before  how glad they had been
to hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he said
it was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promised
in reply to papa and mamma s farther pressing invitations to come
and dine with them on the morrow  actually on the morrow
and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he felt
all the motive of their attention just as he ought  and in short
he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace
that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him
and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently
more full of captain wentworth than of little charles

the same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls came
with their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiries
and mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir
could add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be now
no occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to think
that the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boy
to give him the meeting  oh no as to leaving the little boy
both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escape
could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs

charles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclination
the child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introduced
to captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the evening
he would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hour 
but in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh no indeed
charles i cannot bear to have you go away  only think if anything
should happen

the child had a good night and was going on well the next day 
it must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been
done to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarm
and charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessity
for longer confinement  the child was to be kept in bed and amused
as quietly as possible but what was there for a father to do 
this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him
who could be of no use at home to shut himself up  his father
very much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there being
no sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in his
making a bold public declaration when he came in from shooting
of his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other house

nothing can be going on better than the child said he
so i told my father just now that i would come and he thought me
quite right  your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at all 
you would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no use 
anne will send for me if anything is the matter

husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain 
mary knew from charles s manner of speaking that he was
quite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze him 
she said nothing therefore till he was out of the room
but as soon as there was only anne to hear  

so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with this
poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening 
i knew how it would be  this is always my luck  if there is
anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it
and charles is as bad as any of them  very unfeeling  i must say
it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boy 
talks of his being going on so well  how does he know that he is
going on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence 
i did not think charles would have been so unfeeling  so here he is to
go away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor mother
i am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfit
than anybody else to be about the child  my being the mother
is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  i am not at all
equal to it  you saw how hysterical i was yesterday

but that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm  
of the shock  you will not be hysterical again  i dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us  i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions
and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband 
nursing does not belong to a man it is not his province 
a sick child is always the mother s property  her own feelings
generally make it so

i hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not know
that i am of any more use in the sick room than charles
for i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill
and you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiet
he was sure to begin kicking about  i have not nerves
for the sort of thing

but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending
the whole evening away from the poor boy

yes you see his papa can and why should not i  jemima is so careful
and she could send us word every hour how he was  i really think
charles might as well have told his father we would all come 
i am not more alarmed about little charles now than he is 
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day

well if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself
suppose you were to go as well as your husband  leave little charles
to my care  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remain
with him

are you serious cried mary her eyes brightening  dear me
that s a very good thought very good indeed  to be sure
i may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home  am i
and it only harasses me  you who have not a mother s feelings
are a great deal the properest person  you can make little charles
do anything he always minds you at a word  it will be a great deal better
than leaving him only with jemima  oh i shall certainly go
i am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want me
excessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i know
you do not mind being left alone  an excellent thought of yours
indeed anne  i will go and tell charles and get ready directly 
you can send for us you know at a moment s notice if anything
is the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm you 
i should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at ease
about my dear child

the next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door
and as anne followed her up stairs she was in time for
the whole conversation which began with mary s saying
in a tone of great exultation  

i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home
than you are  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the child
i should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like 
anne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him 
it is anne s own proposal and so i shall go with you which will be
a great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesday

this is very kind of anne was her husband s answer and i should be
very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be
left at home by herself to nurse our sick child

anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity
of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction
was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being
left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening
when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her
to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable
and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them
set off together in high spirits  they were gone she hoped
to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem
as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort
as were perhaps ever likely to be hers  she knew herself to be
of the first utility to the child and what was it to her
if frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself
agreeable to others

she would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting 
perhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstances 
he must be either indifferent or unwilling  had he wished
ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time
he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place
she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him
the independence which alone had been wanting

her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance
and their visit in general  there had been music singing
talking laughing all that was most agreeable charming manners
in captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed all
to know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morning
to shoot with charles  he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottage
though that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressed
to come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of being
in mrs charles musgrove s way on account of the child and therefore
somehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles s being to meet him
to breakfast at his father s

anne understood it  he wished to avoid seeing her  he had inquired
after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance
seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps
by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet

the morning hours of the cottage were always later than those
of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great
that mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast when
charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was
come for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworth
his sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworth
proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient
and though charles had answered for the child s being in no such state
as could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfied
without his running on to give notice

mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him
while a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this was
the most consoling that it would soon be over  and it was soon over 
in two minutes after charles s preparation the others appeared
they were in the drawing room  her eye half met captain wentworth s
a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to mary
said all that was right said something to the miss musgroves
enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons
and voices but a few minutes ended it  charles shewed himself
at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone
the miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk
to the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was cleared
and anne might finish her breakfast as she could 

it is over it is over she repeated to herself again and again
in nervous gratitude  the worst is over

mary talked but she could not attend  she had seen him 
they had met  they had been once more in the same room

soon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling less 
eight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given up 
how absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval
had banished into distance and indistinctness  what might not
eight years do  events of every description changes alienations
removals  all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past  
how natural how certain too  it included nearly a third part
of her own life

alas with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing

now how were his sentiments to be read  was this like
wishing to avoid her  and the next moment she was hating herself
for the folly which asked the question

on one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom
might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense
for after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visit
at the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary   

captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he was
so attentive to me  henrietta asked him what he thought of you
when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not
have known you again

mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister s in a common way
but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar wound

altered beyond his knowledge  anne fully submitted in silent
deep mortification  doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge
for he was not altered or not for the worse  she had already
acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently
let him think of her as he would  no  the years which had destroyed
her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly
open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages 
she had seen the same frederick wentworth

so altered that he should not have known her again  these were words
which could not but dwell with her  yet she soon began to rejoice
that she had heard them  they were of sobering tendency
they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must
make her happier

frederick wentworth had used such words or something like them
but without an idea that they would be carried round to her 
he had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal
had spoken as he felt  he had not forgiven anne elliot 
she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse
she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided
confident temper could not endure  she had given him up to oblige others 
it had been the effect of over persuasion  it had been
weakness and timidity

he had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since
whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation
of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  her power with him
was gone for ever

it was now his object to marry  he was rich and being turned on shore
fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted
actually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speed
which a clear head and a quick taste could allow  he had a heart
for either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heart
in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way
excepting anne elliot  this was his only secret exception
when he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions  

yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match 
anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking 
a little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navy
and i am a lost man  should not this be enough for a sailor
who has had no society among women to make him nice

he said it she knew to be contradicted  his bright proud eye
spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was
not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described
the woman he should wish to meet with  a strong mind
with sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the description 

that is the woman i want said he  something a little inferior
i shall of course put up with but it must not be much  if i am a fool
i shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subject
more than most men



chapter 8


from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedly
in the same circle  they were soon dining in company together
at mr musgrove s for the little boy s state could no longer
supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this was
but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings

whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof
former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each
they could not but be reverted to the year of their engagement
could not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth  his profession qualified him
his disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year six
that happened before i went to sea in the year six occurred
in the course of the first evening they spent together 
and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason
to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke
anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind
that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself 
there must be the same immediate association of thought
though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain

they had no conversation together no intercourse but what
the commonest civility required  once so much to each other 
now nothing  there had been a time when of all the large party
now filling the drawing room at uppercross they would have found it
most difficult to cease to speak to one another  with the exception
perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached
and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among
the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open
no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved 
now they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they could
never become acquainted  it was a perpetual estrangement

when he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind 
there was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party
and he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroves
who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner
of living on board daily regulations food hours  c and their surprise
at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement
which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule
which reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant
and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board
without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were
or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use

from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper
of mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying  

ah miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor son
i dare say he would have been just such another by this time

anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgrove
relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others

when she could let her attention take its natural course again
she found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy list
their own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercross
and sitting down together to pore over it with the professed view
of finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commanded

your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp

you will not find her there  quite worn out and broken up 
i was the last man who commanded her  hardly fit for service then 
reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off
to the west indies

the girls looked all amazement

the admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and then
with sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employed 
but they have a great many to provide for and among the thousands
that may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossible
for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed

phoo phoo cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk 
never was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloop
you would not see her equal  lucky fellow to get her  he knows there
must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her
at the same time  lucky fellow to get anything so soon
with no more interest than his

i felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworth
seriously  i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desire 
it was a great object with me at that time to be at sea
a very great object i wanted to be doing something

to be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashore
for half a year together  if a man had not a wife he soon wants
to be afloat again

but captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have been
when you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given you

i knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smiling 
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to
the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen
lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember
and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself 
ah she was a dear old asp to me  she did all that i wanted 
i knew she would  i knew that we should either go to the bottom together
or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days
of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after
taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck
in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate
i wanted  i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luck 
we had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came on
which lasted four days and nights and which would have done for
poor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nation
not having much improved our condition  four and twenty hours later
and i should only have been a gallant captain wentworth
in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lost
in only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne s shudderings
were to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as open
as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror

and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice
as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there
he met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to her
do ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother 
i always forgot

it was at gibraltar mother i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltar
with a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworth

oh but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraid
of mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasure
to hear him talked of by such a good friend

charles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case
only nodded in reply and walked away

the girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworth
could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume
into his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloud
the little statement of her name and rate and present
non commissioned class observing over it that she too had been
one of the best friends man ever had

ah those were pleasant days when i had the laconia  how fast i
made money in her  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruise
together off the western islands  poor harville sister 
you know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  he had a wife 
excellent fellow  i shall never forget his happiness  he felt it all
so much for her sake  i wished for him again the next summer
when i had still the same luck in the mediterranean

and i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for us
when you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forget
what you did

her feelings made her speak low and captain wentworth
hearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at all
near his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for more

my brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinking
of poor richard

poor dear fellow continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steady
and such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care 
ah it would have been a happy thing if he had never left you 
i assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left you

there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech
a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth
which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes
as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him
but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected
by any who understood him less than herself in another moment
he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards
coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting
took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her
in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy
and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all
that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings

they were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove had
most readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgrove 
it was no insignificant barrier indeed  mrs musgrove was of
a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature
to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment
and while the agitations of anne s slender form and pensive face
may be considered as very completely screened captain wentworth
should be allowed some credit for the self command with which
he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son
whom alive nobody had cared for

personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions 
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction
as the most graceful set of limbs in the world  but fair or not fair
there are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain  
which taste cannot tolerate  which ridicule will seize

the admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with his hands behind him being called to order by his wife
now came up to captain wentworth and without any observation
of what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughts
began with  

if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederick
you would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary grierson
and her daughters

should i  i am glad i was not a week later then

the admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  he defended himself
though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies
on board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visit
which a few hours might comprehend

but if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantry
towards them  it is rather from feeling how impossible it is
with all one s efforts and all one s sacrifices to make
the accommodations on board such as women ought to have 
there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women
to every personal comfort high and this is what i do  i hate to hear
of women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my command
shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help it

this brought his sister upon him

oh frederick  but i cannot believe it of you   all idle refinement
  women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in england 
i believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i know
nothing superior to the accommodations of a man of war  i declare
i have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hall
with a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most of
the ships i have lived in and they have been five altogether

nothing to the purpose replied her brother  you were living
with your husband and were the only woman on board

but you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousin
and three children round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was this
superfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then

all merged in my friendship sophia  i would assist any
brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything
of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it  but do not imagine
that i did not feel it an evil in itself

depend upon it they were all perfectly comfortable

i might not like them the better for that perhaps  such a number
of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board

my dear frederick you are talking quite idly  pray what would
become of us poor sailors wives who often want to be conveyed to
one port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelings

my feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harville
and all her family to plymouth

but i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman
and as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatures 
we none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days

ah my dear said the admiral when he had got a wife
he will sing a different tune  when he is married if we have
the good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and i
and a great many others have done  we shall have him very thankful
to anybody that will bring him his wife

ay that we shall

now i have done cried captain wentworth  when once married
people begin to attack me with  oh you will think very differently
when you are married  i can only say no i shall not and then
they say again yes you will and there is an end of it

he got up and moved away

what a great traveller you must have been ma am said mrs musgrove
to mrs croft

pretty well ma am in the fifteen years of my marriage
though many women have done more  i have crossed the atlantic
four times and have been once to the east indies and back again
and only once besides being in different places about home 
cork and lisbon and gibraltar  but i never went beyond the streights
and never was in the west indies  we do not call bermuda or bahama
you know the west indies

mrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herself
of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life

and i do assure you ma am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceed
the accommodations of a man of war i speak you know of the higher rates 
when you come to a frigate of course you are more confined
though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them
and i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spent
on board a ship  while we were together you know there was nothing
to be feared  thank god  i have always been blessed with
excellent health and no climate disagrees with me  a little disordered
always the first twenty four hours of going to sea but never knew
what sickness was afterwards  the only time i ever really suffered
in body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwell
or had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at deal
when the admiral captain croft then was in the north seas 
i lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself
or when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be together
nothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenience

aye to be sure  yes indeed oh yes  i am quite of your opinion
mrs croft was mrs musgrove s hearty answer  there is nothing so bad
as a separation  i am quite of your opinion  i know what it is
for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when
they are over and he is safe back again

the evening ended with dancing  on its being proposed
anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes
fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad
to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved

it was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spirits
than captain wentworth  she felt that he had every thing to elevate
him which general attention and deference and especially the attention
of all the young women could do  the miss hayters the females
of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted
to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa
they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but
the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves
could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals 
if he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admiration
who could wonder

these were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingers
were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together
equally without error and without consciousness  once she felt
that he was looking at herself  observing her altered features
perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once
charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her
she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was
sure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never danced 
the answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancing 
she had rather play  she is never tired of playing  once too
he spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the dancing being over
and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished
to give the miss musgroves an idea of  unintentionally she returned
to that part of the room he saw her and instantly rising
said with studied politeness  

i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately
drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced
to sit down again

anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches 
his cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anything



chapter 9


captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stay
as long as he liked being as thoroughly the object of
the admiral s fraternal kindness as of his wife s  he had intended
on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire
and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions
of uppercross induced him to put this off  there was so much
of friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitching
in his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeable
that he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take all
the charms and perfections of edward s wife upon credit a little longer

it was soon uppercross with him almost every day  the musgroves
could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularly
in the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiral
and mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselves
in their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a gig
lately added to their establishment

hitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworth
among the musgroves and their dependencies  it was unvarying
warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more
than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them
to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth
very much in the way

charles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiable
pleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had been
a considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth s
introduction  he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhood
where residence was not required lived at his father s house
only two miles from uppercross  a short absence from home
had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period
and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners
and of seeing captain wentworth

mrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters  they had each had money
but their marriages had made a material difference in
their degree of consequence  mr hayter had some property of his own
but it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove s and while
the musgroves were in the first class of society in the country
the young hayters would from their parents inferior retired
and unpolished way of living and their own defective education
have been hardly in any class at all but for their connexion
with uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosen
to be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superior
in cultivation and manners to all the rest

the two families had always been on excellent terms there being no pride
on one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousness
of superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleased
to improve their cousins  charles s attentions to henrietta
had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation 
it would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him  
and henrietta did seem to like him

henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came
but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten

which of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth was
as yet quite doubtful as far as anne s observation reached 
henrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spirits
and she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively character
were most likely to attract him

mr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or from
an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters
and of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everything
to take its chance  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitude
or remark about them in the mansion house but it was different
at the cottage  the young couple there were more disposed
to speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been above
four or five times in the miss musgroves company and charles hayter
had but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinions
of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best 
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing
that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful

charles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from what
he had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure that
he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war 
here was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chance
of what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworth
was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy 
oh it would be a capital match for either of his sisters

upon my word it would replied mary  dear me  if he should
rise to any very great honours  if he should ever be made a baronet
lady wentworth sounds very well  that would be a noble thing
indeed for henrietta  she would take place of me then and henrietta
would not dislike that  sir frederick and lady wentworth 
it would be but a new creation however and i never think much
of your new creations

it suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferred
on the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wished
to see put an end to  she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters
and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection
between the families renewed  very sad for herself and her children

you know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henrietta
and considering the alliances which the musgroves have made
she has no right to throw herself away  i do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her family and be giving bad connections
to those who have not been used to them  and pray who is charles hayter 
nothing but a country curate  a most improper match for miss musgrove
of uppercross

her husband however would not agree with her here for besides having
a regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest son
and he saw things as an eldest son himself

now you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answer 
it would not be a great match for henrietta but charles has
a very fair chance through the spicers of getting something from
the bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to remember
that he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into very
pretty property  the estate at winthrop is not less than
two hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near taunton
which is some of the best land in the country  i grant you
that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta
and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible
but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop
comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it
and live in a very different sort of way and with that property
he will never be a contemptible man  good freehold property  no no
henrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has him
and louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfied

charles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon as
he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henrietta
marry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse
for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworth
may soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubt
that he has  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterday 
i wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as to
captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense
to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best 
but charles is so positive  i wish you had been with us yesterday
for then you might have decided between us and i am sure you
would have thought as i did unless you had been determined
to give it against me

a dinner at mr musgrove s had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by anne but she had staid at home
under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return
of indisposition in little charles  she had thought only of avoiding
captain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpire
was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening

as to captain wentworth s views she deemed it of more consequence
that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering
the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour
than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta 
either of them would in all probability make him an affectionate
good humoured wife  with regard to charles hayter she had delicacy
which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well meaning
young woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings
it occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature
of her feelings the alternation could not be understood too soon

charles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him
in his cousin s behaviour  she had too old a regard for him
to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish
every past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep away
from uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarming
when such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded as
the probable cause  he had been absent only two sundays
and when they parted had left her interested even to the height
of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy
and obtaining that of uppercross instead  it had then seemed the object
nearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more than
forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office
but was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixed
on engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as good
as he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of it 
the advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of going
six miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacy
of his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley s
being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through
without most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisa
but had been almost everything to henrietta  when he came back alas
the zeal of the business was gone by  louisa could not listen at all
to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley 
she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta
had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten
all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation

well i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have it
i always thought you sure  it did not appear to me that  in short
you know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promise 
is he coming louisa

one morning very soon after the dinner at the musgroves
at which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked into
the drawing room at the cottage where were only herself and the little
invalid charles who was lying on the sofa

the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot
deprived his manners of their usual composure  he started
and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here 
mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked
to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave

they are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few moments
i dare say had been anne s reply in all the confusion that was natural
and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him
she would have been out of the room the next moment and released
captain wentworth as well as herself

he continued at the window and after calmly and politely saying
i hope the little boy is better was silent

she was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain there
to satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minutes
when to her very great satisfaction she heard some other person
crossing the little vestibule  she hoped on turning her head
to see the master of the house but it proved to be one
much less calculated for making matters easy  charles hayter
probably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworth
than captain wentworth had been by the sight of anne

she only attempted to say how do you do  will you not sit down 
the others will be here presently

captain wentworth however came from his window apparently
not ill disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an end
to his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking up
the newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his window

another minute brought another addition  the younger boy
a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door
opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance
among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on
and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away

there being nothing to eat he could only have some play
and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother
he began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way that
busy as she was about charles she could not shake him off 
she spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vain 
once she did contrive to push him away but the boy had
the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly

walter said she get down this moment  you are extremely troublesome 
i am very angry with you

walter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are bid 
do not you hear your aunt speak  come to me walter come to
cousin charles

but not a bit did walter stir

in another moment however she found herself in the state of
being released from him some one was taking him from her
though he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy hands
were unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne away
before she knew that captain wentworth had done it

her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless 
she could not even thank him  she could only hang over little charles
with most disordered feelings  his kindness in stepping forward
to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed
the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon
forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child
that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought
to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants
produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation
as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary
and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares
and leave the room  she could not stay  it might have been
an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four  
they were now altogether but she could stay for none of it 
it was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towards
captain wentworth  she had a strong impression of his having said
in a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth s interference
you ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your aunt
and could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should do
what he ought to have done himself  but neither charles hayter s feelings
nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had a little better
arranged her own  she was ashamed of herself quite ashamed
of being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it was
and it required a long application of solitude and reflection
to recover her



chapter 10


other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur 
anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at home
where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife
for while she considered louisa to be rather the favourite
she could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memory
and experience that captain wentworth was not in love with either 
they were more in love with him yet there it was not love 
it was a little fever of admiration but it might probably must
end in love with some  charles hayter seemed aware of being slighted
and yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them 
anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about
and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to 
she did not attribute guile to any  it was the highest satisfaction
to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware
of the pain he was occasioning  there was no triumph no pitiful triumph
in his manner  he had probably never heard and never thought of
any claims of charles hayter  he was only wrong in accepting
the attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at once

after a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the field 
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross
a most decided change  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinner
and having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large books
before him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be right
and talked with grave faces of his studying himself to death 
it was mary s hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal
from henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependence
of seeing him to morrow  anne could only feel that charles hayter
was wise

one morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworth
being gone a shooting together as the sisters in the cottage
were sitting quietly at work they were visited at the window
by the sisters from the mansion house

it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came
through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say
that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded
mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied
with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes
i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk
anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely
what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity
which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being
to be communicated and everything being to be done together
however undesired and inconvenient  she tried to dissuade mary from going
but in vain and that being the case thought it best to accept
the miss musgroves much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise
as she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lessening
the interference in any plan of their own

i cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walk
said mary as she went up stairs  everybody is always supposing
that i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleased
if we had refused to join them  when people come in this manner
on purpose to ask us how can one say no

just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  they had taken out
a young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back early 
their time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly ready
for this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  could anne
have foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home but
from some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it was
too late to retract and the whole six set forward together
in the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidently
considered the walk as under their guidance

anne s object was not to be in the way of anybody and where
the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary
to keep with her brother and sister  her pleasure in the walk
must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of
the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges
and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical
descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and
inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness
that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read
some attempt at description or some lines of feeling 
she occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings
and quotations but it was not possible that when within reach
of captain wentworth s conversation with either of the miss musgroves
she should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkable 
it was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footing
might fall into  he was more engaged with louisa than with henrietta 
louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister 
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech
of louisa s which struck her  after one of the many praises of the day
which were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added   

what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister  they meant to take
a long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them from
some of these hills  they talked of coming into this side of the country 
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day  oh it does happen
very often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of it
she would as lieve be tossed out as not

ah you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it were
really so i should do just the same in her place  if i loved a man
as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever
separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely
by anybody else

it was spoken with enthusiasm

had you cried he catching the same tone i honour you 
and there was silence between them for a little while

anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  the sweet scenes
of autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnet
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declining
happiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone together
blessed her memory  she roused herself to say as they struck by order
into another path is not this one of the ways to winthrop 
but nobody heard or at least nobody answered her

winthrop however or its environs  for young men are sometimes
to be met with strolling about near home  was their destination
and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures
where the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmer
counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaning
to have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hill
which parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full view
of the latter at the foot of the hill on the other side

winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them
an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm yard

mary exclaimed bless me here is winthrop  i declare i had no idea 
well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tired

henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles
walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready
to do as mary wished but no said charles musgrove and no no
cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to be
arguing the matter warmly

charles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolution
of calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidently
though more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go too 
but this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength
and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter
of an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answered
oh no indeed walking up that hill again would do her more harm
than any sitting down could do her good and in short
her look and manner declared that go she would not

after a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations
it was settled between charles and his two sisters that he
and henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their aunt
and cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the top
of the hill  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan
and as she went a little way with them down the hill still talking
to henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her
and saying to captain wentworth  

it is very unpleasant having such connexions  but i assure you
i have never been in the house above twice in my life

she received no other answer than an artificial assenting smile
followed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anne
perfectly knew the meaning of

the brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spot 
louisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herself
on the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the others
all stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth away
to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge row
and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound
mary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seat
was sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing could
prevent her from going to look for a better also  she turned through
the same gate but could not see them  anne found a nice seat
for her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge row in which
she had no doubt of their still being in some spot or other 
mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa
had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on
till she overtook her

anne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heard
captain wentworth and louisa in the hedge row behind her as if
making their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down the
centre  they were speaking as they drew near  louisa s voice was
the first distinguished  she seemed to be in the middle of some
eager speech  what anne first heard was  

and so i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense  what would i be turned back from
doing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be right
by the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may say 
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded  when i have
made up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirely
to have made up hers to call at winthrop to day and yet she was as near
giving it up out of nonsensical complaisance

she would have turned back then but for you

she would indeed  i am almost ashamed to say it

happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand  after the hints
you gave just now which did but confirm my own observations
the last time i was in company with him  i need not affect
to have no comprehension of what is going on  i see that more than
a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question
and woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequence
when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and
strength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resist
idle interference in such a trifle as this  your sister is
an amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmness
i see  if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as much
of your own spirit into her as you can  but this no doubt
you have been always doing  it is the worst evil of too yielding
and indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended on 
you are never sure of a good impression being durable everybody
may sway it  let those who would be happy be firm  here is a nut
said he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplify 
a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength
has outlived all the storms of autumn  not a puncture not
a weak spot anywhere  this nut he continued with playful solemnity
while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot
is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be
supposed capable of  then returning to his former earnest tone  
my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firm 
if louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of life
she will cherish all her present powers of mind

he had done and was unanswered  it would have surprised anne if louisa
could have readily answered such a speech  words of such interest
spoken with such serious warmth  she could imagine what louisa was feeling 
for herself she feared to move lest she should be seen 
while she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected her
and they were moving on  before they were beyond her hearing
however louisa spoke again 

mary is good natured enough in many respects said she
but she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsense
and pride   the elliot pride  she has a great deal too much
of the elliot pride  we do so wish that charles had married anne instead 
i suppose you know he wanted to marry anne

after a moment s pause captain wentworth said  

do you mean that she refused him

oh yes certainly

when did that happen

i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time
but i believe about a year before he married mary  i wish she had
accepted him  we should all have liked her a great deal better
and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend
lady russell s doing that she did not  they think charles
might not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russell
and that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse him

the sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no more 
her own emotions still kept her fixed  she had much to recover from
before she could move  the listener s proverbial fate was
not absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had heard
a great deal of very painful import  she saw how her own character
was considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degree
of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her
extreme agitation

as soon as she could she went after mary and having found
and walked back with her to their former station by the stile
felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards
collected and once more in motion together  her spirits wanted
the solitude and silence which only numbers could give

charles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjectured
charles hayter with them  the minutiae of the business anne
could not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seem
admitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawing
on the gentleman s side and a relenting on the lady s and that they
were now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubt 
henrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased  
charles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each other
almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercross

everything now marked out louisa for captain wentworth
nothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessary
or even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as much
as the other two  in a long strip of meadow land where there was
ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties
and to that party of the three which boasted least animation
and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged  she joined charles
and mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles s other arm
but charles though in very good humour with her was out of temper
with his wife  mary had shewn herself disobliging to him
and was now to reap the consequence which consequence was
his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads
of some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary began
to complain of it and lament her being ill used according to custom
in being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the other
he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had
a momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at all

this long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of it
was to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exit
the carriage advancing in the same direction which had been
some time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral croft s gig 
he and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning home 
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in
they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired
it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross 
the invitation was general and generally declined  the miss musgroves
were not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being asked
before any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pride
could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise

the walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting an
opposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion again
when captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his sister  the something might be guessed by its effects

miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft 
do let us have the pleasure of taking you home  here is excellent room
for three i assure you  if we were all like you i believe we might
sit four  you must indeed you must

anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline
she was not allowed to proceed  the admiral s kind urgency
came in support of his wife s they would not be refused
they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space
to leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a word
turned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage

yes he had done it  she was in the carriage and felt that he had
placed her there that his will and his hands had done it
that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolution
to give her rest  she was very much affected by the view of
his disposition towards her which all these things made apparent 
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before 
she understood him  he could not forgive her but he could not
be unfeeling  though condemning her for the past and considering it
with high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of her
and though becoming attached to another still he could not see her suffer
without the desire of giving her relief  it was a remainder
of former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledged
friendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart
which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded
of pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailed

her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions
were at first unconsciously given  they had travelled half their way
along the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they said 
she then found them talking of frederick

he certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophy
said the admiral but there is no saying which  he has been
running after them too long enough one would think to make up his mind 
ay this comes of the peace  if it were war now he would have
settled it long ago  we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to make
long courtships in time of war  how many days was it my dear
between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together
in our lodgings at north yarmouth

we had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantly
for if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding
she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together 
i had known you by character however long before

well and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were we
to wait for besides  i do not like having such things so long in hand 
i wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us home
one of these young ladies to kellynch  then there would always
be company for them  and very nice young ladies they both are
i hardly know one from the other

very good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croft
in a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect that
her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy
of her brother and a very respectable family  one could not be
connected with better people  my dear admiral that post
we shall certainly take that post

but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily
passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out
her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung cart
and anne with some amusement at their style of driving
which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance
of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage 



chapter 11


the time now approached for lady russell s return  the day was even fixed
and anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled
was looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginning
to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it

it would place her in the same village with captain wentworth
within half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same church
and there must be intercourse between the two families 
this was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his time
at uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered rather
as leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the whole
she believed she must on this interesting question be the gainer
almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society
in leaving poor mary for lady russell

she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing
captain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessed
former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her
but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and
captain wentworth never meeting anywhere  they did not like each other
and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russell
to see them together she might think that he had too much self possession
and she too little

these points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating
her removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationed
quite long enough  her usefulness to little charles would always
give some sweetness to the memory of her two months visit there
but he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay for

the conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a way
which she had not at all imagined  captain wentworth after being unseen
and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them
to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away

a letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at last
had brought intelligence of captain harville s being settled
with his family at lyme for the winter of their being therefore
quite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  captain harville
had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received
two years before and captain wentworth s anxiety to see him
had determined him to go immediately to lyme  he had been there
for four and twenty hours  his acquittal was complete
his friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friend
and his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended to
by the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselves
and a project for going thither was the consequence

the young people were all wild to see lyme  captain wentworth talked
of going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercross
though november the weather was by no means bad and in short
louisa who was the most eager of the eager having formed
the resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked
being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way
bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off
till summer and to lyme they were to go  charles mary anne henrietta
louisa and captain wentworth

the first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at night
but to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consent
and when it came to be rationally considered a day in
the middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new place
after deducting seven hours as the nature of the country required
for going and returning  they were consequently to stay the night there
and not to be expected back till the next day s dinner  this was felt
to be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great house
at rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctually
it was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove s coach
containing the four ladies and charles s curricle in which
he drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lyme
and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself
that it was very evident they would not have more than time
for looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were gone

after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns
the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea  they were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which lyme as a public place might offer  the rooms
were shut up the lodgers almost all gone scarcely any family
but of the residents left and as there is nothing to admire
in the buildings themselves the remarkable situation of the town
the principal street almost hurrying into the water the walk to the cobb
skirting round the pleasant little bay which in the season
is animated with bathing machines and company the cobb itself
its old wonders and new improvements with the very beautiful
line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are what
the stranger s eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must be
who does not see charms in the immediate environs of lyme
to make him wish to know it better  the scenes in its neighbourhood
charmouth with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country
and still more its sweet retired bay backed by dark cliffs
where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot
for watching the flow of the tide for sitting in unwearied contemplation
the woody varieties of the cheerful village of up lyme and above all
pinny with its green chasms between romantic rocks where
the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth
declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first
partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state
where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far famed
isle of wight  these places must be visited and visited again
to make the worth of lyme understood

the party from uppercross passing down by the now deserted
and melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselves
on the sea shore and lingering only as all must linger and gaze
on a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at all
proceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itself
and on captain wentworth s account  for in a small house
near the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settled 
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on
and he was to join them on the cobb

they were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisa
seemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth long
when they saw him coming after them with three companions
all well known already by description to be captain and mrs harville
and a captain benwick who was staying with them

captain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconia
and the account which captain wentworth had given of him
on his return from lyme before his warm praise of him as
an excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highly
which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener
had been followed by a little history of his private life
which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies 
he had been engaged to captain harville s sister and was now
mourning her loss  they had been a year or two waiting for fortune
and promotion  fortune came his prize money as lieutenant being great
promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it 
she had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  captain wentworth
believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman
than poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeply
afflicted under the dreadful change  he considered his disposition
as of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelings
with quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for reading
and sedentary pursuits  to finish the interest of the story
the friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possible
augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance
and captain benwick was now living with them entirely  captain harville
had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health
and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive
and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement
of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s
state of mind  the sympathy and good will excited towards captain benwick
was very great

and yet said anne to herself as they now moved forward
to meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heart
than i have  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever 
he is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in fact
younger as a man  he will rally again and be happy with another

they all met and were introduced  captain harville was a tall
dark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lame
and from strong features and want of health looking much older
than captain wentworth  captain benwick looked and was
the youngest of the three and compared with either of them
a little man  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy air
just as he ought to have and drew back from conversation

captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners
was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging 
mrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed however
to have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasant
than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own
because the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitable
than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them 
the dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillingly
accepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworth
should have brought any such party to lyme without considering it
as a thing of course that they should dine with them

there was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all this
and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon
so unlike the usual style of give and take invitations and dinners
of formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to be
benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother officers 
these would have been all my friends was her thought
and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness

on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many  anne had
a moment s astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lost
in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all
the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harville
to turn the actual space to the best account to supply the deficiencies
of lodging house furniture and defend the windows and doors
against the winter storms to be expected  the varieties in
the fitting up of the rooms where the common necessaries
provided by the owner in the common indifferent plight
were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood
excellently worked up and with something curious and valuable
from all the distant countries captain harville had visited
were more than amusing to anne connected as it all was with his profession
the fruit of its labours the effect of its influence on his habits
the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented
made it to her a something more or less than gratification

captain harville was no reader but he had contrived
excellent accommodations and fashioned very pretty shelves
for a tolerable collection of well bound volumes the property of
captain benwick  his lameness prevented him from taking much exercise
but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with
constant employment within  he drew he varnished he carpentered
he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles
and pins with improvements and if everything else was done
sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room

anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they
quitted the house and louisa by whom she found herself walking
burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character
of the navy their friendliness their brotherliness their openness
their uprightness protesting that she was convinced of sailors having
more worth and warmth than any other set of men in england
that they only knew how to live and they only deserved to be
respected and loved

they went back to dress and dine and so well had the scheme
answered already that nothing was found amiss though its being
so entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lyme
and the no expectation of company had brought many apologies
from the heads of the inn

anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened
to being in captain wentworth s company than she had at first imagined
could ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him now
and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it
they never got beyond was become a mere nothing

the nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow
but captain harville had promised them a visit in the evening
and he came bringing his friend also which was more than
had been expected it having been agreed that captain benwick
had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of
so many strangers  he ventured among them again however
though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth
of the party in general

while captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the room
and by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne s lot to be placed
rather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulse
of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him 
he was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness of
her countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effect
and anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion 
he was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading
though principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of having
given him at least an evening s indulgence in the discussion of subjects
which his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hope
of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and
benefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown out
of their conversation  for though shy he did not seem reserved
it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their
usual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness of
the present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinion
as to the first rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmion
or the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaour
and the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronounced
he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs
of the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony
of the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lines
which imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchedness
and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood
that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry
and to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be
seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely
and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly
were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly

his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion
to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself
the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend
a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested
to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists
such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters
of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment
as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts
and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances

captain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful for
the interest implied and though with a shake of the head
and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books
on grief like his noted down the names of those she recommended
and promised to procure and read them

when the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the idea
of her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young man
whom she had never seen before nor could she help fearing
on more serious reflection that like many other great moralists
and preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct
would ill bear examination



chapter 12


anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the party
the next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast 
they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide
which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur
which so flat a shore admitted  they praised the morning
gloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh feeling
breeze  and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with  

oh yes  i am quite convinced that with very few exceptions
the sea air always does good  there can be no doubt of its having been
of the greatest service to dr shirley after his illness
last spring twelve month  he declares himself that coming to lyme
for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took
and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again 
now i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live
entirely by the sea  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirely
and fix at lyme  do not you anne  do not you agree with me
that it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirley 
she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would
make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad
to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand
in case of his having another seizure  indeed i think it quite melancholy
to have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have been
doing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a place
like uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut out
from all the world  i wish his friends would propose it to him 
i really think they ought  and as to procuring a dispensation
there could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his character 
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish 
he is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over scrupulous
i must say  do not you think anne it is being over scrupulous 
do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience
when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties
which may be just as well performed by another person  and at lyme too
only seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hear
if people thought there was anything to complain of

anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech
and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into
the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good
of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence 
she said all that was reasonable and proper on the business
felt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how very
desirable it was that he should have some active respectable young man
as a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint at
the advantage of such resident curate s being married

i wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companion
i wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimate
with dr shirley  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman of
the greatest influence with everybody  i always look upon her as able
to persuade a person to anything  i am afraid of her as i have
told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever
but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour
at uppercross

anne was amused by henrietta s manner of being grateful
and amused also that the course of events and the new interests
of henrietta s views should have placed her friend at all in favour
with any of the musgrove family she had only time however
for a general answer and a wish that such another woman
were at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceased
on seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards them 
they came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready
but louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had something
to procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the town 
they were all at her disposal

when they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentleman
at the same moment preparing to come down politely drew back
and stopped to give them way  they ascended and passed him
and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her
with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of 
she was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty features
having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind
which had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eye
which it had also produced  it was evident that the gentleman
completely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedingly 
captain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which
shewed his noticing of it  he gave her a momentary glance
a glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with you
and even i at this moment see something like anne elliot again

after attending louisa through her business and loitering about
a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards
quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against
the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment 
she had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves
and determined that a well looking groom who was strolling about
near the two inns as they came back should be his servant 
both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea
it was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves
and this second meeting short as it was also proved again
by the gentleman s looks that he thought hers very lovely
and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he was
a man of exceedingly good manners  he seemed about thirty
and though not handsome had an agreeable person  anne felt that
she should like to know who he was

they had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriage
almost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the party
to the window  it was a gentleman s carriage a curricle
but only coming round from the stable yard to the front door
somebody must be going away  it was driven by a servant in mourning

the word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he might
compare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne s curiosity
and the whole six were collected to look by the time the owner
of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows
and civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive off

ah cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anne
it is the very man we passed

the miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched him
as far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast table 
the waiter came into the room soon afterwards

pray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the name
of the gentleman who is just gone away

yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night
from sidmouth  dare say you heard the carriage sir while you were
at dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bath
and london

elliot  many had looked on each other and many had repeated the name
before all this had been got through even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter

bless me cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot
it must indeed  charles anne must not it  in mourning you see
just as our mr elliot must be  how very extraordinary 
in the very same inn with us  anne must not it be our mr elliot
my father s next heir  pray sir turning to the waiter
did not you hear did not his servant say whether he belonged
to the kellynch family

no ma am he did not mention no particular family but he said
his master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some day

there you see cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said 
heir to sir walter elliot  i was sure that would come out
if it was so  depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servants
take care to publish wherever he goes  but anne only conceive
how extraordinary  i wish i had looked at him more  i wish we had
been aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to us 
what a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other 
do you think he had the elliot countenance  i hardly looked at him
i was looking at the horses but i think he had something
of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me 
oh the great coat was hanging over the panel and hid the arms
so it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed them
and the livery too if the servant had not been in mourning
one should have known him by the livery

putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together
said captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangement
of providence that you should not be introduced to your cousin

when she could command mary s attention anne quietly tried
to convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many years
been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction
at all desirable

at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself
to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch
was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense 
she would not upon any account mention her having met with him
the second time luckily mary did not much attend to their having
passed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have felt
quite ill used by anne s having actually run against him in the passage
and received his very polite excuses while she had never been
near him at all no that cousinly little interview must remain
a perfect secret

of course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliot
the next time you write to bath  i think my father certainly
ought to hear of it do mention all about him

anne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstance
which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated
but as what ought to be suppressed  the offence which had been given
her father many years back she knew elizabeth s particular share in it
she suspected and that mr elliot s idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt  mary never wrote to bath herself all the toil
of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabeth
fell on anne

breakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captain
and mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointed
to take their last walk about lyme  they ought to be setting off
for uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all together
and out of doors as long as they could

anne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were all
fairly in the street  their conversation the preceding evening
did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together
some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron
and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers
to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something
occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of
captain benwick she had captain harville by her side

miss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much  i wish he could have
such company oftener  it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he is
but what can we do  we cannot part

no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible
but in time perhaps  we know what time does in every case of affliction
and you must remember captain harville that your friend
may yet be called a young mourner  only last summer i understand

ay true enough with a deep sigh only june

and not known to him perhaps so soon

not till the first week of august when he came home from the cape
just made into the grappler  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of him
he sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouth 
there the news must follow him but who was to tell it not i 
i would as soon have been run up to the yard arm  nobody could do it
but that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth  the laconia
had come into plymouth the week before no danger of her
being sent to sea again  he stood his chance for the rest
wrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the return
travelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed off
to the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a week 
that s what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james 
you may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us

anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as much
in reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemed
able to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subject
and when he spoke again it was of something totally different

mrs harville s giving it as her opinion that her husband would have
quite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the direction
of all the party in what was to be their last walk they would
accompany them to their door and then return and set off themselves 
by all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drew
near the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once more
all were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determined
that the difference of a quarter of an hour it was found
would be no difference at all so with all the kind leave taking
and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which
may be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harville
at their own door and still accompanied by captain benwick
who seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to make
the proper adieus to the cobb

anne found captain benwick again drawing near her  lord byron s
dark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward by
their present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as
attention was possible  it was soon drawn perforce another way

there was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasant
for the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower
and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight
excepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworth 
in all their walks he had had to jump her from the stiles
the sensation was delightful to her  the hardness of the pavement
for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion
he did it however  she was safely down and instantly
to show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down again 
he advised her against it thought the jar too great but no
he reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determined
i will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a second
she fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless 
there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closed
she breathed not her face was like death  the horror of the moment
to all who stood around

captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms
looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence 
she is dead she is dead screamed mary catching hold of her
husband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable
and in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction lost
her senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captain
benwick and anne who caught and supported her between them

is there no one to help me were the first words which
burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if
all his own strength were gone

go to him go to him cried anne for heaven s sake go to him 
i can support her myself  leave me and go to him  rub her hands
rub her temples here are salts take them take them

captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment
disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him
and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them
and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain
while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support
exclaimed in the bitterest agony  

oh god her father and mother

a surgeon said anne

he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only  
true true a surgeon this instant was darting away
when anne eagerly suggested  

captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwick 
he knows where a surgeon is to be found

every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea
and in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick had
resigned the poor corpse like  figure entirely to the brother s care
and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity

as to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be said
which of the three who were completely rational was suffering most 
captain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionate
brother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyes
from one sister to see the other in a state as insensible
or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on him
for help which he could not give

anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought
which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals
to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles
to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth  both seemed to look to her
for directions

anne anne cried charles what is to be done next 
what in heaven s name is to be done next

captain wentworth s eyes were also turned towards her

had not she better be carried to the inn  yes i am sure 
carry her gently to the inn

yes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparatively
collected and eager to be doing something  i will carry her myself 
musgrove take care of the others

by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them
to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of
a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine
as the first report  to some of the best looking of these good people
henrietta was consigned for though partially revived
she was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her side
and charles attending to his wife they set forward treading back
with feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very lately
and so light of heart they had passed along

they were not off the cobb before the harvilles met them 
captain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenance
which showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediately
informed and directed as they passed towards the spot 
shocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nerves
that could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wife
decided what was to be done  she must be taken to their house
all must go to their house and await the surgeon s arrival there 
they would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were all
beneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harville s direction
was conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bed
assistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husband
to all who needed them

louisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them again
without apparent consciousness  this had been a proof of life
however of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectly
incapable of being in the same room with louisa was kept
by the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibility 
mary too was growing calmer

the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible 
they were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopeless 
the head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuries
recovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfully

that he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not say
a few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of most
and the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silent
after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offered
may be conceived

the tone the look with which thank god was uttered
by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her
nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it
with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by
the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection
to calm them

louisa s limbs had escaped  there was no injury but to the head

it now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done
as to their general situation  they were now able to speak to each other
and consult  that louisa must remain where she was however distressing
to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble
did not admit a doubt  her removal was impossible  the harvilles
silenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitude 
they had looked forward and arranged everything before the others
began to reflect  captain benwick must give up his room to them
and get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settled 
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more
and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid s room
or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not
finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay
though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be
the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville s care entirely 
mrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery maid
who had lived with her long and gone about with her everywhere
was just such another  between these two she could want
no possible attendance by day or night  and all this was said
with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible

charles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultation
and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror 
uppercross the necessity of some one s going to uppercross
the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove
the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they
ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time 
at first they were capable of nothing more to the purpose
than such exclamations but after a while captain wentworth
exerting himself said  

we must be decided and without the loss of another minute 
every minute is valuable  some one must resolve on being off
for uppercross instantly  musgrove either you or i must go

charles agreed but declared his resolution of not going away 
he would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harville
but as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor would 
so far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the same 
she however was soon persuaded to think differently  the usefulness
of her staying  she who had not been able to remain in louisa s room
or to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless 
she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good
yet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thought
of her father and mother she gave it up she consented
she was anxious to be at home

the plan had reached this point when anne coming quietly
down from louisa s room could not but hear what followed
for the parlour door was open

then it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworth
that you stay and that i take care of your sister home 
but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville
i think it need be only one  mrs charles musgrove will of course
wish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so proper
so capable as anne

she paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself
so spoken of  the other two warmly agreed with what he said
and she then appeared

you will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried he
turning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentleness
which seemed almost restoring the past  she coloured deeply
and he recollected himself and moved away  she expressed herself
most willing ready happy to remain  it was what she had been
thinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  a bed on the floor
in louisa s room would be sufficient for her if mrs harville
would but think so

one thing more and all seemed arranged  though it was rather desirable
that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses
to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense
and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed
that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn
and leave mr musgrove s carriage and horses to be sent home
the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage
of sending an account of louisa s night

captain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part
and to be soon followed by the two ladies  when the plan was
made known to mary however there was an end of all peace in it 
she was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injustice
in being expected to go away instead of anne anne who was
nothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best right
to stay in henrietta s stead  why was not she to be as useful as anne 
and to go home without charles too without her husband 
no it was too unkind  and in short she said more than her husband
could long withstand and as none of the others could oppose
when he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for anne
was inevitable

anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous
and ill judging claims of mary but so it must be and they set off
for the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwick
attending to her  she gave a moment s recollection as they hurried along
to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed
earlier in the morning  there she had listened to henrietta s schemes
for dr shirley s leaving uppercross farther on she had
first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given
to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare

captain benwick was most considerately attentive to her and
united as they all seemed by the distress of the day she felt
an increasing degree of good will towards him and a pleasure even
in thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuing
their acquaintance

captain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waiting
stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street
but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister
for the other the change in his countenance the astonishment
the expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened to
made but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince her
that she was valued only as she could be useful to louisa

she endeavoured to be composed and to be just  without emulating
the feelings of an emma towards her henry she would have
attended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard
for his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjust
as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend

in the mean while she was in the carriage  he had handed them both in
and placed himself between them and in this manner under these
circumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lyme 
how the long stage would pass how it was to affect their manners
what was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foresee 
it was all quite natural however  he was devoted to henrietta
always turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the view
of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  in general
his voice and manner were studiously calm  to spare henrietta
from agitation seemed the governing principle  once only
when she had been grieving over the last ill judged ill fated
walk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of
he burst forth as if wholly overcome  

don t talk of it don t talk of it he cried  oh god that i had
not given way to her at the fatal moment  had i done as i ought 
but so eager and so resolute dear sweet louisa

anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justness
of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage
of firmness of character and whether it might not strike him that
like all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportions
and limits  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel
that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness
as a very resolute character

they got on fast  anne was astonished to recognise the same hills
and the same objects so soon  their actual speed heightened by
some dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as long
as on the day before  it was growing quite dusk however
before they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had been
total silence among them for some time henrietta leaning back
in the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of her
having cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hill
anne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworth 
in a low cautious voice he said   

i have been considering what we had best do  she must not
appear at first  she could not stand it  i have been thinking whether
you had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go in
and break it to mr and mrs musgrove  do you think this is a good plan

she did  he was satisfied and said no more  but the remembrance
of the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendship
and of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it became
a sort of parting proof its value did not lessen

when the distressing communication at uppercross was over
and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped
and the daughter all the better for being with them he announced
his intention of returning in the same carriage to lyme
and when the horses were baited he was off

end of volume one



chapter 13


the remainder of anne s time at uppercross comprehending only two days
was spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfaction
of knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companion
and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future which
in mr and mrs musgrove s distressed state of spirits would have
been difficulties

they had an early account from lyme the next morning  louisa was
much the same  no symptoms worse than before had appeared 
charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and
more particular account  he was tolerably cheerful  a speedy cure
must not be hoped but everything was going on as well
as the nature of the case admitted  in speaking of the harvilles
he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness
especially of mrs harville s exertions as a nurse  she really left
nothing for mary to do  he and mary had been persuaded to go early
to their inn last night  mary had been hysterical again this morning 
when he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwick
which he hoped would do her good  he almost wished she had been
prevailed on to come home the day before but the truth was
that mrs harville left nothing for anybody to do

charles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his father
had at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consent 
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others
and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed
and was acted upon  a chaise was sent for from crewkherne
and charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery maid
of the family one who having brought up all the children
and seen the very last the lingering and long petted master harry
sent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nursery
to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could
get near her and who consequently was only too happy in being
allowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa  vague wishes of
getting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henrietta
but without anne it would hardly have been resolved on
and found practicable so soon

they were indebted the next day to charles hayter for all
the minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtain
every twenty four hours  he made it his business to go to lyme
and his account was still encouraging  the intervals of sense
and consciousness were believed to be stronger  every report agreed
in captain wentworth s appearing fixed in lyme

anne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreaded 
what should they do without her  they were wretched comforters
for one another  and so much was said in this way that anne thought
she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination
to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once 
she had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would go
go to morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgings
as it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be moved 
they must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with
they might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own children
and in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delighted
with what she had done and felt that she could not spend her
last morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparations
and sending them off at an early hour though her being left
to the solitary range of the house was the consequence

she was the last excepting the little boys at the cottage
she was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filled
and animated both houses of all that had given uppercross
its cheerful character  a few days had made a change indeed

if louisa recovered it would all be well again  more than
former happiness would be restored  there could not be a doubt
to her mind there was none of what would follow her recovery 
a few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but by
her silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happy
and gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love
all that was most unlike anne elliot

an hour s complete leisure for such reflections as these
on a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting out
the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enough
to make the sound of lady russell s carriage exceedingly welcome
and yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion house
or look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping and
comfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glasses
the last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heart 
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious 
it stood the record of many sensations of pain once severe
but now softened and of some instances of relenting feeling
some breathings of friendship and reconciliation which could
never be looked for again and which could never cease to be dear 
she left it all behind her all but the recollection that
such things had been

anne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell s house
in september  it had not been necessary and the few occasions of
its being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evade
and escape from  her first return was to resume her place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes
of its mistress

there was some anxiety mixed with lady russell s joy in meeting her 
she knew who had been frequenting uppercross  but happily
either anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russell
fancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasion
had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration
of her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed with
a second spring of youth and beauty

when they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental change 
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch
and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother
among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest 
she had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and bath 
their concerns had been sunk under those of uppercross
and when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fears
and spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden place
which had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should still
be with them anne would have been ashamed to have it known
how much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgrove
and all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to her
was the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwick
than her own father s house in camden place or her own sister s intimacy
with mrs clay  she was actually forced to exert herself
to meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude
on topics which had by nature the first claim on her

there was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse
on another subject  they must speak of the accident at lyme 
lady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before
when a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it must
be talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudence
lament the result and captain wentworth s name must be mentioned by both 
anne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russell 
she could not speak the name and look straight forward to
lady russell s eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling her
briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisa 
when this was told his name distressed her no longer

lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy
but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt
that the man who at twenty three had seemed to understand somewhat
of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards
be charmed by a louisa musgrove

the first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lyme
which found their way to anne she could not tell how and brought
a rather improving account of louisa  at the end of that period
lady russell s politeness could repose no longer and the fainter
self threatenings of the past became in a decided tone
i must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soon 
anne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that house 
it will be some trial to us both

anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said
in observing  

i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two
your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine 
by remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to it

she could have said more on the subject for she had in fact
so high an opinion of the crofts and considered her father
so very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sure
of a good example and the poor of the best attention and relief
that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal
she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone
who deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passed
into better hands than its owners  these convictions must unquestionably
have their own pain and severe was its kind but they precluded
that pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house again
and returning through the well known apartments

in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself
these rooms ought to belong only to us  oh how fallen
in their destination  how unworthily occupied  an ancient family
to be so driven away  strangers filling their place 
no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where
she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description
to heave

mrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure
of fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasion
receiving her in that house there was particular attention

the sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topic
and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appeared
that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn
that captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first time
since the accident had brought anne the last note which she had
not been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hours
and then returned again to lyme and without any present intention
of quitting it any more  he had enquired after her she found
particularly had expressed his hope of miss elliot s not being
the worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as great 
this was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else
could have done

as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style
by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work
on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been
the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence
that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think
how long miss musgrove s recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable
she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter 
the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming  

ay a very bad business indeed  a new sort of way this
for a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress s head
is not it miss elliot  this is breaking a head and giving a plaster
truly

admiral croft s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell
but they delighted anne  his goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible

now this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing from
a little reverie to be coming and finding us here  i had not
recollected it before i declare but it must be very bad 
but now do not stand upon ceremony  get up and go over all the rooms
in the house if you like it

another time sir i thank you not now

well whenever it suits you  you can slip in from the shrubbery
at any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up
by that door  a good place is not it  but checking himself
you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept
in the butler s room  ay so it always is i believe 
one man s ways may be as good as another s but we all like our own best 
and so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for you
to go about the house or not

anne finding she might decline it did so very gratefully

we have made very few changes either continued the admiral
after thinking a moment  very few  we told you about the laundry door
at uppercross  that has been a very great improvement 
the wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience
of its opening as it did so long  you will tell sir walter
what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement
the house ever had  indeed i must do ourselves the justice to say
that the few alterations we have made have been all very much
for the better  my wife should have the credit of them however 
i have done very little besides sending away some of the large
looking glasses from my dressing room which was your father s 
a very good man and very much the gentleman i am sure 
but i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflection
i should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life 
such a number of looking glasses oh lord there was no getting away
from one s self  so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soon
shifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with my
little shaving glass in one corner and another great thing
that i never go near

anne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answer
and the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enough
took up the subject again to say  

the next time you write to your good father miss elliot
pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s and say that we are
settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find
with the place  the breakfast room chimney smokes a little
i grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard
which may not happen three times a winter  and take it altogether
now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge
there is not one that we like better than this  pray say so
with my compliments  he will be glad to hear it

lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other 
but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed
far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced
themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions
in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again
before lady russell would be removing to bath

so ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hall
or of seeing him in company with her friend  everything was safe enough
and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted
on the subject



chapter 14


though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer after
mr and mrs musgrove s going than anne conceived they could have been
at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again
and as soon as possible after their return to uppercross
they drove over to the lodge  they had left louisa beginning to sit up
but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves
susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though
she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well
it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear
the removal home and her father and mother who must return
in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays
had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them

they had been all in lodgings together  mrs musgrove had
got mrs harville s children away as much as she could every possible
supply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenience
to the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting them
to come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have been
only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested
and hospitable

mary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evident
by her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffer 
charles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and when
they dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid servant to wait
and at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedence
but then she had received so very handsome an apology from her
on finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so much
going on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgings
and the harvilles and she had got books from the library
and changed them so often that the balance had certainly been
much in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth too
and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many
more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross
and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful
had made really an agreeable fortnight

anne enquired after captain benwick mary s face was clouded directly 
charles laughed

oh captain benwick is very well i believe but he is
a very odd young man  i do not know what he would be at 
we asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertook
to give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my part
i thought it was all settled when behold on tuesday night
he made a very awkward sort of excuse he never shot and he had
been quite misunderstood and he had promised this and he had
promised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to come 
i suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my word
i should have thought we were lively enough at the cottage
for such a heart broken man as captain benwick

charles laughed again and said now mary you know very well
how it really was  it was all your doing turning to anne 
he fancied that if he went with us he should find you close by 
he fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discovered
that lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed him
and he had not courage to come  that is the fact upon my honour
mary knows it is

but mary did not give into it very graciously whether from
not considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situation
to be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believe
anne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must be
left to be guessed  anne s good will however was not to be lessened
by what she heard  she boldly acknowledged herself flattered
and continued her enquiries

oh he talks of you cried charles in such terms   
mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard him
mention anne twice all the time i was there  i declare anne
he never talks of you at all

no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general
way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly 
his head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation
and he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or other
in one of them which he thinks   oh i cannot pretend to remember it
but it was something very fine  i overheard him telling henrietta
all about it and then miss elliot was spoken of in the highest terms 
now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you were
in the other room  elegance sweetness beauty oh there was no end
of miss elliot s charms

and i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his credit
if he did  miss harville only died last june  such a heart
is very little worth having is it lady russell  i am sure
you will agree with me

i must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smiling

and that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma am
said charles  though he had not nerves for coming away with us
and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here
he will make his way over to kellynch one day by himself
you may depend on it  i told him the distance and the road
and i told him of the church s being so very well worth seeing
for as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that would
be a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and soul
and i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon 
so i give you notice lady russell

any acquaintance of anne s will always be welcome to me
was lady russell s kind answer

oh as to being anne s acquaintance said mary i think he is rather
my acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnight

well as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happy
to see captain benwick

you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am 
he is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  he has walked with me
sometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a word 
he is not at all a well bred young man  i am sure you will not like him

there we differ mary said anne  i think lady russell would like him 
i think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she would
very soon see no deficiency in his manner

so do i anne said charles  i am sure lady russell would like him 
he is just lady russell s sort  give him a book and he will
read all day long

yes that he will exclaimed mary tauntingly  he will sit poring
over his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when one
drop s one s scissors or anything that happens  do you think
lady russell would like that

lady russell could not help laughing  upon my word said she
i should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have
admitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of fact
as i may call myself  i have really a curiosity to see the person
who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions 
i wish he may be induced to call here  and when he does mary
you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined
not to judge him beforehand

you will not like him i will answer for it

lady russell began talking of something else  mary spoke with animation
of their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarily

he is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to see 
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family
has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me

this decision checked mary s eagerness and stopped her short
in the midst of the elliot countenance

with regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiries
there was voluntary communication sufficient  his spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected  as louisa improved
he had improved and he was now quite a different creature
from what he had been the first week  he had not seen louisa
and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her
from an interview that he did not press for it at all and
on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week
or ten days till her head was stronger  he had talked of going
down to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwick
to go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwick
seemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynch

there can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were both
occasionally thinking of captain benwick from this time 
lady russell could not hear the door bell without feeling that it might
be his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence
in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village
without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him 
captain benwick came not however  he was either less disposed for it
than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him
a week s indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy
of the interest which he had been beginning to excite

the musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school
bringing with them mrs harville s little children to improve the noise
of uppercross and lessen that of lyme  henrietta remained with louisa
but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters

lady russell and anne paid their compliments to them once
when anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive again 
though neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayter
nor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrast
as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in

immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles
whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children
from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  on one side
was a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silk
and gold paper and on the other were tressels and trays
bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boys
were holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas fire
which seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noise
of the others  charles and mary also came in of course
during their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respects
to lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutes
talking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the children
on his knees generally in vain  it was a fine family piece

anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed
such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves
which louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken  but mrs musgrove
who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially
again and again for all her attentions to them concluded
a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing
with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through
nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness
at home

louisa was now recovering apace  her mother could even think of her
being able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisters
went to school again  the harvilles had promised to come with her
and stay at uppercross whenever she returned  captain wentworth was gone
for the present to see his brother in shropshire

i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross
in the christmas holidays

everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters
and sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sort
rather than their quantity  when lady russell not long afterwards
was entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving through
the long course of streets from the old bridge to camden place
amidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and drays
the bawling of newspapermen muffin men and milkmen and the ceaseless
clink of pattens she made no complaint  no these were noises
which belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits rose
under their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feeling
though not saying that after being long in the country nothing could be
so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness

anne did not share these feelings  she persisted in a very determined
though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish
of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be
however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her
when she arrived  and looked back with fond regret to the bustles
of uppercross and the seclusion of kellynch

elizabeth s last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest 
mr elliot was in bath  he had called in camden place had called
a second time a third had been pointedly attentive  if elizabeth
and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains
to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection
as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  this was very wonderful
if it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeable
curiosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentiment
she had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she had
no wish to see  she had a great wish to see him  if he really sought
to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgiven
for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree

anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance
but she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than not
which was more than she could say for many other persons in bath

she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove
to her own lodgings in rivers street



chapter 15


sir walter had taken a very good house in camden place
a lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequence
and both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfaction

anne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonment
of many months and anxiously saying to herself oh when shall i
leave you again  a degree of unexpected cordiality however
in the welcome she received did her good  her father and sister
were glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture
and met her with kindness  her making a fourth when they
sat down to dinner was noticed as an advantage

mrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smiles
were more a matter of course  anne had always felt that she would
pretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the others
was unlooked for  they were evidently in excellent spirits
and she was soon to listen to the causes  they had no inclination
to listen to her  after laying out for some compliments of being
deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not pay
they had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must be
all their own  uppercross excited no interest kellynch very little 
it was all bath

they had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect  their house was undoubtedly
the best in camden place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of
and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting up
or the taste of the furniture  their acquaintance was
exceedingly sought after  everybody was wanting to visit them 
they had drawn back from many introductions and still were
perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing

here were funds of enjoyment  could anne wonder that her father
and sister were happy  she might not wonder but she must sigh
that her father should feel no degradation in his change should see
nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder
should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town
and she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw open
the folding doors and walked with exultation from one drawing room
to the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that woman
who had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud of
between two walls perhaps thirty feet asunder

but this was not all which they had to make them happy 
they had mr elliot too  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliot 
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him 
he had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bath
in november in his way to london when the intelligence of
sir walter s being settled there had of course reached him
though only twenty four hours in the place but he had not been able
to avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bath
and his first object on arriving had been to leave his card
in camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet
and when they did meet by such great openness of conduct
such readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be received
as a relation again that their former good understanding
was completely re established

they had not a fault to find in him  he had explained away
all the appearance of neglect on his own side  it had originated
in misapprehension entirely  he had never had an idea of
throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off
but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  upon the hint
of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family
and the family honours he was quite indignant  he who had ever boasted
of being an elliot and whose feelings as to connection
were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day 
he was astonished indeed but his character and general conduct
must refute it  he could refer sir walter to all who knew him
and certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunity
of reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relation
and heir presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject

the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of
much extenuation  this was an article not to be entered on by himself
but a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highly
respectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill looking man
sir walter added who was living in very good style in marlborough
buildings and had at his own particular request been admitted
to their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two things
relative to the marriage which made a material difference
in the discredit of it

colonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquainted
also with his wife had perfectly understood the whole story 
she was certainly not a woman of family but well educated
accomplished rich and excessively in love with his friend 
there had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attraction
not all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter was
moreover assured of her having been a very fine woman 
here was a great deal to soften the business  a very fine woman
with a large fortune in love with him  sir walter seemed to admit it
as complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstance
in quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuation

mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once
evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they
gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof
of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being
on intimate terms in camden place

anne listened but without quite understanding it  allowances
large allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spoke 
she heard it all under embellishment  all that sounded extravagant
or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators  still however she had
the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared
in mr elliot s wishing after an interval of so many years
to be well received by them  in a worldly view he had nothing to gain
by being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variance 
in all probability he was already the richer of the two
and the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title 
a sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible man
why should it be an object to him  she could only offer one solution
it was perhaps for elizabeth s sake  there might really have been
a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him
a different way and now that he could afford to please himself
he might mean to pay his addresses to her  elizabeth was certainly
very handsome with well bred elegant manners and her character
might never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in public
and when very young himself  how her temper and understanding
might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life
was another concern and rather a fearful one  most earnestly did she wish
that he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabeth
were his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself so
and that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparent
by a glance or two between them while mr elliot s frequent visits
were talked of

anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but without
being much attended to  oh yes perhaps it had been mr elliot 
they did not know  it might be him perhaps  they could not listen
to her description of him  they were describing him themselves
sir walter especially  he did justice to his very gentlemanlike
appearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped face
his sensible eye but at the same time must lament his being
very much under hung a defect which time seemed to have increased
nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered
almost every feature for the worse  mr elliot appeared to think
that he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done when
they last parted but sir walter had not been able to return
the compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  he did not mean
to complain however  mr elliot was better to look at than most men
and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere

mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of
the whole evening  colonel wallis had been so impatient to be
introduced to them and mr elliot so anxious that he should
and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by description
as she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliot
spoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being known
in camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted 
sir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to be
an excessively pretty woman beautiful  he longed to see her 
he hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces
he was continually passing in the streets  the worst of bath was
the number of its plain women  he did not mean to say that there were
no pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportion 
he had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome face
would be followed by thirty or five and thirty frights and once
as he had stood in a shop on bond street he had counted
eighty seven women go by one after another without there being
a tolerable face among them  it had been a frosty morning
to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand
could stand the test of  but still there certainly were
a dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men
they were infinitely worse  such scarecrows as the streets were full of 
it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced 
he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis
who was a fine military figure though sandy haired without observing
that every woman s eye was upon him every woman s eye was sure to be
upon colonel wallis  modest sir walter  he was not allowed
to escape however  his daughter and mrs clay united in hinting
that colonel wallis s companion might have as good a figure
as colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy haired

how is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humour 
the last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may not
happen every day

oh no that must have been quite accidental  in general she has been
in very good health and very good looks since michaelmas

if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds
and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse

anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown
or a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the door
suspended everything  a knock at the door and so late 
it was ten o clock  could it be mr elliot  they knew he was to dine
in lansdown crescent  it was possible that he might stop in his way home
to ask them how they did  they could think of no one else 
mrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot s knock  mrs clay was right 
with all the state which a butler and foot boy could give
mr elliot was ushered into the room

it was the same the very same man with no difference but of dress 
anne drew a little back while the others received his compliments
and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour
but he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she
nor her friend had taken cold the day before  c  c which was
all as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her part
must follow then  sir walter talked of his youngest daughter
mr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter
there was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling and
blushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty features
which he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusement
at his little start of surprise that he had not been at all aware
of who she was  he looked completely astonished but not more astonished
than pleased his eyes brightened and with the most perfect alacrity
he welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreated
to be received as an acquaintance already  he was quite as good looking
as he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speaking
and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polished
so easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare them
in excellence to only one person s manners  they were not the same
but they were perhaps equally good

he sat down with them and improved their conversation very much 
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  ten minutes
were enough to certify that  his tone his expressions
his choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was all
the operation of a sensible discerning mind  as soon as he could
he began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinions
respecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance
of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time
to give his own route understand something of hers and regret that
he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her 
she gave him a short account of her party and business at lyme 
his regret increased as he listened  he had spent his whole
solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voices
mirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of people
longed to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicion
of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself 
if he had but asked who the party were  the name of musgrove would
have told him enough  well it would serve to cure him of
an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn
which he had adopted when quite a young man on the principal
of its being very ungenteel to be curious

the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he
as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing
are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings
in the world  the folly of the means they often employ
is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view

but he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alone 
he knew it he was soon diffused again among the others
and it was only at intervals that he could return to lyme

his enquiries however produced at length an account of the scene
she had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the place 
having alluded to an accident  he must hear the whole 
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also
but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt 
she could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wish
of really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concern
for what she must have suffered in witnessing it

he staid an hour with them  the elegant little clock on the mantel 
piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchman
was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale
before mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long

anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in
camden place could have passed so well



chapter 16


there was one point which anne on returning to her family
would have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot s
being in love with elizabeth which was her father s not being
in love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about it
when she had been at home a few hours  on going down to breakfast
the next morning she found there had just been a decent pretence
on the lady s side of meaning to leave them  she could imagine mrs clay
to have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herself
at all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper
that must not be any reason indeed  i assure you i feel it none 
she is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full time
to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be  as yet
you have seen nothing of bath  you have been here only to be useful 
you must not run away from us now  you must stay to be acquainted
with mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis  to your fine mind
i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification

he spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprised
to see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herself 
her countenance perhaps might express some watchfulness
but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought
in her sister  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties
and promise to stay

in the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to be
alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks
he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin
her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  had she been
using any thing in particular  no nothing  merely gowland
he supposed  no nothing at all  ha he was surprised at that
and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are 
you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland
the constant use of gowland during the spring months  mrs clay has been
using it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for her 
you see how it has carried away her freckles

if elizabeth could but have heard this  such personal praise
might have struck her especially as it did not appear to anne
that the freckles were at all lessened  but everything must
take its chance  the evil of a marriage would be much diminished
if elizabeth were also to marry  as for herself she might always
command a home with lady russell

lady russell s composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point in her intercourse in camden place  the sight of mrs clay
in such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation
to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bath
who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has
a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed

as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable
or more indifferent towards the others  his manners were
an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found
the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first
as she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliot
and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable
or estimable man  everything united in him good understanding
correct opinions knowledge of the world and a warm heart 
he had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour
without pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune
without display he judged for himself in everything essential
without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum 
he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits
or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet
with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value
for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of
fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess 
she was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  colonel wallis
said it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappiness
to sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent his
thinking of a second choice  her satisfaction in mr elliot
outweighed all the plague of mrs clay

it was now some years since anne had begun to learn that she
and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently
and it did not surprise her therefore that lady russell
should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require
more motives than appeared in mr elliot s great desire of a reconciliation 
in lady russell s view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot
at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object
and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people
to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process
in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring
in the heyday of youth  anne presumed however still to smile about it
and at last to mention elizabeth  lady russell listened and looked
and made only this cautious reply   elizabeth very well
time will explain

it was a reference to the future which anne after a little observation
felt she must submit to  she could determine nothing at present 
in that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habit
of such general observance as miss elliot that any particularity
of attention seemed almost impossible  mr elliot too
it must be remembered had not been a widower seven months 
a little delay on his side might be very excusable  in fact
anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that
she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations
for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed
so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery
from the awful impression of its being dissolved

however it might end he was without any question their
pleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to him
and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme
which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of
as herself  they went through the particulars of their first meeting
a great many times  he gave her to understand that he had
looked at her with some earnestness  she knew it well
and she remembered another person s look also

they did not always think alike  his value for rank and connexion
she perceived was greater than hers  it was not merely complaisance
it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly
into her father and sister s solicitudes on a subject which
she thought unworthy to excite them  the bath paper one morning
announced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrymple
and her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfort
of no    camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymples
in anne s opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliots
and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly

anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility
and she must acknowledge herself disappointed  she had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life
and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen
a wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrymple
and miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her ears
all day long

sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount
but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties
of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse
by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount
when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter s
at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch 
no letter of condolence had been sent to ireland  the neglect
had been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliot
died herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynch
and consequently there was but too much reason to apprehend
that the dalrymples considered the relationship as closed 
how to have this anxious business set to rights and be admitted
as cousins again was the question  and it was a question which
in a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliot
thought unimportant  family connexions were always worth preserving
good company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a house
for three months in laura place and would be living in style 
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her
spoken of as a charming woman  it was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed if it could be done without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the elliots

sir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrote
a very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreaty
to his right honourable cousin  neither lady russell nor mr elliot
could admire the letter but it did all that was wanted
in bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountess 
she was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintance 
the toils of the business were over the sweets began  they visited
in laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrymple
and the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they might
be most visible  and our cousins in laura place  our cousin
lady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybody

anne was ashamed  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even been
very agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitation
they created but they were nothing  there was no superiority of manner
accomplishment or understanding  lady dalrymple had acquired
the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer
for everybody  miss carteret with still less to say was so plain
and so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden place
but for her birth

lady russell confessed she had expected something better but yet
it was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speak
her opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothing
in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion
as good company as those who would collect good company around them
they had their value  anne smiled and said 

my idea of good company mr elliot is the company of clever
well informed people who have a great deal of conversation
that is what i call good company

you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company
that is the best  good company requires only birth education
and manners and with regard to education is not very nice 
birth and good manners are essential but a little learning is
by no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contrary
it will do very well  my cousin anne shakes her head 
she is not satisfied  she is fastidious  my dear cousin
sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious
than almost any other woman i know but will it answer 
will it make you happy  will it not be wiser to accept the society
of those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantages
of the connexion as far as possible  you may depend upon it
that they will move in the first set in bath this winter
and as rank is rank your being known to be related to them
will have its use in fixing your family our family let me say
in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for

yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them 
then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added
i certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken
to procure the acquaintance  i suppose smiling i have more pride
than any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should be
so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we may
be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them

pardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claims 
in london perhaps in your present quiet style of living
it might be as you say  but in bath sir walter elliot and his family
will always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintance

well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place

i love your indignation said he it is very natural 
but here you are in bath and the object is to be established here
with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliot 
you talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wish
to believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigated
would have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seem
a little different  in one point i am sure my dear cousin
he continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the room
in one point i am sure we must feel alike  we must feel that
every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors
may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him

he looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had been
lately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant
and though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride
she was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscience
admitted that his wishing to promote her father s getting
great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her



chapter 17


while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing their
good fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintance
of a very different description

she had called on her former governess and had heard from her
of there being an old school fellow in bath who had the two strong claims
on her attention of past kindness and present suffering  miss hamilton
now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life
when it had been most valuable  anne had gone unhappy to school
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved
feeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteen
of strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a time
and miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the want
of near relations and a settled home remaining another year at school
had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened
her misery and could never be remembered with indifference

miss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwards
was said to have married a man of fortune and this was all
that anne had known of her till now that their governess s account
brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form

she was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravagant
and at his death about two years before had left his affairs
dreadfully involved  she had had difficulties of every sort
to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted
with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs
had made her for the present a cripple  she had come to bath
on that account and was now in lodgings near the hot baths
living in a very humble way unable even to afford herself
the comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from society

their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit
from miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne therefore
lost no time in going  she mentioned nothing of what she had heard
or what she intended at home  it would excite no proper interest there 
she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments
and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith s lodgings
in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken

the visit was paid their acquaintance re established their interest
in each other more than re kindled  the first ten minutes
had its awkwardness and its emotion  twelve years were gone
since they had parted and each presented a somewhat different person
from what the other had imagined  twelve years had changed anne
from the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegant
little woman of seven and twenty with every beauty except bloom
and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle
and twelve years had transformed the fine looking well grown miss hamilton
in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poor
infirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegee
as a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon
passed away and left only the interesting charm of remembering
former partialities and talking over old times

anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which
she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse
and be cheerful beyond her expectation  neither the dissipations
of the past  and she had lived very much in the world  nor the restrictions
of the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have
closed her heart or ruined her spirits

in the course of a second visit she talked with great openness
and anne s astonishment increased  she could scarcely imagine
a more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith s  she had been
very fond of her husband  she had buried him  she had been
used to affluence  it was gone  she had no child to connect her
with life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangement
of perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportable 
her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroom
behind with no possibility of moving from one to the other without
assistance which there was only one servant in the house to afford
and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath 
yet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she had
moments only of languor and depression to hours of occupation
and enjoyment  how could it be  she watched observed reflected
and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude
or of resignation only  a submissive spirit might be patient
a strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something more
here was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comforted
that power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employment
which carried her out of herself which was from nature alone 
it was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friend
as one of those instances in which by a merciful appointment
it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want

there had been a time mrs smith told her when her spirits
had nearly failed  she could not call herself an invalid now
compared with her state on first reaching bath  then she had indeed
been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey
and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again
confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain
and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having
a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit
to meet any extraordinary expense  she had weathered it however
and could truly say that it had done her good  it had increased
her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands 
she had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterested
attachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landlady
had a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had been
particularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landlady
a nurse by profession and who had always a home in that house
when unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her 
and she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirably
has really proved an invaluable acquaintance  as soon as i could
use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement
and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases
pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about
and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood 
she had a large acquaintance of course professionally among those
who can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandize 
she always takes the right time for applying  everybody s heart is open
you know when they have recently escaped from severe pain
or are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rooke
thoroughly understands when to speak  she is a shrewd intelligent
sensible woman  hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has
a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her
infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received
the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to 
call it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour s
leisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relate
that is entertaining and profitable  something that makes one
know one s species better  one likes to hear what is going on
to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly 
to me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treat

anne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure replied
i can easily believe it  women of that class have great opportunities
and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to 
such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing 
and it is not merely in its follies that they are well read
for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be
most interesting or affecting  what instances must pass before them
of ardent disinterested self denying attachment of heroism fortitude
patience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most  a sick chamber may often furnish
the worth of volumes

yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may
though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe 
here and there human nature may be great in times of trial
but generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strength
that appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatience
rather than generosity and fortitude that one hears of 
there is so little real friendship in the world and unfortunately
speaking low and tremulously there are so many who forget
to think seriously till it is almost too late

anne saw the misery of such feelings  the husband had not been
what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind
which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved 
it was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it off
and soon added in a different tone  

i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at present
will furnish much either to interest or edify me  she is only nursing
mrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensive
fashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis however 
she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all
the high priced things i have in hand now

anne had called several times on her friend before the existence
of such a person was known in camden place  at last it became necessary
to speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morning
from laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymple
for the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that evening
in westgate buildings  she was not sorry for the excuse 
they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being
kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship
which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account
with great alacrity  she was engaged to spend the evening
with an old schoolfellow  they were not much interested in anything
relative to anne but still there were questions enough asked
to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabeth
was disdainful and sir walter severe

westgate buildings said he and who is miss anne elliot
to be visiting in westgate buildings  a mrs smith  a widow mrs smith
and who was her husband  one of five thousand mr smiths whose names
are to be met with everywhere  and what is her attraction 
that she is old and sickly  upon my word miss anne elliot
you have the most extraordinary taste  everything that revolts
other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations
are inviting to you  but surely you may put off this old lady
till to morrow  she is not so near her end i presume
but that she may hope to see another day  what is her age  forty

no sir she is not one and thirty but i do not think i can
put off my engagement because it is the only evening for some time
which will at once suit her and myself  she goes into the warm bath
to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged

but what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabeth

she sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contrary
she approves it and has generally taken me when i have
called on mrs smith

westgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir walter 
sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms
but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known
to convey a miss elliot  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings 
a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and forty
a mere mrs smith an every day mrs smith of all people and all names
in the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliot
and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility
of england and ireland  mrs smith  such a name

mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it
advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much
and did long to say a little in defense of her friend s
not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect
to her father prevented her  she made no reply  she left it
to himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widow
in bath between thirty and forty with little to live on
and no sirname of dignity

anne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of course
she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening 
she had been the only one of the set absent for sir walter
and elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship s service themselves
but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others
and had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliot
and mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis early
and lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements
in order to wait on her  anne had the whole history of all that
such an evening could supply from lady russell  to her
its greatest interest must be in having been very much talked of
between her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regretted
and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause 
her kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow
sick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliot 
he thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper manners
mind a model of female excellence  he could meet even lady russell
in a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understand
so much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly rated
by a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensations
which her friend meant to create

lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot 
she was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as of
his deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks
which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood
and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing 
she would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subject
she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter
of a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliance
supposing such attachment to be real and returned  anne heard her
and made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushed
and gently shook her head

i am no match maker as you well know said lady russell
being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events
and calculations  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence
pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him
i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together 
a most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i think
it might be a very happy one

mr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respects
i think highly of him said anne but we should not suit

lady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own that
to be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynch
the future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupying
your dear mother s place succeeding to all her rights
and all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would be
the highest possible gratification to me  you are your mother s self
in countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy you
such as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessing
in the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued 
my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt
at my time of life

anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant table
and leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited  for a few moments her imagination and her heart
were bewitched  the idea of becoming what her mother had been
of having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herself
of being restored to kellynch calling it her home again
her home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resist 
lady russell said not another word willing to leave the matter
to its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that moment
with propriety have spoken for himself  she believed in short
what anne did not believe  the same image of mr elliot speaking
for himself brought anne to composure again  the charm of kellynch
and of lady elliot all faded away  she never could accept him 
and it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man
save one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilities
of such a case was against mr elliot

though they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfied
that she really knew his character  that he was a sensible man
an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions
seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all
clear enough  he certainly knew what was right nor could she fix
on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she would
have been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrusted the past
if not the present  the names which occasionally dropt
of former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuits
suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been 
she saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travelling
had been a common thing that there had been a period of his life
and probably not a short one when he had been at least
careless in all serious matters and though he might now think
very differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever
cautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair character 
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed

mr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not open 
there was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delight
at the evil or good of others  this to anne was a decided imperfection 
her early impressions were incurable  she prized the frank
the open hearted the eager character beyond all others 
warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  she felt that she could
so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked
or said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mind
never varied whose tongue never slipped

mr elliot was too generally agreeable  various as were the tempers
in her father s house he pleased them all  he endured too well
stood too well with every body  he had spoken to her with some
degree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to see
what mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yet
mrs clay found him as agreeable as any body

lady russell saw either less or more than her young friend
for she saw nothing to excite distrust  she could not imagine
a man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did she
ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive
the hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course of
the following autumn



chapter 18


it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath
was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme 
she wanted to hear much more than mary had communicated 
it was three weeks since she had heard at all  she only knew
that henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to be
recovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them all
very intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from mary
was delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprise
with admiral and mrs croft s compliments

the crofts must be in bath  a circumstance to interest her 
they were people whom her heart turned to very naturally

what is this cried sir walter  the crofts have arrived in bath 
the crofts who rent kellynch  what have they brought you

a letter from uppercross cottage sir

oh those letters are convenient passports  they secure an introduction 
i should have visited admiral croft however at any rate 
i know what is due to my tenant

anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how
the poor admiral s complexion escaped her letter engrossed her 
it had been begun several days back


			  february 1st

my dear anne  i make no apology for my silence because i know
how little people think of letters in such a place as bath 
you must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross which
as you well know affords little to write about  we have had
a very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner party
all the holidays  i do not reckon the hayters as anybody 
the holidays however are over at last  i believe no children ever had
such long ones  i am sure i had not  the house was cleared yesterday
except of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hear
they have never gone home  mrs harville must be an odd mother
to part with them so long  i do not understand it  they are
not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to
like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren 
what dreadful weather we have had  it may not be felt in bath
with your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequence 
i have not had a creature call on me since the second week in january
except charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcome 
between ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lyme
as long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his way 
the carriage is gone to day to bring louisa and the harvilles to morrow 
we are not asked to dine with them however till the day after
mrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey
which is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of her
and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to morrow 
i am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquainted
with him too but i have my usual luck  i am always out of the way
when any thing desirable is going on always the last of my family
to be noticed  what an immense time mrs clay has been staying
with elizabeth  does she never mean to go away  but perhaps
if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited 
let me know what you think of this  i do not expect my children
to be asked you know  i can leave them at the great house very well
for a month or six weeks  i have this moment heard that the crofts
are going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral gouty 
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility
to give me any notice or of offering to take anything 
i do not think they improve at all as neighbours  we see nothing of them
and this is really an instance of gross inattention  charles joins me
in love and everything proper  yours affectionately
	mary m   

i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima has
just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore throat
very much about  i dare say i shall catch it and my sore throats
you know are always worse than anybody s


so ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelope
containing nearly as much more


i kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisa
bore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great deal
to add  in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday
offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed
addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to
make my letter as long as i like  the admiral does not seem very ill
and i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wants 
i shall be truly glad to have them back again  our neighbourhood
cannot spare such a pleasant family  but now for louisa 
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little 
she and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the evening
we went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprised
not to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invited
as well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reason 
neither more nor less than his being in love with louisa
and not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answer
from mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and her
before she came away and he had written to her father by captain harville 
true upon my honour  are not you astonished  i shall be surprised
at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did 
mrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter 
we are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to her
marrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayter
and mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwick
is expected to day  mrs harville says her husband feels a good deal
on his poor sister s account but however louisa is a great favourite
with both  indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love her
the better for having nursed her  charles wonders what captain wentworth
will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa
i never could see anything of it  and this is the end you see
of captain benwick s being supposed to be an admirer of yours 
how charles could take such a thing into his head was always
incomprehensible to me  i hope he will be more agreeable now 
certainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times better
than marrying among the hayters


mary need not have feared her sister s being in any degree prepared
for the news  she had never in her life been more astonished 
captain benwick and louisa musgrove  it was almost too wonderful
for belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain
in the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questions
of the moment  happily for her they were not many  sir walter
wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses
and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath
as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had
little curiosity beyond 

how is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answer
and pray what brings the crofts to bath

they come on the admiral s account  he is thought to be gouty

gout and decrepitude said sir walter  poor old gentleman

have they any acquaintance here asked elizabeth

i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s
time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance
in such a place as this

i suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croft
will be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hall 
elizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura place

oh no i think not  situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance
she might not approve  if we were not related it would not signify
but as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours 
we had better leave the crofts to find their own level 
there are several odd looking men walking about here who
i am told are sailors  the crofts will associate with them

this was sir walter and elizabeth s share of interest in the letter
when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention
in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys
anne was at liberty

in her own room she tried to comprehend it  well might charles wonder
how captain wentworth would feel  perhaps he had quitted the field
had given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love her 
she could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anything
akin to ill usage between him and his friend  she could not endure
that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly

captain benwick and louisa musgrove  the high spirited
joyous talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinking
feeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everything
that would not suit the other  their minds most dissimilar 
where could have been the attraction  the answer soon presented itself 
it had been in situation  they had been thrown together several weeks
they had been living in the same small family party  since henrietta s
coming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each other
and louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting state
and captain benwick was not inconsolable  that was a point which anne
had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing
the same conclusion as mary from the present course of events
they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some
dawning of tenderness toward herself  she did not mean however
to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than mary
might have allowed  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing
young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have
received the same compliment  he had an affectionate heart 
he must love somebody

she saw no reason against their being happy  louisa had fine
naval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alike 
he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast
for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already
of course they had fallen in love over poetry  the idea of
louisa musgrove turned into a person of literary taste
and sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubt
of its being so  the day at lyme the fall from the cobb
might influence her health her nerves her courage her character to
the end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to have
influenced her fate

the conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensible
of captain wentworth s merits could be allowed to prefer another man
there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder
and if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothing
to be regretted  no it was not regret which made anne s heart
beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks
when she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and free 
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate 
they were too much like joy senseless joy

she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took place
it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them 
the visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrove
was mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smile

the crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay street
perfectly to sir walter s satisfaction  he was not at all ashamed
of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more
about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him

the crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished for
and considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of form
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure 
they brought with them their country habit of being almost always together 
he was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croft
seemed to go shares with him in everything and to walk
for her life to do him good  anne saw them wherever she went 
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning
and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them 
knowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive picture
of happiness to her  she always watched them as long as she could
delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of
as they walked along in happy independence or equally delighted
to see the admiral s hearty shake of the hand when he encountered
an old friend and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her

anne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herself
but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days
after the croft s arrival it suited her best to leave her friend
or her friend s carriage in the lower part of the town
and return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom street
she had the good fortune to meet with the admiral  he was standing
by himself at a printshop window with his hands behind him
in earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might have
passed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address him
before she could catch his notice  when he did perceive and
acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness
and good humour  ha is it you  thank you thank you 
this is treating me like a friend  here i am you see
staring at a picture  i can never get by this shop without stopping 
but what a thing here is by way of a boat  do look at it 
did you ever see the like  what queer fellows your fine painters must be
to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that  and yet here are two gentlemen
stuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocks
and mountains as if they were not to be upset the next moment
which they certainly must be  i wonder where that boat was built
laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in it 
well turning away now where are you bound  can i go anywhere
for you or with you  can i be of any use

none i thank you unless you will give me the pleasure of your company
the little way our road lies together  i am going home


that i will with all my heart and farther too  yes yes
we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you
as we go along  there take my arm that s right i do not
feel comfortable if i have not a woman there  lord what a boat it is
taking a last look at the picture as they began to be in motion

did you say that you had something to tell me sir

yes i have presently  but here comes a friend captain brigden
i shall only say how d ye do as we pass however  i shall not stop 
how d ye do  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife 
she poor soul is tied by the leg  she has a blister on one of her heels
as large as a three shilling piece  if you look across the street
you will see admiral brand coming down and his brother  shabby fellows
both of them  i am glad they are not on this side of the way 
sophy cannot bear them  they played me a pitiful trick once 
got away with some of my best men  i will tell you the whole story
another time  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson 
look he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wife 
ah the peace has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald 
how do you like bath miss elliot  it suits us very well 
we are always meeting with some old friend or other the streets
full of them every morning sure to have plenty of chat
and then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgings
and draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynch
ay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and deal 
we do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell you
for putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouth 
the wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way

when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again
for what he had to communicate  she hoped when clear of milsom street
to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait
for the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had
gained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she was
not really mrs croft she must let him have his own way 
as soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began  

well now you shall hear something that will surprise you 
but first of all you must tell me the name of the young lady
i am going to talk about  that young lady you know that we have
all been so concerned for  the miss musgrove that all this has been
happening to  her christian name  i always forget her christian name

anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really
did but now she could safely suggest the name of louisa

ay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name  i wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine christian names  i should never be out
if they were all sophys or something of that sort  well
this miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederick 
he was courting her week after week  the only wonder was
what they could be waiting for till the business at lyme came
then indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain
was set to right  but even then there was something odd in their
way of going on  instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouth
and then he went off to see edward  when we came back from minehead
he was gone down to edward s and there he has been ever since 
we have seen nothing of him since november  even sophy could
not understand it  but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all
for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being
to marry frederick is to marry james benwick  you know james benwick

a little  i am a little acquainted with captain benwick

well she is to marry him  nay most likely they are married already
for i do not know what they should wait for

i thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anne
and i understand that he bears an excellent character

oh yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwick 
he is only a commander it is true made last summer and these are
bad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know of 
an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active
zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps
for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice

indeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spirit
from captain benwick s manners  i thought them particularly pleasing
and i will answer for it they would generally please

well well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather too
piano for me and though very likely it is all our partiality
sophy and i cannot help thinking frederick s manners better than his 
there is something about frederick more to our taste

anne was caught  she had only meant to oppose the too common idea
of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other
not at all to represent captain benwick s manners as the very best
that could possibly be and after a little hesitation
she was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparison
of the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with  

and the thing is certainly true  it is not a mere bit of gossip 
we have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letter
from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it
in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross 
i fancy they are all at uppercross

this was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said therefore
i hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captain
wentworth s letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasy 
it did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between him
and louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn out
on each side equally and without violence  i hope his letter
does not breathe the spirit of an ill used man

not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur
from beginning to end

anne looked down to hide her smile

no no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he has
too much spirit for that  if the girl likes another man better
it is very fit she should have him

certainly  but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing
in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose
he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear
you know without its being absolutely said  i should be very sorry
that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwick
should be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sort

yes yes i understand you  but there is nothing at all of that nature
in the letter  he does not give the least fling at benwick
does not so much as say i wonder at it i have a reason of my own
for wondering at it  no you would not guess from his way of writing
that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name for himself 
he very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that i think

anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meant
to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther 
she therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet
attention and the admiral had it all his own way

poor frederick said he at last  now he must begin all over again
with somebody else  i think we must get him to bath  sophy must write
and beg him to come to bath  here are pretty girls enough i am sure 
it would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that other
miss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parson 
do not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bath



chapter 19


while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressing
his wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworth
was already on his way thither  before mrs croft had written
he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him

mr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay  they were
in milsom street  it began to rain not much but enough to
make shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make it
very desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of being
conveyed home in lady dalrymple s carriage which was seen waiting
at a little distance she anne and mrs clay therefore
turned into molland s while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrymple
to request her assistance  he soon joined them again successful
of course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them home
and would call for them in a few minutes

her ladyship s carriage was a barouche and did not hold
more than four with any comfort  miss carteret was with her mother
consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation
for all the three camden place ladies  there could be no doubt
as to miss elliot  whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer none
but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility
between the other two  the rain was a mere trifle and anne was
most sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was also
a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all
and her boots were so thick much thicker than miss anne s
and in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left
to walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between them
with a generosity so polite and so determined that the others were
obliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clay
had a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appeal
that his cousin anne s boots were rather the thickest

it was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the party
in the carriage and they had just reached this point when anne
as she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctly
captain wentworth walking down the street

her start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt that
she was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountable
and absurd  for a few minutes she saw nothing before her
it was all confusion  she was lost and when she had scolded
back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage
and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street
on a commission of mrs clay s

she now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door
she wanted to see if it rained  why was she to suspect herself
of another motive  captain wentworth must be out of sight 
she left her seat she would go one half of her should not be always
so much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the other
of being worse than it was  she would see if it rained 
she was sent back however in a moment by the entrance of
captain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladies
evidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joined
a little below milsom street  he was more obviously struck
and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before
he looked quite red  for the first time since their renewed acquaintance
she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two 
she had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments 
all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects
of strong surprise were over with her  still however
she had enough to feel  it was agitation pain pleasure
a something between delight and misery

he spoke to her and then turned away  the character of his manner
was embarrassment  she could not have called it either cold or friendly
or anything so certainly as embarrassed 

after a short interval however he came towards her and spoke again 
mutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probably
much the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensible
of his being less at ease than formerly  they had by dint of being
so very much together got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it now 
time had changed him or louisa had changed him  there was consciousness
of some sort or other  he looked very well not as if he had been
suffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercross
of the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary look
of his own arch significance as he named her but yet it was
captain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he was

it did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabeth
would not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw him
that there was complete internal recognition on each side
she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance
expecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away
with unalterable coldness

lady dalrymple s carriage for which miss elliot was growing
very impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce it 
it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay
and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd
in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey
miss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend unattended but
by the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking off
and captain wentworth watching them turned again to anne
and by manner rather than words was offering his services to her

i am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with them 
the carriage would not accommodate so many  i walk  i prefer walking

but it rains

oh very little  nothing that i regard

after a moment s pause he said  though i came only yesterday
i have equipped myself properly for bath already you see
pointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of it
if you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudent
to let me get you a chair

she was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeating
her conviction that the rain would come to nothing at present
and adding i am only waiting for mr elliot  he will be here in a moment
i am sure

she had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked in 
captain wentworth recollected him perfectly  there was no difference
between him and the man who had stood on the steps at lyme
admiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and manner
of the privileged relation and friend  he came in with eagerness
appeared to see and think only of her apologised for his stay
was grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her away
without further loss of time and before the rain increased
and in another moment they walked off together her arm under his
a gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you
being all that she had time for as she passed away 

as soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth s party
began talking of them

mr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancy

oh no that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen there 
he is always with them half lives in the family i believe 
what a very good looking man

yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallises
says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with

she is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comes
to look at her  it is not the fashion to say so but i confess
i admire her more than her sister

oh so do i

and so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliot 
anne is too delicate for them

anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would have
walked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a word 
she had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothing
could exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting 
praise warm just and discriminating of lady russell
and insinuations highly rational against mrs clay  but just now
she could think only of captain wentworth  she could not understand
his present feelings whether he were really suffering much
from disappointment or not and till that point were settled
she could not be quite herself

she hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas alas
she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet

another circumstance very essential for her to know was how long
he meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could not
recollect it  he might be only passing through  but it was more probable
that he should be come to stay  in that case so liable as every body was
to meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihood
see him somewhere  would she recollect him  how would it all be

she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove
was to marry captain benwick  it had cost her something to encounter
lady russell s surprise and now if she were by any chance
to be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledge
of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him

the following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hour
in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at last
in returning down pulteney street she distinguished him
on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view
the greater part of the street  there were many other men about him
many groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking him 
she looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad idea
of her recognising him so soon as she did herself  no it was
not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they
were nearly opposite  she looked at her however from time to time
anxiously and when the moment approached which must point him out
though not daring to look again for her own countenance she knew
was unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious of
lady russell s eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him  
of her being in short intently observing him  she could thoroughly
comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell s mind
the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishment
she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over him
and in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing him
of one personal grace

at last lady russell drew back her head  now how would she
speak of him

you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long
but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and
mrs frankland were telling me of last night  they described
the drawing room window curtains of one of the houses on this
side of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomest
and best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact number
and i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confess
i can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description

anne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdain
either at her friend or herself  the part which provoked her most
was that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should have
lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them

a day or two passed without producing anything  the theatre or the rooms
where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough
for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the
elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting
more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation
sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because
her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening 
it was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrymple 
of course they must attend  it was really expected to be a good one
and captain wentworth was very fond of music  if she could only have
a few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she should
be satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred  elizabeth had turned from him
lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened
by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention

she had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with her
but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off
with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow 
mrs smith gave a most good humoured acquiescence

by all means said she only tell me all about it when you do come 
who is your party

anne named them all  mrs smith made no reply but when she was
leaving her said and with an expression half serious half arch
well i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail me
to morrow if you can come for i begin to have a foreboding
that i may not have many more visits from you

anne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment s suspense
was obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry away



chapter 20


sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliest
of all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymple
must be waited for they took their station by one of the fires
in the octagon room  but hardly were they so settled when the door
opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone  anne was
the nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spoke 
he was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you do
brought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiries
in return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back ground 
their being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothing
of their looks and felt equal to everything which she believed
right to be done

while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth
caught her ear  she could not distinguish but she must guess the subject
and on captain wentworth s making a distant bow she comprehended
that her father had judged so well as to give him that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in time
by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herself 
this though late and reluctant and ungracious was yet
better than nothing and her spirits improved

after talking however of the weather and bath and the concert
their conversation began to flag and so little was said at last
that she was expecting him to go every moment but he did not
he seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spirit
with a little smile a little glow he said  

i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme  i am afraid you must have
suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you
at the time

she assured him that she had not

it was a frightful hour said he a frightful day and he
passed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were still
too painful but in a moment half smiling again added
the day has produced some effects however has had some consequences
which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful 
when you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would be
the properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little idea
of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery

certainly i could have none  but it appears  i should hope it would be
a very happy match  there are on both sides good principles
and good temper

yes said he looking not exactly forward but there i think
ends the resemblance  with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoice
over every circumstance in favour of it  they have no difficulties
to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays 
the musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindly
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter s comfort 
all this is much very much in favour of their happiness
more than perhaps  

he stopped  a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give him
some taste of that emotion which was reddening anne s cheeks
and fixing her eyes on the ground  after clearing his throat however
he proceeded thus  

i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparity
and in a point no less essential than mind  i regard louisa musgrove
as a very amiable sweet tempered girl and not deficient in understanding
but benwick is something more  he is a clever man a reading man
and i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to her
with some surprise  had it been the effect of gratitude
had he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring him
it would have been another thing  but i have no reason to suppose it so 
it seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneous
untaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  a man like him
in his situation with a heart pierced wounded almost broken 
fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to her
was indeed attachment  a man does not recover from such
a devotion of the heart to such a woman  he ought not he does not

either from the consciousness however that his friend had recovered
or from other consciousness he went no farther and anne who
in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered
and in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaseless
slam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through
had distinguished every word was struck gratified confused
and beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred things
in a moment  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subject
and yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speaking
and having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviated
so far as to say  

you were a good while at lyme i think

about a fortnight  i could not leave it till louisa s doing well
was quite ascertained  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischief
to be soon at peace  it had been my doing solely mine 
she would not have been obstinate if i had not been weak 
the country round lyme is very fine  i walked and rode a great deal
and the more i saw the more i found to admire

i should very much like to see lyme again said anne

indeed  i should not have supposed that you could have found
anything in lyme to inspire such a feeling  the horror and distress
you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits 
i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have been
strong disgust

the last hours were certainly very painful replied anne
but when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure 
one does not love a place the less for having suffered in it
unless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which was
by no means the case at lyme  we were only in anxiety and distress
during the last two hours and previously there had been a great deal
of enjoyment  so much novelty and beauty i have travelled so little
that every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beauty
at lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollections
altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable

as she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appeared
for whom they were waiting  lady dalrymple lady dalrymple
was the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatible
with anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forward
to meet her  lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliot
and colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant
advanced into the room  the others joined them and it was
a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included 
she was divided from captain wentworth  their interesting
almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time
but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on 
she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelings
towards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think of
and she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needful
civilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensations 
she was in good humour with all  she had received ideas which
disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one
as being less happy than herself

the delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping back
from the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she saw
that he was gone  she was just in time to see him turn into
the concert room  he was gone he had disappeared she felt
a moment s regret  but they should meet again  he would look for her
he would find her out before the evening were over and at present
perhaps it was as well to be asunder  she was in need of
a little interval for recollection

upon lady russell s appearance soon afterwards the whole party
was collected and all that remained was to marshal themselves
and proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequence
in their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispers
and disturb as many people as they could

very very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked in 
elizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad back
of the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish for
which did not seem within her reach and anne  but it would be
an insult to the nature of anne s felicity to draw any comparison
between it and her sister s the origin of one all selfish vanity
of the other all generous attachment

anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room 
her happiness was from within  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed
but she knew nothing about it  she was thinking only of
the last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind took
a hasty range over it  his choice of subjects his expressions
and still more his manner and look had been such as she could see
in only one light  his opinion of louisa musgrove s inferiority
an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder
at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment
sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes
and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had
a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance
were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship
and regard but by the tenderness of the past  yes some share of
the tenderness of the past  she could not contemplate the change
as implying less  he must love her

these were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupied
and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation
and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him
without even trying to discern him  when their places were determined on
and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see
if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not
her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening
she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way

the party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches 
anne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so well
with the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by her 
miss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal object
of colonel wallis s gallantry was quite contented

anne s mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment
of the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings for
the tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientific
and patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert better
at least during the first act  towards the close of it
in the interval succeeding an italian song she explained
the words of the song to mr elliot  they had a concert bill between them

this said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the words
for certainly the sense of an italian love song must not be talked of
but it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretend
to understand the language  i am a very poor italian scholar

yes yes i see you are  i see you know nothing of the matter 
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight
these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear
comprehensible elegant english  you need not say anything more
of your ignorance  here is complete proof

i will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient

i have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so long
replied he without knowing something of miss anne elliot
and i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general
to be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplished
for modesty to be natural in any other woman

for shame for shame this is too much flattery  i forget what we are
to have next turning to the bill

perhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintance
with your character than you are aware of

indeed  how so  you can have been acquainted with it only since
i came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of
in my own family

i knew you by report long before you came to bath  i had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately  i have been acquainted
with you by character many years  your person your disposition
accomplishments manner they were all present to me

mr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise 
no one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  to have been
described long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless people
is irresistible and anne was all curiosity  she wondered
and questioned him eagerly but in vain  he delighted in being asked
but he would not tell

no no some time or other perhaps but not now  he would mention
no names now but such he could assure her had been the fact 
he had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliot
as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excited
the warmest curiosity to know her

anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with
partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford
captain wentworth s brother  he might have been in mr elliot s company
but she had not courage to ask the question

the name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to me 
very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i dared
i would breathe my wishes that the name might never change

such she believed were his words but scarcely had she
received their sound than her attention was caught by other sounds
immediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivial 
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking

a well looking man said sir walter a very well looking man

a very fine young man indeed said lady dalrymple  more air
than one often sees in bath  irish i dare say

no i just know his name  a bowing acquaintance  wentworth
captain wentworth of the navy  his sister married my tenant
in somersetshire the croft who rents kellynch

before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught
the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing
among a cluster of men at a little distance  as her eyes fell on him
his seemed to be withdrawn from her  it had that appearance 
it seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as she
dared observe he did not look again  but the performance
was recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attention
to the orchestra and look straight forward

when she could give another glance he had moved away  he could not have
come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in 
but she would rather have caught his eye

mr elliot s speech too distressed her  she had no longer
any inclination to talk to him  she wished him not so near her

the first act was over  now she hoped for some beneficial change
and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them
did decide on going in quest of tea  anne was one of the few who
did not choose to move  she remained in her seat and so did lady russell
but she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not mean
whatever she might feel on lady russell s account to shrink from
conversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunity 
she was persuaded by lady russell s countenance that she had seen him

he did not come however  anne sometimes fancied she discerned him
at a distance but he never came  the anxious interval
wore away unproductively  the others returned the room filled again
benches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasure
or of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to give
delight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailed 
to anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation 
she could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworth
once more without the interchange of one friendly look

in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which
was favourable for her  colonel wallis declined sitting down again
and mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a manner
not to be refused to sit between them and by some other removals
and a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herself
much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before
much more within reach of a passer by  she could not do so
without comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larolles
but still she did it and not with much happier effect
though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication
in her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the bench
before the concert closed

such was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworth
was again in sight  she saw him not far off  he saw her too
yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees
came at last near enough to speak to her  she felt that something
must be the matter  the change was indubitable  the difference
between his present air and what it had been in the octagon room
was strikingly great  why was it  she thought of her father
of lady russell  could there have been any unpleasant glances 
he began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captain
wentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singing
and in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over 
anne replied and spoke in defense of the performance so well
and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenance
improved and he replied again with almost a smile  they talked
for a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked down
towards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying
when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn round 
it came from mr elliot  he begged her pardon but she must be applied to
to explain italian again  miss carteret was very anxious to have
a general idea of what was next to be sung  anne could not refuse
but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit

a few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumed
and when her own mistress again when able to turn and look
as she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworth
in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  he must wish her good night
he was going he should get home as fast as he could

is not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struck
by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging

no he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying for
and he was gone directly

jealousy of mr elliot  it was the only intelligible motive 
captain wentworth jealous of her affection  could she have believed it
a week ago three hours ago  for a moment the gratification was exquisite 
but alas there were very different thoughts to succeed 
how was such jealousy to be quieted  how was the truth to reach him 
how in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations
would he ever learn of her real sentiments  it was misery to think
of mr elliot s attentions  their evil was incalculable



chapter 21


anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise
of going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from home
at the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid
mr elliot was almost a first object

she felt a great deal of good will towards him  in spite of
the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard
perhaps compassion  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which
he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation
by his own sentiments by his early prepossession  it was altogether
very extraordinary flattering but painful  there was much to regret 
how she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the case
was not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworth
and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad
her affection would be his for ever  their union she believed
could not divide her more from other men than their final separation

prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy
could never have passed along the streets of bath than anne
was sporting with from camden place to westgate buildings 
it was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way

she was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning
particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her
though it had been an appointment

an account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne s recollections
of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features
and make her rejoice to talk of it  all that she could tell
she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there
and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had
already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening
than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars
of the company  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bath
was well know by name to mrs smith

the little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouths
open to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed 
they never miss a concert

yes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they were
in the room

the ibbotsons were they there and the two new beauties
with the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of them

i do not know  i do not think they were

old lady mary maclean  i need not ask after her  she never misses
i know and you must have seen her  she must have been in your own circle
for as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeur
round the orchestra of course

no that was what i dreaded  it would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect  but happily lady dalrymple always chooses
to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is
for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen
very little

oh you saw enough for your own amusement  i can understand 
there is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd
and this you had  you were a large party in yourselves
and you wanted nothing beyond

but i ought to have looked about me more said anne conscious
while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about
that the object only had been deficient

no no you were better employed  you need not tell me that you
had a pleasant evening  i see it in your eye  i perfectly see
how the hours passed  that you had always something agreeable
to listen to  in the intervals of the concert it was conversation

anne half smiled and said do you see that in my eye

yes i do  your countenance perfectly informs me that you were
in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable
in the world the person who interests you at this present time
more than all the rest of the world put together

a blush overspread anne s cheeks  she could say nothing

and such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pause
i hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindness
in coming to me this morning  it is really very good of you
to come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demands
upon your time

anne heard nothing of this  she was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine
how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her 
after another short silence  

pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with me 
does he know that i am in bath

mr elliot repeated anne looking up surprised  a moment s reflection
shewed her the mistake she had been under  she caught it instantaneously
and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added
more composedly are you acquainted with mr elliot

i have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravely
but it seems worn out now  it is a great while since we met

i was not at all aware of this  you never mentioned it before 
had i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about you

to confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usual
air of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to have 
i want you to talk about me to mr elliot  i want your interest with him 
he can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodness
my dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourself
of course it is done

i should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingness
to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect
that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot
a greater right to influence him than is really the case 
i am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notion 
you must consider me only as mr elliot s relation  if in that light
there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him
i beg you would not hesitate to employ me

mrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said  

i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardon 
i ought to have waited for official information  but now my dear
miss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speak 
next week  to be sure by next week i may be allowed to
think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on
mr elliot s good fortune

no replied anne nor next week nor next nor next 
i assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of
will be settled any week  i am not going to marry mr elliot 
i should like to know why you imagine i am

mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled
shook her head and exclaimed  

now how i do wish i understood you  how i do wish i knew
what you were at  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel
when the right moment occurs  till it does come you know
we women never mean to have anybody  it is a thing of course among us
that every man is refused till he offers  but why should you be cruel 
let me plead for my  present friend i cannot call him but for
my former friend  where can you look for a more suitable match 
where could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable man 
let me recommend mr elliot  i am sure you hear nothing but good of him
from colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallis

my dear mrs smith mr elliot s wife has not been dead much above
half a year  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses
to any one

oh if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly
mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him 
do not forget me when you are married that s all  let him know me to be
a friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble required
which it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagements
of his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhaps 
ninety nine out of a hundred would do the same  of course
he cannot be aware of the importance to me  well my dear miss elliot
i hope and trust you will be very happy  mr elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman  your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been  you are safe in all worldly matters
and safe in his character  he will not be led astray he will not be
misled by others to his ruin

no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin 
he seems to have a calm decided temper not at all open
to dangerous impressions  i consider him with great respect 
i have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observation
to do otherwise  but i have not known him long and he is not a man
i think to be known intimately soon  will not this manner
of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me 
surely this must be calm enough  and upon my word he is nothing to me 
should he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imagine
he has any thought of doing i shall not accept him  i assure you
i shall not  i assure you mr elliot had not the share which
you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert
of last night might afford  not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that  

she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much
but less would hardly have been sufficient  mrs smith would hardly
have believed so soon in mr elliot s failure but from the perception
of there being a somebody else  as it was she instantly submitted
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anne
eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smith
should have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could have
received the idea or from whom she could have heard it

do tell me how it first came into your head

it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much
you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing
in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you
and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you
in the same way  but i never heard it spoken of till two days ago

and has it indeed been spoken of

did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when
you called yesterday

no  was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid  i observed
no one in particular

it was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by the bye
had a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the way
to let you in  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sunday
and she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliot 
she had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authority 
she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history
the whole history repeated anne laughing  she could not make
a very long history i think of one such little article
of unfounded news

mrs smith said nothing

but continued anne presently though there is no truth in my having
this claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to you
in any way that i could  shall i mention to him your being in bath 
shall i take any message

no i thank you  no certainly not  in the warmth of the moment
and under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavoured
to interest you in some circumstances but not now  no i thank you
i have nothing to trouble you with

i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years

i did

not before he was married i suppose

yes he was not married when i knew him first

and  were you much acquainted

intimately

indeed  then do tell me what he was at that time of life 
i have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young man 
was he at all such as he appears now

i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther
and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity 
they were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful  at last  

i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in her
natural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answers
i have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to do 
i have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell you 
there were many things to be taken into the account  one hates
to be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischief 
even the smooth surface of family union seems worth preserving
though there may be nothing durable beneath  however i have determined
i think i am right i think you ought to be made acquainted
with mr elliot s real character  though i fully believe that
at present you have not the smallest intention of accepting him
there is no saying what may happen  you might some time or other
be differently affected towards him  hear the truth therefore
now while you are unprejudiced  mr elliot is a man without heart
or conscience a designing wary cold blooded being who thinks
only of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guilty
of any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated without
risk of his general character  he has no feeling for others 
those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin
he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction 
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion 
oh he is black at heart hollow and black

anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause
and in a calmer manner she added

my expressions startle you  you must allow for an injured angry woman 
but i will try to command myself  i will not abuse him 
i will only tell you what i have found him  facts shall speak 
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him
and thought him as good as himself  the intimacy had been formed
before our marriage  i found them most intimate friends and i too
became excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertained
the highest opinion of him  at nineteen you know one does not
think very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as others
and much more agreeable than most others and we were almost
always together  we were principally in town living in very good style 
he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one
he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do
to support the appearance of a gentleman  he had always a home
with us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brother 
my poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the world
would have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his purse
was open to him i know that he often assisted him

this must have been about that very period of mr elliot s life
said anne which has always excited my particular curiosity 
it must have been about the same time that he became known to
my father and sister  i never knew him myself i only heard of him
but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to
my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage
which i never could quite reconcile with present times  it seemed
to announce a different sort of man

i know it all i know it all cried mrs smith  he had been
introduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with him
but i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invited
and encouraged and i know he did not choose to go  i can satisfy you
perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage
i knew all about it at the time  i was privy to all the fors and againsts
i was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and though
i did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in society
indeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwards
or at least till within the last two years of her life and can answer
any question you may wish to put

nay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about her 
i have always understood they were not a happy couple  but i should
like to know why at that time of his life he should slight
my father s acquaintance as he did  my father was certainly disposed
to take very kind and proper notice of him  why did mr elliot draw back

mr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his life
had one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quicker
process than the law  he was determined to make it by marriage 
he was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriage
and i know it was his belief whether justly or not of course
i cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilities
and invitations were designing a match between the heir
and the young lady and it was impossible that such a match
should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence 
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you 
he told me the whole story  he had no concealments with me 
it was curious that having just left you behind me in bath
my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin
and that through him i should be continually hearing of your father
and sister  he described one miss elliot and i thought
very affectionately of the other

perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes
spoke of me to mr elliot

to be sure i did very often  i used to boast of my own anne elliot
and vouch for your being a very different creature from  

she checked herself just in time

this accounts for something which mr elliot said last night
cried anne  this explains it  i found he had been used to hear of me 
i could not comprehend how  what wild imaginations one forms where
dear self is concerned  how sure to be mistaken  but i beg your pardon
i have interrupted you  mr elliot married then completely for money 
the circumstances probably which first opened your eyes
to his character

mrs smith hesitated a little here  oh those things are too common 
when one lives in the world a man or woman s marrying for money
is too common to strike one as it ought  i was very young
and associated only with the young and we were a thoughtless
gay set without any strict rules of conduct  we lived for enjoyment 
i think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given me
other notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensible
in what mr elliot was doing  to do the best for himself
passed as a duty

but was not she a very low woman

yes which i objected to but he would not regard  money money
was all that he wanted  her father was a grazier her grandfather
had been a butcher but that was all nothing  she was a fine woman
had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins
thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him
and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side
with respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in being secured
of the real amount of her fortune before he committed himself 
depend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situation
in life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for it 
his chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honour
of the family he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declare
that if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have his
for fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery included
but i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him say
on that subject  it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof
for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof

indeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne  you have asserted
nothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years ago 
this is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believe 
i am more curious to know why he should be so different now

but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary
stay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet

anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired 
the box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over it
as she unlocked it said  

this is full of papers belonging to him to my husband
a small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost him 
the letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to him
before our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imagine 
but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things
and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others
still more trivial from different people scattered here and there
while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed 
here it is i would not burn it because being even then very little
satisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every document
of former intimacy  i have now another motive for being glad
that i can produce it

this was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wells
and dated from london as far back as july 1803   

dear smith  i have received yours  your kindness almost overpowers me 
i wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i have
lived three and twenty years in the world and have seen none like it 
at present believe me i have no need of your services
being in cash again  give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and miss 
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them
this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor
to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer 
the baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry again
he is quite fool enough  if he does however they will leave me in peace
which may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  he is worse
than last year

i wish i had any name but elliot  i am sick of it  the name of walter
i can drop thank god and i desire you will never insult me
with my second w again meaning for the rest of my life
to be only yours truly  wm elliot

such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow
and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said  

the language i know is highly disrespectful  though i have forgot
the exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaning 
but it shows you the man  mark his professions to my poor husband 
can any thing be stronger

anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification
of finding such words applied to her father  she was obliged to recollect
that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour
that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies
that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others
before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter
which she had been meditating over and say  

thank you  this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thing
you were saying  but why be acquainted with us now

i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling

can you really

yes  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years ago
and i will shew him as he is now  i cannot produce written proof again
but i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of what
he is now wanting and what he is now doing  he is no hypocrite now 
he truly wants to marry you  his present attentions to your family
are very sincere  quite from the heart  i will give you my authority 
his friend colonel wallis

colonel wallis you are acquainted with him

no  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that
it takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  the stream
is as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turnings
is easily moved away  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallis
of his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to be
in himself a sensible careful discerning sort of character
but colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whom
he tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to her 
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all
to her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with you
very naturally brings it all to me  on monday evening my good friend
mrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildings 
when i talked of a whole history therefore you see i was
not romancing so much as you supposed

my dear mrs smith your authority is deficient  this will not do 
mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account
for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father 
that was all prior to my coming to bath  i found them on
the most friendly terms when i arrived

i know you did i know it all perfectly but  

indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real information
in such a line  facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands
of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another
can hardly have much truth left

only give me a hearing  you will soon be able to judge of
the general credit due by listening to some particulars
which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm 
nobody supposes that you were his first inducement  he had seen you
indeed before he came to bath and admired you but without
knowing it to be you  so says my historian at least  is this true 
did he see you last summer or autumn somewhere down in the west
to use her own words without knowing it to be you

he certainly did  so far it is very true  at lyme 
i happened to be at lyme

well continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted  he saw you then
at lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased
to meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliot
and from that moment i have no doubt had a double motive
in his visits there  but there was another and an earlier
which i will now explain  if there is anything in my story which you know
to be either false or improbable stop me  my account states
that your sister s friend the lady now staying with you
whom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walter
as long ago as september in short when they first came themselves
and has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuating
handsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situation
and manner as to give a general idea among sir walter s acquaintance
of her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprise
that miss elliot should be apparently blind to the danger

here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say
and she continued  

this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family
long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye
upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then
visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest
in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath
for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas
colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things
and the reports beginning to prevail  now you are to understand
that time had worked a very material change in mr elliot s opinions
as to the value of a baronetcy  upon all points of blood and connexion
he is a completely altered man  having long had as much money
as he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avarice
or indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness
upon the consequence he is heir to  i thought it coming on
before our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feeling 
he cannot bear the idea of not being sir william  you may guess
therefore that the news he heard from his friend could not be
very agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolution
of coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself here
for a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintance
and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means
of ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the lady
if he found it material  this was agreed upon between the two friends
as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist
in every way that he could  he was to be introduced and mrs wallis
was to be introduced and everybody was to be introduced 
mr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgiven
as you know and re admitted into the family and there it was
his constant object and his only object till your arrival
added another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clay 
he omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their way
called at all hours but i need not be particular on this subject 
you can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guide
perhaps may recollect what you have seen him do

yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with
what i have known or could imagine  there is always something offensive
in the details of cunning  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises me 
i know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliot
who would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfied 
i have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared 
i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability
of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger
to be lessening or not

lessening i understand replied mrs smith  he thinks mrs clay
afraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceed
as she might do in his absence  but since he must be absent
some time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be secure
while she holds her present influence  mrs wallis has an amusing idea
as nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articles
when you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs clay 
a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts
but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it  why to be sure
ma am said she it would not prevent his marrying anybody else
and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heart
is a very strenuous opposer of sir walter s making a second match 
she must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you know
and since self will intrude who can say that she may not have
some flying visions of attending the next lady elliot through
mrs wallis s recommendation

i am very glad to know all this said anne after a little
thoughtfulness  it will be more painful to me in some respects
to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do 
my line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evidently
a disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never had
any better principle to guide him than selfishness

but mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carried away
from her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interest
of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied
against him but her attention was now called to the explanation
of those first hints and she listened to a recital which
if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smith
proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her
very deficient both in justice and compassion

she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired
by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together
and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune 
mrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender
of throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance 
from his wife s account of him she could discern mr smith to have been
a man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strong
understanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike him
led by him and probably despised by him  mr elliot raised by
his marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratification
of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself
for with all his self indulgence he had become a prudent man
and beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himself
to be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend s
probable finances but on the contrary had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smiths
accordingly had been ruined

the husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of it 
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship
of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried
but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs
was fully known  with a confidence in mr elliot s regard
more creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith had
appointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not act
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been such
as could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened to
without corresponding indignation

anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to
urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same
stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and
under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference
to any of the evils it might bring on her  it was a dreadful picture
of ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some moments
that no flagrant open crime could have been worse  she had a great deal
to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae
of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been
merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence 
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only
the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s
usual state of mind

there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances
of particular irritation  she had good reason to believe
that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been
for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of
its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures
and this property though not large would be enough to make her
comparatively rich  but there was nobody to stir in it 
mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself
equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness
and from employing others by her want of money  she had no
natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel
and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law 
this was a cruel aggravation of actually streightened means 
to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble
in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be
even weakening her claims was hard to bear

it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices
with mr elliot  she had previously in the anticipation
of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it
but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature
since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred
that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman
he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings
as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow
when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed
the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope
of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least
the comfort of telling the whole story her own way

after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but
express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably
in the beginning of their conversation  she had seemed to recommend
and praise him

my dear was mrs smith s reply there was nothing else to be done 
i considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yet
have made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of him
than if he had been your husband  my heart bled for you
as i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeable
and with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopeless 
he was very unkind to his first wife  they were wretched together 
but she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved her 
i was willing to hope that you must fare better

anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility
of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea
of the misery which must have followed  it was just possible that
she might have been persuaded by lady russell  and under such
a supposition which would have been most miserable when time had
disclosed all too late

it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference
which carried them through the greater part of the morning
was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend
everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved



chapter 22


anne went home to think over all that she had heard  in one point
her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot 
there was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  he stood as
opposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness
and the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischief
he might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexed 
pity for him was all over  but this was the only point of relief 
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward
she saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concerned
for the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feeling
for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister
and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing
how to avert any one of them  she was most thankful for her own
knowledge of him  she had never considered herself as entitled to reward
for not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here was
a reward indeed springing from it  mrs smith had been able to tell her
what no one else could have done  could the knowledge have
been extended through her family  but this was a vain idea 
she must talk to lady russell tell her consult with her
and having done her best wait the event with as much composure
as possible and after all her greatest want of composure would be
in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russell
in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself


she found on reaching home that she had as she intended
escaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid them
a long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herself
and felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the evening

i had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabeth
with affected carelessness but he gave so many hints
so mrs clay says at least

indeed i do say it  i never saw anybody in my life spell harder
for an invitation  poor man  i was really in pain for him
for your hard hearted sister miss anne seems bent on cruelty

oh cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game
to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints  however when i found
how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father
this morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omit
an opportunity of bring him and sir walter together  they appear to
so much advantage in company with each other  each behaving so pleasantly 
mr elliot looking up with so much respect

quite delightful cried mrs clay not daring however
to turn her eyes towards anne  exactly like father and son 
dear miss elliot may i not say father and son

oh i lay no embargo on any body s words  if you will have such
ideas  but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentions
being beyond those of other men

my dear miss elliot exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyes
and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence

well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him 
i did invite him you know  i sent him away with smiles 
when i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry park
for the whole day to morrow i had compassion on him

anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew
such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival
of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with
her prime object  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate
the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging
placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license
of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have
done otherwise

to anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the room
and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her 
she had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere
but now she saw insincerity in everything  his attentive deference
to her father contrasted with his former language was odious
and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smith
she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness
or the sound of his artificial good sentiments 

she meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke
a remonstrance on his side  it was a great object to her to escape
all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool
to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace
as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had
been gradually led along  she was accordingly more guarded
and more cool than she had been the night before

he wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where
he could have heard her formerly praised wanted very much
to be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was broken 
he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary
to kindle his modest cousin s vanity he found at least that it was
not to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazard
among the too commanding claims of the others  he little surmised
that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest
bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct
which were least excusable

she had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of bath
the next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater part
of two days  he was invited again to camden place the very evening of
his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain 
it was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before her
but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party
seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort 
it was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practiced
on her father and elizabeth to consider the various sources
of mortification preparing for them  mrs clay s selfishness was
not so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compounded
for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot s
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it

on friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russell
and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone
directly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going out
on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which
determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion 
she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk
of spending the morning in rivers street

very well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my love 
oh you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me
and pretend i have read it through  i really cannot be plaguing myself
for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out 
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications 
you need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other night 
i used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of her
at the concert  something so formal and arrange in her air
and she sits so upright  my best love of course

and mine added sir walter  kindest regards  and you may say
that i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil message
but i shall only leave my card  morning visits are never fair
by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little 
if she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen
but last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediately

while her father spoke there was a knock at the door  who could it be 
anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliot
would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off 
after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard
and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room

surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance
but anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry
but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon
as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived
with an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabeth
were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well 
they were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and were
at the white hart  so much was pretty soon understood
but till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary into
the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration
anne could not draw upon charles s brain for a regular history
of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints
of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by mary
as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of

she then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henrietta
and captain harville beside their two selves  he gave her a very plain
intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw
a great deal of most characteristic proceeding  the scheme
had received its first impulse by captain harville s wanting to
come to bath on business  he had begun to talk of it a week ago
and by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposed
coming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of it
very much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bear
to be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or two
everything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  but then
it had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother had
some old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thought
a good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding clothes
for herself and her sister and in short it ended in being
his mother s party that everything might be comfortable and easy
to captain harville and he and mary were included in it
by way of general convenience  they had arrived late the night before 
mrs harville her children and captain benwick remained with
mr musgrove and louisa at uppercross

anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of  she had imagined
such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent
the marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles that
very recently since mary s last letter to herself charles hayter
had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth
who could not possibly claim it under many years and that
on the strength of his present income with almost a certainty
of something more permanent long before the term in question
the two families had consented to the young people s wishes
and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months
quite as soon as louisa s  and a very good living it was
charles added  only five and twenty miles from uppercross
and in a very fine country   fine part of dorsetshire 
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom
surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous
than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get
a special recommendation  not that he will value it as he ought
he observed charles is too cool about sporting that s the worst of him

i am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly glad
that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve
equally well and who have always been such good friends
the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other  
that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort 
i hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both

oh yes  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richer
but he has no other fault to find  money you know coming down with
money  two daughters at once  it cannot be a very agreeable operation
and it streightens him as to many things  however i do not mean to say
they have not a right to it  it is very fit they should have
daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind
liberal father to me  mary does not above half like henrietta s match 
she never did you know  but she does not do him justice
nor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend to
the value of the property  it is a very fair match as times go
and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now

such excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anne
should be happy in their children s marriages  they do everything
to confer happiness i am sure  what a blessing to young people
to be in such hands  your father and mother seem so totally free
from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct
and misery both in young and old  i hope you think louisa
perfectly recovered now

he answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recovered
but she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughing
or dancing it is quite different  if one happens only to shut the door
a little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab chick in the water
and benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to her
all day long

anne could not help laughing  that cannot be much to your taste
i know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young man

to be sure he is  nobody doubts it and i hope you do not think
i am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself  i have a great value for benwick and when one can
but get him to talk he has plenty to say  his reading has done him
no harm for he has fought as well as read  he is a brave fellow 
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before 
we had a famous set to at rat hunting all the morning in
my father s great barns and he played his part so well
that i have liked him the better ever since

here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles s
following the others to admire mirrors and china but anne had
heard enough to understand the present state of uppercross
and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced
her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it  she would certainly
have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want
to lessen theirs

the visit passed off altogether in high good humour  mary was
in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change
and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage
with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place
that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought
and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house
as they were detailed to her  she had no demands on her father or sister
and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing rooms

elizabeth was for a short time suffering a good deal 
she felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be asked
to dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of style
the reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by those
who had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynch 
it was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the better
and then elizabeth was happy again  these were her internal persuasions 
old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess
to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does
did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here a month 
and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove
put her quite out of her way  i am sure she would rather not come
she cannot feel easy with us  i will ask them all for an evening
that will be much better that will be a novelty and a treat 
they have not seen two such drawing rooms before  they will be delighted
to come to morrow evening  it shall be a regular party small
but most elegant  and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitation
was given to the two present and promised for the absent
mary was as completely satisfied  she was particularly asked
to meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteret
who were fortunately already engaged to come and she could not
have received a more gratifying attention  miss elliot was to have
the honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morning
and anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see her
and henrietta directly

her plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the present 
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes
but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart
to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn
with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form

they found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves
and anne had the kindest welcome from each  henrietta was exactly
in that state of recently improved views of fresh formed happiness
which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had
ever liked before at all and mrs musgrove s real affection had been won
by her usefulness when they were in distress  it was a heartiness
and a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the more
from the sad want of such blessings at home  she was entreated
to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day
and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return
she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance
and on charles s leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove s
history of louisa and to henrietta s of herself giving opinions
on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help
which mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts
from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying
to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which mary
well amused as she generally was in her station at a window
overlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but have
her moments of imagining

a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  a large party
in an hotel ensured a quick changing unsettled scene  one five minutes
brought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been there
half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was
seemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friends
were seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back with
captains harville and wentworth  the appearance of the latter
could not be more than the surprise of the moment  it was impossible
for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their
common friends must be soon bringing them together again 
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings
she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared
from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had
hastened him away from the concert room still governed 
he did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation

she tried to be calm and leave things to take their course
and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence  
surely if there be constant attachment on each side our hearts
must understand each other ere long  we are not boy and girl
to be captiously irritable misled by every moment s inadvertence
and wantonly playing with our own happiness  and yet
a few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in company
with each other under their present circumstances could only be
exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most
mischievous kind

anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay
i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her 
i saw them turn the corner from bath street just now  they seemed
deep in talk  who is it  come and tell me  good heavens i recollect 
it is mr elliot himself

no cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure you 
he was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come back
till to morrow

as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her
the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret
that she had said so much simple as it was

mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin
began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting
still more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anne
to come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stir
and tried to be cool and unconcerned  her distress returned
however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between
two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves
quite in the secret  it was evident that the report concerning her
had spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensure
that it would now spread farther

do come anne cried mary come and look yourself  you will be too late
if you do not make haste  they are parting they are shaking hands 
he is turning away  not know mr elliot indeed  you seem to have
forgot all about lyme

to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment
anne did move quietly to the window  she was just in time to ascertain
that it really was mr elliot which she had never believed
before he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly off
on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel
at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons
of totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliot
certainly  he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is all
or i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chair
recomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself well

the visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them off
and then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with  

well mother i have done something for you that you will like 
i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night 
a n t i a good boy  i know you love a play and there is room for us all 
it holds nine  i have engaged captain wentworth  anne will
not be sorry to join us i am sure  we all like a play 
have not i done well mother

mrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness
for the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when mary
eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming  

good heavens charles how can you think of such a thing 
take a box for to morrow night  have you forgot that we are engaged
to camden place to morrow night and that we were most particularly asked
to meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and all
the principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to them 
how can you be so forgetful

phoo phoo replied charles what s an evening party 
never worth remembering  your father might have asked us to dinner
i think if he had wanted to see us  you may do as you like
but i shall go to the play

oh charles i declare it will be too abominable if you do
when you promised to go

no i did not promise  i only smirked and bowed and said the word
happy  there was no promise

but you must go charles  it would be unpardonable to fail 
we were asked on purpose to be introduced  there was always
such a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselves 
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately 
we are quite near relations you know and mr elliot too
whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with  every attention
is due to mr elliot  consider my father s heir  the future
representative of the family

don t talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charles 
i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow
to the rising sun  if i would not go for the sake of your father
i should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir 
what is mr elliot to me  the careless expression was life to anne
who saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking and
listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought
his enquiring eyes from charles to herself

charles and mary still talked on in the same style he half serious
and half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and she
invariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omitting
to make it known that however determined to go to camden place herself
she should not think herself very well used if they went to the play
without her  mrs musgrove interposed

we had better put it off  charles you had much better go back
and change the box for tuesday  it would be a pity to be divided
and we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father s
and i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the play
if miss anne could not be with us

anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much
so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying  

if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home
excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment 
i have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happy
to change it for a play and with you  but it had better
not be attempted perhaps  she had spoken it but she trembled
when it was done conscious that her words were listened to
and daring not even to try to observe their effect

it was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the day
charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife
by persisting that he would go to the play to morrow if nobody else would

captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place
probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards
and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne

you have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoy
the evening parties of the place

oh no  the usual character of them has nothing for me 
i am no card player

you were not formerly i know  you did not use to like cards
but time makes many changes

i am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing she
hardly knew what misconstruction  after waiting a few moments
he said and as if it were the result of immediate feeling
it is a period indeed  eight years and a half is a period

whether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne s imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds
he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henrietta
eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out
and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else
should come in

they were obliged to move  anne talked of being perfectly ready
and tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have known
the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair
in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own
sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection
wherewith to pity her

their preparations however were stopped short  alarming sounds
were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open
for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give
a general chill  anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked
saw symptoms of the same  the comfort the freedom the gaiety
of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence
or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister 
how mortifying to feel that it was so

her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  captain wentworth
was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before 
she even addressed him once and looked at him more than once 
elizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  the sequel
explained it  after the waste of a few minutes in saying
the proper nothings she began to give the invitation which
was to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgroves 
to morrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal party 
it was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she had
provided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the table
with a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile and
one card more decidedly for captain wentworth  the truth was
that elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his 
the past was nothing  the present was that captain wentworth
would move about well in her drawing room  the card was pointedly given
and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared

the interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out
but not to anne  she could think only of the invitation she had
with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which
it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather
than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance 
she knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe
that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement
for all the insolence of the past  her spirits sank  he held the card
in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it

only think of elizabeth s including everybody whispered mary
very audibly  i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted 
you see he cannot put the card out of his hand

anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away
that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her

the party separated  the gentlemen had their own pursuits
the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while
anne belonged to them  she was earnestly begged to return and dine
and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been
so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more
and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent
as she chose

promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore
she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden place
there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements
of elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow s party the frequent enumeration
of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all
the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant
of its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never ending
question of whether captain wentworth would come or not  they were
reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude
never appeased for five minutes together  she generally thought
he would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a case
which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion
as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings

she only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation
to let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliot
three hours after his being supposed to be out of bath
for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview
from the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to her
there was guilt in mrs clay s face as she listened  it was transient 
cleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read there
the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick
or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend
perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs
on sir walter  she exclaimed however with a very tolerable
imitation of nature   

oh dear very true  only think miss elliot to my great surprise
i met with mr elliot in bath street  i was never more astonished 
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard  he had been prevented
setting off for thornberry but i really forget by what
for i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answer
for his being determined not to be delayed in his return 
he wanted to know how early he might be admitted to morrow 
he was full of to morrow and it is very evident that i have been
full of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extension
of your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never have
gone so entirely out of my head



chapter 23


one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith
but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched
by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter
that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer
her explanatory visit in rivers street  she had promised to be
with the musgroves from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plighted
and mr elliot s character like the sultaness scheherazade s head
must live another day

she could not keep her appointment punctually however
the weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rain
on her friends account and felt it very much on her own
before she was able to attempt the walk  when she reached the white hart
and made her way to the proper apartment she found herself
neither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrive 
the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft
and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard
that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment
it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest
injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there
till they returned  she had only to submit sit down
be outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at once
in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of
tasting a little before the morning closed  there was no delay
no waste of time  she was deep in the happiness of such misery
or the misery of such happiness instantly  two minutes after
her entering the room captain wentworth said  

we will write the letter we were talking of harville now
if you will give me materials

materials were at hand on a separate table he went to it
and nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writing

mrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldest
daughter s engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voice
which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper 
anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet
as captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk
she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as
how mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and again
to talk it over what my brother hayter had said one day
and what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred
to my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and what
i said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded
to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style
of open hearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantage
of taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not give
could be properly interesting only to the principals  mrs croft
was attending with great good humour and whenever she spoke at all
it was very sensibly  anne hoped the gentlemen might each be
too much self occupied to hear

and so ma am all these thing considered said mrs musgrove
in her powerful whisper though we could have wished it different
yet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longer
for charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta was
pretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at once
and make the best of it as many others have done before them 
at any rate said i it will be better than a long engagement

that is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs croft 
i would rather have young people settle on a small income at once
and have to struggle with a few difficulties together than be
involved in a long engagement  i always think that no mutual  

oh dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let her
finish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young people
as a long engagement  it is what i always protested against
for my children  it is all very well i used to say for young people
to be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marry
in six months or even in twelve but a long engagement  

yes dear ma am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement
an engagement which may be long  to begin without knowing
that at such a time there will be the means of marrying
i hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parents
should prevent as far as they can

anne found an unexpected interest here  she felt its application
to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same
moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table
captain wentworth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing
listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look
one quick conscious look at her

the two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of
a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation
but anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear
her mind was in confusion

captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it
now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him
though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible
that he was inviting her to join him where he stood  he looked at her
with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed
come to me i have something to say and the unaffected
easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance
than he really was strongly enforced the invitation  she roused herself
and went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other end
of the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearer
to captain wentworth s table not very near  as she joined him
captain harville s countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful
expression which seemed its natural character

look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying
a small miniature painting do you know who that is

certainly  captain benwick

yes and you may guess who it is for  but in a deep tone
it was not done for her  miss elliot do you remember our
walking together at lyme and grieving for him  i little thought then  
but no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met with
a clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promise
to my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for her 
and i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another 
it was a commission to me  but who else was there to employ 
i hope i can allow for him  i am not sorry indeed to make it
over to another  he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworth
he is writing about it now  and with a quivering lip he wound up
the whole by adding poor fanny she would not have forgotten him so soon

no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believe

it was not in her nature  she doted on him

it would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved

captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that
for your sex and she answered the question smiling also
yes  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us 
it is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselves 
we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us 
you are forced on exertion  you have always a profession pursuits
business of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediately
and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions

granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
which however i do not think i shall grant it does not apply
to benwick  he has not been forced upon any exertion  the peace
turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us
in our little family circle ever since

true said anne very true i did not recollect but what shall
we say now captain harville  if the change be not from
outward circumstances it must be from within it must be nature
man s nature which has done the business for captain benwick

no no it is not man s nature  i will not allow it to be more
man s nature than woman s to be inconstant and forget those they do love
or have loved  i believe the reverse  i believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies are
the strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usage
and riding out the heaviest weather

your feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spirit
of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender 
man is more robust than woman but he is not longer lived
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments 
nay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwise 
you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with 
you are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardship 
your home country friends all quitted  neither time nor health
nor life to be called your own  it would be hard indeed
with a faltering voice if woman s feelings were to be
added to all this

we shall never agree upon this question captain harville
was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention
to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room 
it was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne was
startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined
to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been
occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think
he could have caught

have you finished your letter said captain harville

not quite a few lines more  i shall have done in five minutes

there is no hurry on my side  i am only ready whenever you are 
i am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well supplied
and want for nothing  no hurry for a signal at all  well miss elliot
lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree
i suppose upon this point  no man and woman would probably 
but let me observe that all histories are against you  all stories
prose and verse  if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring you
fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not think
i ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say
upon woman s inconstancy  songs and proverbs all talk
of woman s fickleness  but perhaps you will say these were all
written by men

perhaps i shall  yes yes if you please no reference to examples
in books  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story 
education has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen has
been in their hands  i will not allow books to prove anything

but how shall we prove anything

we never shall  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a point 
it is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof 
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex
and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it
which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances
perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such
as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence
or in some respect saying what should not be said

ah cried captain harville in a tone of strong feeling
if i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes
a last look at his wife and children and watches the boat
that he has sent them off in as long as it is in sight
and then turns away and says god knows whether we ever meet again 
and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does
see them again when coming back after a twelvemonth s absence
perhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soon
it be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himself
and saying they cannot be here till such a day but all the while
hoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at last
as if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still 
if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and do
and glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence 
i speak you know only of such men as have hearts pressing his own
with emotion

oh cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by you
and by those who resemble you  god forbid that i should undervalue
the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow creatures 
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment
and constancy were known only by woman  no i believe you capable
of everything great and good in your married lives  i believe you equal
to every important exertion and to every domestic forbearance
so long as  if i may be allowed the expression  so long as you have
an object  i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for you 
all the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable one
you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence
or when hope is gone

she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart
was too full her breath too much oppressed

you are a good soul cried captain harville putting his hand
on her arm quite affectionately  there is no quarreling with you 
and when i think of benwick my tongue is tied

their attention was called towards the others  mrs croft was taking leave

here frederick you and i part company i believe said she 
i am going home and you have an engagement with your friend 
to night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party
turning to anne  we had your sister s card yesterday
and i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see it
and you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselves

captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either
could not or would not answer fully

yes said he very true here we separate but harville and i
shall soon be after you that is harville if you are ready
i am in half a minute  i know you will not be sorry to be off 
i shall be at your service in half a minute

mrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letter
with great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurried
agitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  anne know not how
to understand it  she had the kindest good morning god bless you
from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look 
he had passed out of the room without a look

she had only time however to move closer to the table where
he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning
the door opened it was himself  he begged their pardon
but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room
to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper
placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her
for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room
almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it 
the work of an instant

the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almost
beyond expression  the letter with a direction hardly legible
to miss a e   was evidently the one which he had been folding
so hastily  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwick
he had been also addressing her  on the contents of that letter
depended all which this world could do for her  anything was possible
anything might be defied rather than suspense  mrs musgrove had
little arrangements of her own at her own table to their protection
she must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupied
succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written
her eyes devoured the following words 


i can listen no longer in silence  i must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach  you pierce my soul  i am half agony
half hope  tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelings
are gone for ever  i offer myself to you again with a heart
even more your own than when you almost broke it eight years
and a half ago  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  woman
that his love has an earlier death  i have loved none but you 
unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been
but never inconstant  you alone have brought me to bath 
for you alone i think and plan  have you not seen this 
can you fail to have understood my wishes  i had not waited even
these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have
penetrated mine  i can hardly write  i am every instant hearing
something which overpowers me  you sink your voice but i can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others 
too good too excellent creature  you do us justice indeed 
you do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men 
believe it to be most fervent most undeviating in f w

i must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hither
or follow your party as soon as possible  a word a look
will be enough to decide whether i enter your father s house
this evening or never


such a letter was not to be soon recovered from  half and hour s solitude
and reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes only
which now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraints
of her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  every moment
rather brought fresh agitation  it was overpowering happiness 
and before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation
charles mary and henrietta all came in

the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then
an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more 
she began not to understand a word they said and was obliged
to plead indisposition and excuse herself  they could then see
that she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would not
stir without her for the world  this was dreadful  would they only
have gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that room
it would have been her cure but to have them all standing or
waiting around her was distracting and in desperation
she said she would go home

by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly
and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening 
i wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myself 
charles ring and order a chair  she must not walk

but the chair would never do  worse than all  to lose the possibility
of speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quiet
solitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting him
could not be borne  the chair was earnestly protested against
and mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness
having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall
in the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped down
and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having
had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on
finding her better at night

anxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said  

i am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood 
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope
to see your whole party this evening  i am afraid there had been
some mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harville
and captain wentworth that we hope to see them both

oh my dear it is quite understood i give you my word 
captain harville has no thought but of going

do you think so  but i am afraid and i should be so very sorry 
will you promise me to mention it when you see them again 
you will see them both this morning i dare say  do promise me

to be sure i will if you wish it  charles if you see captain harville
anywhere remember to give miss anne s message  but indeed my dear
you need not be uneasy  captain harville holds himself quite engaged
i ll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare say

anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance
to damp the perfection of her felicity  it could not be very lasting
however  even if he did not come to camden place himself
it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence
by captain harville  another momentary vexation occurred 
charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her
there was no preventing him  this was almost cruel  but she could not
be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s
to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling
but gratitude apparent

they were on union street when a quicker step behind a something
of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight
of captain wentworth  he joined them but as if irresolute
whether to join or to pass on said nothing only looked 
anne could command herself enough to receive that look
and not repulsively  the cheeks which had been pale now glowed
and the movements which had hesitated were decided  he walked by her side 
presently struck by a sudden thought charles said  

captain wentworth which way are you going  only to gay street
or farther up the town

i hardly know replied captain wentworth surprised

are you going as high as belmont  are you going near camden place 
because if you are i shall have no scruple in asking you
to take my place and give anne your arm to her father s door 
she is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help
and i ought to be at that fellow s in the market place 
he promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off
said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment
that i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chance 
by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine
which you shot with one day round winthrop

there could not be an objection  there could be only the most
proper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public view
and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture 
in half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street again
and the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passed
between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet
and retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would make
the present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for all
the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives
could bestow  there they exchanged again those feelings
and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything
but which had been followed by so many many years of division
and estrangement  there they returned again into the past
more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when
it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed
in a knowledge of each other s character truth and attachment
more equal to act more justified in acting  and there as they slowly
paced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around them
seeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepers
flirting girls nor nursery maids and children they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements and especially in
those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment
which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  all the little
variations of the last week were gone through and of yesterday
and today there could scarcely be an end

she had not mistaken him  jealousy of mr elliot had been
the retarding weight the doubt the torment  that had begun to operate
in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned
after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him
in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do
in the last four and twenty hours  it had been gradually yielding
to the better hopes which her looks or words or actions
occasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last by
those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked
with captain harville and under the irresistible governance of which
he had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelings

of what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualified 
he persisted in having loved none but her  she had never been supplanted 
he never even believed himself to see her equal  thus much indeed
he was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciously
nay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed it
to be done  he had imagined himself indifferent when he had only
been angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had been
a sufferer from them  her character was now fixed on his mind
as perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude
and gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercross
had he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begun
to understand himself  at lyme he had received lessons
of more than one sort  the passing admiration of mr elliot
had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at
captain harville s had fixed her superiority

in his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrove
the attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for ever
felt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not care
for louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflection
which followed it he had not understood the perfect excellence
of the mind with which louisa s could so ill bear a comparison
or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own 
there he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle
and the obstinacy of self will between the darings of heedlessness
and the resolution of a collected mind  there he had seen everything
to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begun
to deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentment
which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way

from that period his penance had become severe  he had no sooner
been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days
of louisa s accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again
than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty

i found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man 
that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our
mutual attachment  i was startled and shocked  to a degree
i could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflect
that others might have felt the same  her own family nay
perhaps herself  i was no longer at my own disposal  i was hers in honour
if she wished it  i had been unguarded  i had not thought seriously
on this subject before  i had not considered that my excessive intimacy
must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i had
no right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girls
at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no other
ill effects  i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences

he found too late in short that he had entangled himself
and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring
for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her
if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed 
it determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewhere 
he would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings or
speculations concerning him might exist and he went therefore
to his brother s meaning after a while to return to kellynch
and act as circumstances might require

i was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happy 
i could have no other pleasure  i deserved none  he enquired after you
very particularly asked even if you were personally altered
little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter

anne smiled and let it pass  it was too pleasing a blunder
for a reproach  it is something for a woman to be assured
in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm
of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased
to anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be
the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment

he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride
and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa
by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement
with benwick

here said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at least
put myself in the way of happiness i could exert myself
i could do something  but to be waiting so long in inaction
and waiting only for evil had been dreadful  within the first
five minutes i said i will be at bath on wednesday and i was 
was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrive
with some degree of hope  you were single  it was possible that
you might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragement
happened to be mine  i could never doubt that you would be loved and
sought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one man
at least of better pretensions than myself and i could not help
often saying was this for me

their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be said
but the concert still more  that evening seemed to be made up
of exquisite moments  the moment of her stepping forward
in the octagon room to speak to him  the moment of mr elliot s appearing
and tearing her away and one or two subsequent moments
marked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt on
with energy

to see you cried he in the midst of those who could not be
my well wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smiling
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match 
to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope
to influence you  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent
to consider what powerful supports would be his  was it not enough
to make the fool of me which i appeared  how could i look on
without agony  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you
was not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influence
the indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done  
was it not all against me

you should have distinguished replied anne  you should not have
suspected me now the case is so different and my age is so different 
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that
it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk 
when i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be called
in aid here  in marrying a man indifferent to me all risk
would have been incurred and all duty violated

perhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could not 
i could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquired
of your character  i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed
buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under
year after year  i could think of you only as one who had yielded
who had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by me 
i saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery 
i had no reason to believe her of less authority now  the force of habit
was to be added

i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself
might have spared you much or all of this

no no your manner might be only the ease which your engagement
to another man would give  i left you in this belief and yet
i was determined to see you again  my spirits rallied with the morning
and i felt that i had still a motive for remaining here

at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived  all the surprise and suspense and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation
she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy
in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last 
an interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective
of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went
to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness
of her enjoyment

the evening came the drawing rooms were lighted up the company assembled 
it was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had
never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business
too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never found
an evening shorter  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness
and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for
she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her 
mr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him 
the wallises she had amusement in understanding them  lady dalrymple
and miss carteret  they would soon be innoxious cousins to her 
she cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for in
the public manners of her father and sister  with the musgroves
there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville
the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell
attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short
with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and
fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal
and with captain wentworth some moments of communications
continually occurring and always the hope of more and always
the knowledge of his being there

it was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupied
in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said  

i have been thinking over the past and trying impartially
to judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myself
and i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from it
that i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom
you will love better than you do now  to me she was in the place
of a parent  do not mistake me however  i am not saying
that she did not err in her advice  it was perhaps one of those cases
in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides
and for myself i certainly never should in any circumstance
of tolerable similarity give such advice  but i mean that i was right
in submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should have
suffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it up
because i should have suffered in my conscience  i have now
as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothing
to reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of duty
is no bad part of a woman s portion

he looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at her
replied as if in cool deliberation  

not yet  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in time 
i trust to being in charity with her soon  but i too have been
thinking over the past and a  question has suggested itself
whether there may not have been one person more my enemy
even than that lady  my own self  tell me if when i returned
to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds
and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you
would you have answered my letter  would you in short
have renewed the engagement then

would i was all her answer but the accent was decisive enough

good god he cried you would  it is not that i did not think of it
or desire it as what could alone crown all my other success
but i was proud too proud to ask again  i did not understand you 
i shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justice 
this is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one
sooner than myself  six years of separation and suffering
might have been spared  it is a sort of pain too which is new to me 
i have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn
every blessing that i enjoyed  i have valued myself on honourable toils
and just rewards  like other great men under reverses he added
with a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune 
i must learn to brook being happier than i deserve



chapter 24


who can be in doubt of what followed  when any two young people
take it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseverance
to carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudent
or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other s ultimate comfort 
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth
and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and
an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind
consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them
fail of bearing down every opposition  they might in fact
have borne down a great deal more than they met with for there was
little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth 
sir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worse
than look cold and unconcerned  captain wentworth with five and twenty
thousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activity
could place him was no longer nobody  he was now esteemed quite worthy
to address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronet
who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself
in the situation in which providence had placed him and who could
give his daughter at present but a small part of the share
of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter

sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne
and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion
was very far from thinking it a bad match for her  on the contrary
when he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylight
and eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claims
and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced
against her superiority of rank and all this assisted by
his well sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his pen
with a very good grace for the insertion of the marriage
in the volume of honour

the only one among them whose opposition of feeling could excite
any serious anxiety was lady russell  anne knew that lady russell
must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliot
and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with
and do justice to captain wentworth  this however was what
lady russell had now to do  she must learn to feel that she had
been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced
by appearances in each that because captain wentworth s manners
had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them
to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because
mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety
and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been
too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct
opinions and well regulated mind  there was nothing less
for lady russell to do than to admit that she had been
pretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinions
and of hopes

there is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernment
of character a natural penetration in short which no experience
in others can equal and lady russell had been less gifted
in this part of understanding than her young friend  but she was
a very good woman and if her second object was to be sensible
and well judging her first was to see anne happy  she loved anne
better than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardness
of the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herself
as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child

of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance  it was creditable to have a sister married
and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental
to the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumn
and as her own sister must be better than her husband s sisters
it was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man than
either captain benwick or charles hayter  she had something to suffer
perhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restored
to the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette
but she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolation 
anne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estate
no headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworth
from being made a baronet she would not change situations with anne

it would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied
with her situation for a change is not very probable there 
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw
and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise
even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him

the news of his cousins anne s engagement burst on mr elliot
most unexpectedly  it deranged his best plan of domestic happiness
his best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulness
which a son in law s rights would have given  but though discomfited
and disappointed he could still do something for his own interest
and his own enjoyment  he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay s
quitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as established
under his protection in london it was evident how double a game
he had been playing and how determined he was to save himself
from being cut out by one artful woman at least

mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed
for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer
for sir walter  she has abilities however as well as affections
and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hers
may finally carry the day whether after preventing her from being
the wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at last
into making her the wife of sir william

it cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shocked
and mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery of
their deception in her  they had their great cousins to be sure
to resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatter
and follow others without being flattered and followed in turn
is but a state of half enjoyment

anne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell s meaning
to love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloy
to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness
of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value 
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly  the disproportion
in their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment s regret
but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly
nothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offer
in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her
in his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively pain
as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise
strong felicity  she had but two friends in the world to add to his list
lady russell and mrs smith  to those however he was very well disposed
to attach himself  lady russell in spite of all her former transgressions
he could now value from his heart  while he was not obliged to say
that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them
he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour
and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her
quickly and permanently

her recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselves
and their marriage instead of depriving her of one friend
secured her two  she was their earliest visitor in their settled life
and captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recovering
her husband s property in the west indies by writing for her
acting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficulties
of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man
and a determined friend fully requited the services which
she had rendered or ever meant to render to his wife

mrs smith s enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income
with some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friends
to be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not
fail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity 
she might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy
and yet be happy  her spring of felicity was in the glow
of her spirits as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart 
anne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of it
in captain wentworth s affection  his profession was all that could ever
make her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future war
all that could dim her sunshine  she gloried in being a sailor s wife
but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession
which is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtues
than in its national importance

gorgono _and_ slith  


 let us  by all means  be lucid   said gorgono to slith  slith fluttered
his reptile tongue and turned his morbid eyes to me   yes   he said 
 let us  certainly be lucid  bradbury  from now on use a contents page
in futuria fantasia   and he spanked his tail slickly on my typewriter 

i don t mind slith so much  he s only a little anachronistic reptile  a
descendent of happier days in dinosaurial dawndom  i never feared slith 
but gorgono 

gorgono pierced me with his slanting green  clear eyes  heavy lidded 
extending one claw and attempting to keep it from shaking while his
pointed ears stood up straight  a moment before he had been hunting
fleas in the fertile hair that clothed his muscular limbs  but now he
was serious  so very serious it frightened me 

and when the thunder voiced  evil eyed  shaggy haired and monstrous
gorgono reclined on the shelf over my head  saliva drooling with silent
precision from his pendulous lips  and gave orders i hastened to obey
them  gorgono was the voice of the critics  the ogre of opinion  the
harsh guttural commandment of style and fashion  and now gorgono had
grumbled   number your pages from now on  mister bradbury or else your
number ll be up  why  gad  man  the last issue of futuria fantasia i
didn t know if i was coming or going  the way you heiroglyphed the
sheets  and i might add  you re going to use even margins from here on
in  

 okay  okay  okay   i said  slinking with flushed visage behind my
stencils   but from now on futuria fantasia will be ten cents straight
an issue  ten cents straight    agreed   snapped gorgono   if you are
neater  but you must be new  neotiric  different   then i flashed them
the newly processed cover done by bok   gods   bellowed gorgono   that
is stupendous  a fine beginning  mortal  a very fine beginning   slith
agreed by pounding vigorously on the table with his scaly rump   and
wait until you read monroe s yarn   i jubilantly exclaimed   it s not
science fiction  but it s certainly a fine bit of story    yes   said
gorgono   this issue looks much better  glad to see you ve added two new
authors  damon knight and joe kelleam from astounding  i ll have to
remind the fans to send in their dimes for this issue and perhaps
support you a little more than they have with letters  but we ll see
about that   he got up  stretched  yawned  and vanished in a belching
ball of flame   yes   said slith   we ll see   and he too vanished with
a sharp pop  all was quiet  i went back to my stencils and my opium

 how dare you make such a suggestion  

the state physician doggedly stuck by his position   i would not make
it  sire  it your life were not at stake  there is no other surgeon in
the fatherland who can transplant a pituitary gland but doctor lans  

 you will operate  

the medico shook his head   you would die  leader  my skill is not
adequate  and unless the operation takes place at once  you will
_certainly_ die  

the leader stormed about the apartment  he seemed about to give way to
one of the girlish bursts of anger that even the inner state clique
feared so much  surprisingly he capitulated 

 bring him here   he ordered 

doctor lans faced the leader with inherent dignity  a dignity and
presence that three years of  protective custody  had been unable to
shake  the pallor and gauntness of the concentration camp lay upon him 
but his race was used to oppression   i see   he said   yes  i see     i
can perform that operation  what are your terms  

 terms   the leader was aghast   terms  you filthy swine  you are being
given a chance to redeem in part the sins of your race  

the surgeon raised his brows   do you not think i _know_ that you would
not have sent for me had there been any other course available to you 
obviously  my services have become valuable  

 you ll do as you are told  you and your kind are lucky to be alive  

 nevertheless i shall not operate without my fee  

 i said you were lucky to be alive    the tone was an open threat 

lans spread his hands   well  i am an old man     

the leader smiled   true  but i am informed that you have a  a
family     

the surgeon moistened his lips  his emma  they would hurt his emma    
and his little rose  but he must be brave  as emma would have him be  he
was playing for high stakes  for all of them   they cannot be worse off
dead   he answered firmly   than they are now  

it was many hours before the leader was convinced that lans could not be
budged  he should have known  the surgeon had learned fortitude at his
mother s breast 

 what is your fee  

 a passport for myself and my family  

 good riddance  

 my personal fortune restored to me   

 very well  

   to be paid in gold before i operate  

the leader started to object automatically  then checked himself
quickly  let the presumptuous fool think so  it could be corrected after
the operation 

 and the operation to take place in a hospital on foreign soil  

 preposterous  

 i must insist  

 you do not trust me  

lans stared straight back into his eyes without replying  the leader
struck him  hard  across the mouth  the surgeon made no effort to avoid
the blow  but took it  with no change of expression 

 you are willing to go through with it  samuel   the younger man looked
at doctor lans without fear as he answered 

 certainly  doctor  

 i can not guarantee that you will recover  the leader s pituitary gland
is diseased  when i exchange it for your healthy one your younger one
may not be able to stand up under it  that is the chance you take 
besides  a complete transplanting has never been done before  

 i know it  but i m out of the concentration camp  

 yes  yes  that is true  and if you do recover  you are free  and i will
attend you myself  until you are well enough to travel  

samuel smiled   it will be a positive joy to be sick in a country where
there are no concentration camps  

 very well  then  let us commence  

they returned to the silent  nervous group at the other end of the room 
grimly the money was counted out  every penny that the famous surgeon
had laid claim to before the leader had decided that men of his religion
had no need for money  lans placed half of the gold in a money belt and
strapped it around his waist  his wife concealed the other half
somewhere about her ample person 

it was an hour and twenty minutes later that lans put down the last
instrument  nodded to the surgeons assisting him  and commenced to strip
off operating gloves  he took one last look at his two patients before
he left the room  they were anonymous under the sterile gowns and
dressings  had he not known  he could not have guessed dictator from
oppressed  come to think of it  with the exchange of those two tiny
glands there was something of the dictator in his victim and something
of the victim in the dictator 

doctor lans returned to the hospital later in the day  after seeing his
wife and daughter safely settled in a first class hotel  it was an
extravagence  in view of his uncertain prospects as a refugee  but they
had enjoyed no luxuries for years back _there_  he didn t consider it
his home country  and it was justified this once 

he inquired at the office of the hospital for his second patient  the
clerk looked puzzled   but he is not here     

 not here  

 why  no  he was moved at the same time as his excellency  back to your
country  

lans did not argue  the trick was obvious  it was too late to do
anything for poor samuel  he thanked his god that he had had the
foresight to place himself and his family beyond the reach of such
brutal injustice before operating  he thanked the clerk and left 

the leader recovered consciousness at last  his brain was confused  then
he recalled the events before he had gone to sleep  the operation   it
was over  and he was alive  he had never admitted to anyone how terribly
frightened he had been at the prospect  but he had lived  he had lived 
he groped around for the bellcord  and failing to find it  gradually
forced his eyes to focus on the room  what outrageous nonsense was this 
this was no sort of a room for the leader to convalesce in  he took in
the dirty white washed ceiling  and the bare wooden floor with distaste 
and the bed  it was no more than a cot 

he shouted  someone came in  a man wearing a uniform of a trooper in his
favorite corps  he started to give him the tongue lashing of his life 
before having him arrested  but he was cut short 

 cut out the racket  you unholy pig  

at first he was too astounded to answer  then he shrieked   stand at
attention when you address the leader  salute  

the trooper looked dumbfounded at the sick man  so totally different in
appearance from the leader  then guffawed  he stepped to the cot  struck
a pose with his right arm raised in salute  he carried a rubber
truncheon in it   hail to our leader   he shouted  and brought his arm
down smartly  the truncheon crashed into the sick man s cheek bone 

another trooper came in to see what the noise was while the first was
still laughing at his wittcism   what s up  jon  say  you d better not
handle that monkey too rough  he s still carried on the hospital list  
he glanced casually at the bloody face 

 him  didn t you know   jon pulled him to one side and whispered 

the second man s eyes widened  he grinned   so  they don t want him to
get well  eh  well  i could use a little exercise this morning   

 let s get fats   the other suggested   he s always so very amusing with
his ideas  

 good idea   he stepped to the door and bellowed   hey  fats  

they didn t really start in on him until fats was there to help

the phantoms

_by_    joseph e  kellerman


    all day they played among the purple flowers
    that lay like frozen flames upon the lawn 
    or dreamed within the shadows of the towers
    whose turret tops were painted as the dawn 
    bright was the garden  peace went everywhere
    there was no breath of movement nor any sound
    save butterflies that clove the heavy air 
    or when the bright fruit dropped slowly to the ground 
    then the flowers drooped  from sliver thorns that tore 
    too soon the sun had died in amber smoke 
    and frightened now but silent as before
    the phantoms watched the garden change its cloak 
    great sable moths flew out  and one by one
    the towers melted with the fallen sun

_thoughts on the_ worldstate

_by henry kuttner_

 illustration 

 sidenote  the hideous mr  kuttner returns with an equally hideous tale 
we absolutely guarantee this story will induce nausea and slight
regurgitation  lead on  mckuttner  


i have  as usual  been brooding over the intricacies of modern
civilization  it seems to me that life is a peculiarly futile business 
this mood of mine may  perhaps  be attributed to my recent tragic
encounter with a horse at the corner of 42nd and broadway 

i shall not dwell upon that incident  save to mention briefly that
horses should  at least  be careful of what they eat  one never knows
the result of the most innocent action  and that  by imperceptible
degrees  brings me to the subject of this article  playing fair with
fans  or  fantastic decency 

it has been said  and very loudly  too  that fans fight a lot  well  i
do not care to refute that  i happen to know that a californian fan  a
mr  ackerman  is in the habit of knocking down visitors and kicking them
in strategic places  the question naturally arises  does fantasy lead to
sadism 

i am reminded of the remarkable case of scarlett o god  an ardent fan
whose tininess led to her being occasionally called by the diminutive 
or fanny  this may seem somewhat confusing at first glance  let us 
therefore  go hastily on to the next paragraph 

i should  perhaps  mention a mysterious white bearded gentleman called
tarboth the damned  or toby  since he played a significant role in the
incident  it was he who listened  toying at his beard idly  while
scarlett feverishly upheld her position against the onslaughts of her
foes  just what caused the argument i cannot recall at the moment  nor
does it matter especially  i believe it had something to do with
scarlett s being locked out of the sanctuary  or washroom  by previous
arrivals 

mocked  scorned  and jeered at  scarlett at first said nothing 
ultimately  however  she lost her temper and cursed her enemies roundly 
 i would   she observed with feeling   sell my soul to the devil in
order to obtain vengeance  

at this moment the white bearded gentleman smiled unpleasently and
vanished  simultaneously lightning struck the sanctuary and demolished
it  to the natural discomfiture of the occupants  laughing in a
triumphant manner  scarlett departed 

but the seeds of doom were already sown within her soul  not until she
was soaked to the skin did she realize the ghastly and hideous truth 
then  looking up  she saw that above her hovered a small black cloud 
from which rain was steadily descending  as she realized the terror of
her position  black horror flooded the girl  she had become allergic to
weather 

well  after that  of course  matters got steadily worse  she was driven
from home  after blasting the bathtub and spoiling a valuable angora
kitten   it was later made into a muff  but moths got into it  that 
however  is another story  and not an especially good one  

poor scarlett was excluded from all fan gatherings  sun stroke and
eclipse were her constant companions  she came with the deluge and was
gone with the wind 

the girl was utterly friendless  she roamed wildly here and there 
haggard  careworn and miserable  in a tattered gown made from the covers
of amazing stories  at night people could hear her moaning under their
windows  and they huddled closer to the fire  whispering   fetch aft the
rum  darby  evil walks abroad tonight and i feel my soul shudder in me 
no soda  thanks  

hopeless and forlorn  scarlett stowed away on a schooner out for hong
kong  but she was discovered  cursed for a jonah  and set ashore on a
cannibal isle in the south seas 

it was a blessing in disguise  the natives mistook her for a goddess 
they were used to bad weather  and did not attribute the altered climate
to scarlett 

so they garlanded her with leis and made her their queen 

and she rained happily ever after

    would you stroll with me  my loved one
       neath the pale venusian moon 
    where its misty orb goes drifting 
      waning  darling  all too soon 
    would you gaze into the rainbow
      where the lunar moonbeams play 
    could it be you d softly answer
      yes  for all those things i pray  
    if it s so  my darling  kick me 
      for i d surely be a ninny

_the piper_

_ron reynolds_

 illustration 


 lord  he s there again  he s there  look   the old man croaked  jabbing
a calloused finger at the burial hill   old piper again  as crazy as a
loon  every year that way  

the martian boy at the feet of the old man stirred his thin reddish feet
in the soil and affixed his large green eyes upon the burial hill where
the piper stood   why does he do that   asked the boy 

 ah   the old man s leathery face rumpled into a maze of wrinkles   he s
crazy  that s what  stands up there piping on his music from sunset
until dawn  

the thin piping sounds squealed in the dusk  echoed back from the low
hills  were lost in melancholy silence  fading  then louder  higher 
insanely  crying with shrill voice 

the piper was a tall  gaunt man  face as pale and wan as martian moons 
eyes electrical purple  standing against the soft of the dusking heaven 
holding his pipe to his lips  playing  the piper  a silhouette  a
symbol  a melody 

 where did the piper come from   asked the martian boy 

 from venus   the old man took out his pipe and filled it   oh  some
twenty years ago or more  on the projectile with the terrestrians  i
arrived on the same ship  coming from earth  we shared a double seat
together  

 what is his name   again the boyish  eager voice 

 i can t remember  i don t think i ever knew  really  

a vague rustling sound came into existence  the piper continued playing 
paying no heed to it  from the darkness  across the star jewelled
horizon  came mysterious shapes  creeping  creeping 

 mars is a dying world   the old man said   nothing ever happens of much
gravity  the piper  i believe  is an exile  

the stars trembled like reflections in water  dancing with the music 

 an exile   the old man continued   something like a leper  they called
him the brilliant  he was the epitome of all venerian culture until the
earthmen came with their greedy incorporations and licentious harlots 
the earthlings outlawed him  sent him here to mars to live out his
days  

 mars is a dying world   repeated the boy   a dying world  how many
martians are there  sir  

the old man chuckled   i guess maybe you are the last pure martian
alive  boy  but there are millions of others  

 where do they live  i have never seen them  

 you are young  you have much to see  much to learn  

 where do they live  

 out there  beyond the mountains  beyond the dead sea bottoms  over the
horizon and to the north  in the caves  far back in the subterrane  

 why  

 why  now that s hard to say  they were a brilliant race once upon a
time  but something happened to them  hybrided them  they are
unintelligent creatures now  cruel beasts  

 does earth own mars   the little boy s eyes were riveted upon the
glowing planet overhead  the green planet 

 yes  all of mars  earth has three cities here  each containing one
thousand people  the closest city is a mile from here  down the road  a
group of small metal bubble like buildings  the men from earth move
about among the buildings like ants enclosed in their space suits  they
are miners  with their huge machines they rip open the bowels of our
planet and dig out our precious life blood from the mineral arteries  

 is that all  

 that is all   the old man shook his head sadly   no culture  no art  no
purpose  greedy  hopeless earthlings  

 and the other two cities    where are they  

 one is up the same cobbled road five miles  the third is further still
by some five hundred miles  

 i am glad i live here with you  alone   the boy s head nodded sleepily 
 i do not like the men from terra  they are despoilers  

 they have always been  but someday   said the old man   they will meet
their doom  they have blasphemed enough  have they  they cannot _own_
planets as they have and expect nothing but greedy luxury for their
sluggishly squat bodies  someday       his voice rose high  in tempo and
pitch with the piper s wild music 

wild music  insane music  stirring music  music to stir the savage into
life  music to effect man s destiny 

     wild eyed piper on the hill 
    crying out your rigadoons 
    bring the savages to kill
     neath the waning martian moons  

 what is that   asked the boy 

 a poem   said the old man   a poem i have written in the last few days 
i feel something is going to happen very soon  the piper s song is
growing more insistent every night  at first  twenty years ago  he
played on only a few nights of every year  but now  for the last three
years he has played until dawn every night of every autumn when the
planet is dying  

 bring the savages   the boy sat up   what savages  

 there  

along the star glimmered mountain tops a vast clustering herd of black 
murmuring  advancing  the music screamed higher and higher 

     piper  pipe that song again 
    so he piped  i wept to hear  

 more of the poem   asked the boy 

 not my poem  but a poem from earth some seventy years ago  i learned it
in school  

 music is strange   the little boy s eyes were scintillant with thought 
 it warms me inside  this music makes me angry  why  

 because it is music with a purpose  

 what purpose  

 we shall know by dawn 

 music is the language of all things  intelligent or not  savage or
educated civilian  this piper knows his music as a god knows his heaven 
for twenty years he has composed his hymn of action and hate and
finally  tonight perhaps  the finale will be reached  at first  many
years ago  when he played  he received no answer from the subterrane 
but the murmur of gibbering voices  five years ago he lured the voices
and the creatures from their caves to the mountain tops  tonight  for
the first time  the herd of black will spill over the trails toward our
hovel  toward the road  toward the cities of man  

music screaming  higher  faster  insanely  sending shock after macabre
shock thru night air  loosening the stars from their riveted stations 
the piper stretched high  six feet or more  upon his hillock  swaying
back and forth  his thin shape attired in brown cloth  the black mass on
the mountain came down like amoebic tentacles  met and coalesced 
muttering and mumbling   go inside and hide   said the old man   you are
young  you must live to propagate the new mars  tonight is the end of
the old  tomorrow begins the new  it is death for the men of earth  
higher still and higher   death  they come to overrun the earthlings 
destroy their cities  take their projectiles  then  in the ships of
man  to earth  turnabout  revolution and revenge  a new civilization 
when monsters usurp men and men s greediness crumbles at his demise  
shriller  faster  higher  insanely tempoed   the piper  the brilliant
one  he who has waited for years for this night  back to venus to
reinstall the glory of his civilization  the return of art to humanity  

 but they are savages  these unpure martians   the boy cried 

 men are savages  i am ashamed of being a man   the old man said 
tremblingly   yes  these creatures are savages  but they will
learn  these brutes  with music  music in many forms    music for peace 
music for love  music for hate and music for death  the piper and his
brood will set up a new cosmos  he is immortal   now  hurrying 
muttering up the road  the first cluster of black things reminiscent of
men  a strange sharp odor in the air  the piper  from his hillock 
walking down the road  over the cobbles  to the city   piper  pipe that
song again   cried the old man   go and kill and live again  bring us
love and art again  piper  pipe the song  i weep   then   hide  child 
hide quickly  before they come  hurry   and the child  crying  hurried
to the small house and hid himself thru the night 

swirling  jumping  running  leaping  gamboling  crying  the new humanity
surged to man s cities  his rockets  his mines  the piper s song  stars
shuddered  winds stilled  nightbirds sang no songs  echoes murmured only
the voices of the ones who advanced  bringing new understanding  the old
man  caught in the whirlpool of ebon  was swept down  screaming  then up
the road  by the awful thousands  vomiting out of hills  sprawling from
caves  curling  huge fingers of beasts  around and about and down to the
man cities  sighing  leaping up  voices and destruction 

rockets across the sky 

guns  death 

and finally  in the pale advancement of dawn  the memory  the echoing of
the old man s voice  and the little boy arose to start afresh a new
world with a new mate 

echoing  the old man s voice 

 piper  pipe that song again  so he piped  i wept to hear  

a new day dawned

_the itching hour_

by damon knight


mind you  i don t believe the story  myself  it was obvious  from the
start  that the old man was mad  besides  i was stinko at the time  and
i may not have got some of the details right  but in its essentials  the
story still sticks in my mind     i can see the old man now  with a pair
of my best socks around his neck  moaning and wheezing and spitting on
the floor  and in between times telling his strange  strange story  of
course  the whole thing was fantastic  the old loon had probably escaped
from some nut factory     and yet     no  no  the old man was booby  and
yet     and yet    

the night it happened i was sitting in my study in my white silk russian
lounging robe  smoking a narghile or indian water pipe and throwing
darts at a signed photograph of sally rand  i d just pinked her neatly
in the gluteus maximus  when i was startled by a crash of glass  and
turned around to see an aged man tottering carefully thru the remains of
my french windows 

at once the chill of horror griped me  oops  i mean _gripped_   unable
to move  i stared speechlessly as the old man went directly to my chest
of drawers and fumbled within  the overhead light throwing his face into
sombre shadow 

blowing his nose on one of my dress shirts he grumbled to himself about
the starch and selected a pair of lamb s wool socks and tied them around
his neck  this done  he hobbled over to a chair facing mine  sat down 
pulled his tattered undershirt  which for some reason he was wearing as
a shawl  more closely around his thin shoulders  stared reproachfully at
me  shivering at the icy blast that came in thru the shattered windows 
 there s a draft in here  and you know what you can do about it   he
complained 

 yes  there is   i managed to get out 

he nodded  satisfied   i thought there was   he said  then  dragging his
chair closer  he leaned over and  grasping me firmly by the lapels  said
pleasently   ipswitch on the amscray  don t you think  

half stifled with terror  i gasped   uh  yes   at once his manner was
transformed  drawing himself up indignantly he sneered  that s a lie 
that s what they all say  the sniveling hypocrites  they know it s a
lie  

then he drew nearer once again   but   he said   i m going to tell you
my story anyway  you have a kind face  and i  i just don t have any at
all   he raised the rim of his hat and i saw it was true  he had no
face  gibbering  i tried to get away  to flee or scram  but it was too
late  taking a firmer grip on my lapels  and standing heavily on my
foot  the old man began his story 

 you may not believe it  he began  but i  too  was once a carefree young
fan like yourself  from morning til night i thot of nothing but eating 
sleeping  sex  and my fan mag  puke  in the evening i would stay up til
morning  splashing happily in my hecto inks  and turning out pages and
pages of material like mad  and at last i d go to bed  tired but happy 
knowing i had done my duty as an honest fan 

 and then  one day  it happened  by some unfortunate chance  i got a
little double strength purple hectograph ink on my face  noticing it in
the mirror the next morning  as i was trying to decide whether to shave
this week or not  i took a washcloth and tried to rub off the stain 
alas  poor fool that i was  i recked not of the consequences 

 with hard rubbing  i managed to get some of the ink off  but when i
went on rubbing  to remove the rest  the ink i had rubbed off was
transferred back to my face  and so it went  the adament ink going from
washrag to face and from face back to washrag 

 the ink  as i have said  was double strength purple undiluted  and
suffered nothing in the process  but something had to give way  the
washrag  by an unhappy coincidence  was a brand new one  and my face was
some years old  only one thing could have happened  it did  

thus  shedding a tear on the carpet  the old stranger ended his weird
tale  getting slowly to his feet  he drew his hat down over his eyes
once more  tied his socks around his neck more tightly  and shuffled off
toward the shattered windows  at the sill  he turned  faced the room 
and made one last parting shot  ere he vanished in the gloom   _dogs
have fleas _  he screamed 

but sometimes i wonder

    they say the bittern and the cormorant
    have nested in the upper lintels there 
    the wind builds flowers of dust upon the air 
    lifting and falling  slow and hesitant 
    within the crumbling temples beasts have laired 
    eyeless the windows  broken the terraces 
    no laughter breaks the silence  the palaces
    are weathered and the cedar work is bared 

    if this be glory s wage  then let me trust
    the fragile things that are not built of might 
    the lovely things that leave no trace when gone 
    the rose that swiftly turns into the dust 
    beauty that blazed a moment    or a night
    of golden stars forgotten with the dawn

  sir 

i have received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me on
the 9th instant  as well as the memorial enclosed in it  i
communicated the paper to the marquis de castries  and i make no
doubt  but that the minister will take into consideration its
contents  as far as circumstances will permit  we are desirous to
adopt every measure  that may tend to the prosperity of the commerce
established between france and the united states  and we shall neglect
nothing to accomplish this object to the universal satisfaction of the
two countries  congress will greatly facilitate our labor  if they
will communicate their ideas and wishes on this subject  and i make
the request with greater confidence  as i am convinced that that
assembly desires as much as we do to establish  on an advantageous and
solid basis  the commercial concerns between france and america 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have received and laid before the king your letters of the 17th 
18th  and 21st ultimo  and i am commanded to signify to you his
majesty s approbation of your conduct in communicating to the american
commissioners the fourth article of your instructions  which could not
but convince them  that the negotiation for peace  and the cession of
independence to the thirteen united colonies  were intended to be
carried on and concluded with the commissioners in europe 

those gentlemen having expressed their satisfaction concerning that
article  it is hoped they will not entertain a doubt of his majesty s
determination to exercise  in the fullest extent  the powers with
which the act of parliament has invested him  by granting to america 
full  complete  and unconditional independence  in the most explicit
manner  as an article of treaty

  sir 

i have just received yours  no  13  dated the 23d of june  the
accounts of the general sentiments of our people  respecting
propositions from england  and the rejoicings on the birth of the
dauphin  give pleasure here  and it affords me much satisfaction to
find the conduct of congress approved by all who hear or speak of it 
and to see all the marks of a constantly growing regard for us  and
confidence in us  among those in whom such sentiments are most to be
desired 

i hope the affair of captain asgill was settled as it ought to be  by
the punishment of lippincott  applications have been made here to
obtain letters in favor of the young gentleman  enclosed i send you a
copy of the answer i gave to that made to me 

i had before acquainted m  tousard  that his pension would be paid in
america  and there only  it being unreasonable to expect that congress
should open a pay office in every part of the world  where pensioners
should choose to reside  i shall communicate to him that part of your
letter 

you wish to know what allowance i make to my private secretary  my
grandson  william t  franklin  came over with me  served me as a
private secretary during the time of the commissioners  and no
secretary to the commission arriving  though we had been made to
expect one  he did business for us all  and this without any allowance
for his services  though both mr lee and mr deane at times mentioned
it to me as a thing proper to be done  and in justice due to him  when
i became appointed sole minister here  and the whole business  which
the commissioners had before divided with me  came into my hands  i
was obliged to exact more service from him  and he was indeed  by
being so long in the business  become capable of doing more  at
length  in the beginning of the year 1781 when he became of age 
considering his constant close attention to the duties required  and
his having thereby missed the opportunity of studying the law  for
which he had been intended  i determined to make him some
compensation for the time past  and fix some compensation for the time
to come  till the pleasure of congress respecting him should be known 
i accordingly settled an account with him  allowing him from the
beginning of december 1776 to the end of 1777  the sum of 3 400
livres  and for the year 1778  the sum of 4 000 livres  for 1779 
4 800 livres  and for 1780  6 000 livres  since that time i have
allowed him at the rate of three hundred louis per annum  being what i
saw had been allowed by congress to the secretary of mr william lee 
who could not have had  i imagine  a fourth part of the business to go
through  since my secretary  besides the writing and copying the
papers relative to my common ministerial transactions  has had all
those occasioned by my acting in the various employments of judge of
admiralty  consul  purchaser of goods for the public   c   c  besides
that of accepting the congress bills  a business that requires being
always at home  bills coming by post  from different ports and
countries  and often requiring immediate answers  whether good or not 
and to that end  it being necessary to examine by the books  exactly
kept of all preceding acceptances  in order to detect double
presentations  which happen very frequently  the great number of these
bills makes almost sufficient business for one person  and the
confinement they occasion is such  that we cannot allow ourselves a
day s excursion into the country  and the want of exercise has hurt
our healths in several instances 

the congress pay much larger salaries to some secretaries  who  i
believe  deserve them  but not more than my grandson does the
comparatively small one i have allowed to him  his fidelity 
exactitude  and address in transacting business  being really what one
could wish in such an officer  and the genteel appearance a young
gentleman in his station obliges him to make  requiring at least such
an income  i do not mention the extraordinary business that has been
imposed upon us in this embassy  as a foundation for demanding higher
salaries than others  i never solicited for a public office  either
for myself  or any relation  yet i never refused one  that i was
capable of executing  when public service was in question  and i never
bargained for salary  but contented myself with whatever my
constituents were pleased to allow me  the congress will therefore
consider every article charged in my account  distinct from the salary
originally voted  not as what i presume to insist upon  but as what i
propose only for their consideration  and they will allow what they
think proper 

you desire an accurate estimate of those contingent expenses  i
enclose copies of two letters  1  which passed between mr adams and me
on the subject  and show the articles of which they consist  their
amount in different years may be found in my accounts  except the
article of house rent  which has never yet been settled  m  de
chaumont  our landlord  having originally proposed to leave it till
the end of the war  and then to accept for it a piece of american land
from the congress  such as they might judge equivalent  if the
congress did intend all contingent charges whatever to be included in
the salary  and do not think proper to pay on the whole so much  in
that case i would humbly suggest  that the saving may be most
conveniently made by a diminution of the salary  leaving the
contingencies to be charged  because they may necessarily be very
different in different years  and at different courts 

i have been more diffuse on this subject  as your letter gave occasion
for it  and it is probably the last time i shall mention it  be
pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  assure them of my
best services  and believe me to be  with sincere esteem   c

_p  s _ as you will probably lay this letter before congress  i take
the liberty of joining to it an extract of my letter to the president 
of the 12th of march  1781  and of repeating my request therein
contained  relative to my grandson  i enclose  likewise  extracts of
letters from messrs jay and laurens  which both show the regard those
gentlemen have for him  and their desire of his being noticed by the
congress  2

                                             madrid  april 25th  1781 

  the letters herewith enclosed from dr franklin were left open for my
  perusal  the short stay of my courier at paris not allowing time for
  copies to be made of the information conveyed in and with it 

  i perceive that dr franklin desires to retire  this circumstance calls
  upon me to assure congress  that i have reason to be perfectly
  satisfied with his conduct towards me  and that i have received from
  him all the aid and attention i could wish or expect  his character is
  very high here  and i really believe  that the respectability he
  enjoys throughout europe has been of general use to our cause and
  country

                                             madrid  april 21st  1781 

  by the letter from dr franklin  herewith enclosed  and which he was so
  obliging as to leave open for my perusal  i find he has requested
  permission to retire  on account of his age  infirmities   c  how far
  his health may be impaired i know not  the letters i have received
  from him bear no marks of age  and there is an acuteness and
  sententious brevity in them  which do not indicate an understanding
  injured by years  i have many reasons to think our country much
  indebted to him  and i confess it would mortify my pride as an
  american  if his constituents should be the only people to whom his
  character is known  and that should deny to his merit and services the
  testimony given them by other nations  justice demands of me to assure
  you  that his reputation and respectability are acknowledged  and have
  weight here  and that i have received from him all that uniform
  attention and aid  which were due to the importance of the affairs
  committed to me 

  the affectionate mention he makes of his only descendant  on whom the
  support of his name and family will devolve  is extremely amiable  and
  flows in a delicate manner from that virtuous sensibility  by which
  nature kindly extends the benefits of parental affection  to a period
  beyond the limits of our lives  this is an affectionate subject  and
  minds susceptible of the finer sensations are insensibly led at least
  to wish that the feelings of an ancient patriot  going  in the evening
  of a long life early devoted to the public  to enjoy repose in the
  bosom of philosophic retirement  may be gratified by seeing some
  little sparks of the affection of his country rest on the only support
  of his age and hope of his family  such are the effusions of my heart
  on this occasion  and i pour them into yours  from a persuasion  that
  they will meet with a hospitable reception from congenial emotions

    sir 

  i snatch a moment to pay my last respects to your excellency  and to
  mention a matter  which has occurred to me since my being on board  i
  have frequently reflected upon the mention  which your excellency has
  made of retiring from your present important station  and have never
  varied the opinion  which i took the liberty of giving you once at the
  count de vergennes   viz  that the best arrangement would be to give
  your excellency an active  intelligent secretary of the embassy  who
  might relieve you from the drudgery of office  and that your country
  should not be deprived of the advantages of your wisdom and influence 
  the difficulty hitherto has been to find a person properly qualified 
  the advantages  which your grandson derives from his knowledge of the
  language  and manners of the people  and his having been so long in
  your office  and with your excellency  are very great  the prejudices 
  which have been entertained against him  may be removed by a personal
  introduction to congress  especially if it is combined with rendering
  a popular service  i take the liberty of proposing to your excellency 
  therefore  if you can spare mr franklin for the purpose  to commit to
  his care the second remittance of money  and to hasten his departure
  with that  and as much of the public supplies of clothing   c  as may
  be ready to accompany it  i am persuaded  that in public bodies  the
  want of a personal acquaintance is a great objection to appointing a
  man to any important office 

  the engageante s boat demands my letter  i have written in the
  greatest haste upon a subject  which i hope your excellency will turn
  to public utility 

    i am   c

  dear sir 

mr oswald s courier being returned  with directions to him to make the
independence of america the first article in the treaty  i would wait
on you if i could  to discourse on the subject  but as i cannot  i
wish to see you here this evening  if not inconvenient to you 

with great esteem  i have the honor to be  dear sir  your most
obedient and most humble servant

                                    philadelphia  september 5th  1782 

  sir 

having written to you lately  i should not again trouble you so soon 
were it not necessary to remind you  that your last letter is dated in
march  since which there have been frequent arrivals from france  and
since which too we have reason to believe  the most interesting
events have taken place in europe 

we learn from private letters and common fame  that mr adams was
received by the united provinces in his public character  on the 19th
of april  we have yet no account of this interesting event  nor of the
measures he has pursued to accomplish our other objects in holland 
since then mr laurens  it is said  has been liberated  has travelled
to holland and to france  has entered upon the execution of his trust 
but has left us to gather events so interesting to him and to us from
private letters  and the public prints  mr jay tells us on the 24th of
may  that he is about to set out for paris  and that he presumes dr
franklin has assigned the reasons for this step  doctor franklin has
told us nothing 

as to mr dana  if it were not for the necessity of drawing bills in
his favor  we should hardly be acquainted with his existence  it is
commonly said  that republics are better informed than monarchs of the
state of their foreign affairs  and that they insist upon a greater
degree of vigilance and punctuality in their ministers  we  on the
contrary  seem to have adopted a new system  the ignorance  in which
we are kept  of every interesting event  renders it impossible for the
sovereign to instruct their servants  and of course forms them into an
independent privy council for the direction of their affairs  without
their advice or concurrence  i can hardly express to you what i feel
on this occasion  i blush when i meet a member of congress  who
inquires into what is passing in europe  when the general applies to
me for advice on the same subject  which must regulate his movements 
i am compelled to inform him  that we have no intelligence but what he
has seen in the papers  the following is an extract of his last
letter to me   but how does it happen  that all our information of
what is transacting in europe should come to hand through indirect
channels  or from the enemy  or does this question proceed from my
unacquaintedness with facts  

but let me dismiss a subject  which gives me so much pain  in the hope
that we shall in future have no further cause of complaint 

since the evacuation of savannah  the enemy have by the general orders
contained in the enclosed papers  announced the proposed evacuation of
charleston  we are in daily expectation of hearing  therefore  that
tranquillity is restored to the southern states  several circumstances
lead us to suppose  that they entertain thoughts of abandoning new
york sometime this fall  you _only_ can inform us  whether this step
has been taken in consequence of any expectations they entertain of a
general peace  or with a view to pursue the system  which the present
administration appears to have adopted  when they so loudly reprobate
the american war  and whether  by withdrawing their troops from hence
they only mean to collect their force and direct it against our
allies  this knowledge would render such an alteration in our system
necessary  that it affords us new reasons for regretting our want of
information on these important points 

the marquis de vaudreuil has unfortunately lost the magnifique  sunk
by running on a rock in the harbor of boston  where he is now  with
the remainder of his fleet  except three refitting at portsmouth 
consisting of twelve sail of the line  this has enabled congress to
show their attention to his most christian majesty  and their wish to
promote his interests as far as their circumstances will permit  by
presenting him the america  of seventyfour guns  enclosed are their
resolves on that subject  and the answer given by the minister of
france  the ship is in such a state  that she may by diligence be
refitted for sea in about two months  and from the accounts i hear of
her  she will i believe prove a fine ship  the general is collecting
the army  the last division of the french troops marched from here
this morning  when collected  they will  i presume  repair to their
old post  at the white plains  and perhaps endeavor to accelerate the
departure of the enemy 

i am sorry you did not pursue your first design  and enlarge in your
letter upon the subjects  which you imagined would be discussed in the
negotiations for peace  it might have changed our sentiments  and
altered our views on some points  two things are of great moment to
us  one of which at least would meet with no difficulty  if france and
england understand their true interests  i mean the west india trade 
and the right to cut logwood and mahogany  without a free admission of
all kinds of provisions into the islands  our agriculture will suffer
extremely  this will be severely felt at first  and when it remedies
itself  which it will do in time  it must be at the expense of the
nations that share our commerce  it will lessen the consumption of
foreign sugars  increase the supplies which the poorer people among us
draw from the maple   c  and by reducing the price of provision  and
rendering the cultivation of lands less profitable  make
proportionable increase of our own manufactures  and lessen our
dependence on europe  this will  i must confess  in some measure check
our population  and so far i regard it as an evil  the merchants and
farmers  if precluded at a peace from the advantages  which this
commerce gave them while connected with england        3  then a
variety of arguments on this subject  arising as well from the general
interests of france  as from her political connexion with us  might be
urged to show the wisdom of adopting the same liberal sentiments on
this point  which has of late distinguished her in so many others  but
if she should not be able to overcome her ancient prejudices  i
believe they will be found to have less influence on the british  whom
you will press earnestly on this head  besides the general interest of
the kingdom  there is with them a powerful west india interest  to
plead in behalf of a free importation of provisions into their
islands  if i mistake not  the present wishes of the nation  as well
as the professions of administration  lead to every measure  which may
wear away our present resentments  and strengthen the connexion
between us and them 

the logwood trade we have some claim to  from our continued exercise
of the right  nor can england pretend to exclude us from it  without
invalidating her own title  which stands upon the same ground  if
spain admits the right in england  she gains nothing by excluding us 
since in proportion as she diminishes our commerce in that article 
she increases that of great britain  other manufacturing nations are
interested in exciting a competition between us at their markets 

when you write to me  be pleased to be very particular in your
relation of every step  which leads to a negotiation  everything of
this kind must be interesting 

  i have the honor to be  sir 
                                                 robert r  livingston

  sir 

in consequence of the notice i have just now had from mr jay of your
desire of an extract from my last letter from the secretary of state 
regarding the proposed treaty on the subject of american affairs  and
my authority in relation thereto  i take the liberty to send the same
enclosed  which  together with the powers contained in the commission 
which i had the honor of laying before you and mr jay  i am hopeful
will satisfy you of the willingness and sincere desire of his majesty
to give you entire content on that important subject 

this extract i would have sent before now  if i had thought you wished
to have it before i had the honor of waiting on you myself  which was
only delayed until i should be informed by mr jay  that you were well

  sir 

i have received the honor of yours  dated the 5th instant  enclosing
an extract of a letter to your excellency  from the right honorable
thomas townshend  one of his majesty s principal secretaries of state 
wherein your conduct in communicating to us the fourth article of
your instructions appears to have been approved by his majesty  i
suppose  therefore  that there is no impropriety in my requesting a
copy of that instruction  and if you see none  i wish to receive it
from you  hoping it may be of use in removing some of the difficulties
that obstruct our proceeding  4 

with great and sincere esteem  i am  sir  your excellency s most
obedient and most humble servant

   4  copy of the fourth article of his majesty s instructions to
  richard oswald  for his government in treating with the commissioners
  of the thirteen united colonies of america for a truce or peace  the
  said instructions being dated the 31st day of july  1782  viz 

   4th article  in case you find the american commissioners are not at
  liberty to treat on any terms short of independence  you are to
  declare to them  that you have authority to make that concession  our
  ardent wish for peace  disposing us to purchase it at the price of
  acceding to the complete independence of the thirteen colonies

  my lord 

a long and severe indisposition has delayed my acknowledging the
receipt of the letter your lordship did me the honor of writing to me
by mr fitzherbert 

you do me justice in believing  that i agree with you in earnestly
wishing the establishment of an honorable and lasting peace  and i am
happy to be assured by your lordship  that it is the system of the
ministers with whom you are co operating  i know it to be the sincere
desire of the united states  and with such dispositions on both sides
there is reason to hope  that the good work in its progress will meet
with little difficulty  a small one has occurred in the commencement 
with which mr oswald will acquaint you  i flatter myself that means
will be found on your part for removing it  and my best endeavors in
removing the subsequent ones  if any should arise  may be relied on 

i had the honor of being known to your lordship s father  on several
occasions he manifested a regard for me  and a confidence in me  i
shall be happy if my conduct in the present important business may
procure me the same rank in the esteem of his worthy successor 

i am  with sincere respect  my lord  your lordship s most obedient and
most humble servant

  sir 

i have nothing to add to mine of the 5th instant  but to congratulate
you on the safe arrival of two vessels from holland  having on board
the goods left by commodore gillon  and to present you in the name of
mr paine  with three copies of a late work of his addressed to the
abbé raynal  in which he takes notice of some of the many errors with
which his work abounds  the abbé has a fine imagination  and he
indulges it  the enclosed resolution contains an important fact  which
i am using means to ascertain  but from the ill success i have
hitherto met with in every similar attempt  i am fearful that it will
be very long before i can effect it 

i have the honor to be  sir  with great respect and esteem  your most
obedient humble servant

  sir 

since writing the above  i have received the enclosed resolutions of
congress  i have already anticipated all that can be said upon the
subject of the last  the melancholy tale of our necessities is
sufficiently known to you  it has been too often repeated to need
recitation 

mr morris  who writes from an empty treasury amidst perpetual duns 
will speak more feelingly  in short  money must be obtained for us at
any rate  whether we have peace or war  france having already done
much for us  and it not being probable that we shall extend our
demands beyond the present  she may think it wise not to let us open
accounts with a new banker  since the debtor is always more or less
under obligations to the creditor 

i have the honor to be  sir  with respect and esteem

  my dear friend 

since those acknowledged in my last  i have received your several
favors of august the 16th  20th  and 26th  i have been a long time
afflicted with the gravel and gout  which have much indisposed me for
writing  i am even now in pain  but will no longer delay some answer 

i did not perfectly comprehend the nature of your appointment
respecting the refugees  and i supposed you would in a subsequent
letter explain it  but  as i now find you have declined the service 
such explanation is become unnecessary 

i did receive the paper you inquire about  entitled _preliminaries_ 
and dated may  1782  but it was from you  and i know nothing of their
having been communicated to this court  the third proposition   that
in case the negotiation between great britain and the allies of
america should not succeed  but the war continue between them  america
should act and be treated as a neutral nation   appeared at first
sight inadmissible  being contrary to our treaty  the truce too seems
not to have been desired by any of the parties 

with unalterable esteem and affection  i am  my dear friend  ever
yours   c

  sir 

just after closing my despatches  i was favored with yours of the 25th
of april  and the 25th and 29th of june  the ships that brought them
were so unfortunate as to be chased into the delaware by a superior
force  the eagle was driven ashore and sunk  the papers and money were
however happily saved  and part of the crew  but captain la fouche 
not having been since heard of  is supposed to be taken  the other
frigate has arrived safe  with all the passengers of both ships 

as i am just about to leave town for a short time  i will not touch
upon the important subject mentioned in your letters  which will on
account of my absence be committed to a special committee 

i would only observe to you  that the resolution in my last shows the
sense of congress on the subject of money matters 

you will see by the annexed resolutions  that congress have refused to
accept mr laurens s resignation  and that they have made some
alteration in your powers 

i send the papers  which contain the little news we have  and am  sir

  sir 

i received  on saturday last  your packets of the 10th and 11th of
this month 

a meeting of the king s confidential servants was held as soon as
possible  to consider the contents of them  and it was at once agreed
to make the alteration in the commission proposed by dr franklin and
mr jay  i trust that the readiness with which this proposal has been
accepted  will be considered as an ample testimony of the openness and
sincerity with which the government of this country is disposed to
treat with the americans 

the commission is passing with as much despatch as the forms of office
will allow  but i thought it material that no delay should happen  in
giving you notice of the determination of his majesty s council upon
this subject  you will receive the commission very soon after this
reaches you 

  i am  with great regard   c

  sir 

i have the honor to send you my despatches for the chevalier de la
luzerne  the packet is voluminous  but it contains many duplicates 

i should be glad if it were in my power to inform him  that our treaty
is in as good progress as yours  but this is far from being the case 
i cannot even foresee what will be the issue  for difficulties
multiply  it will be well for you to forewarn the congress to be
prepared for whatever event may arise  i do not despair  i the rather
hope  but as yet all is uncertainty

  sir 

i have just received your no  15  dated the 9th of august  which
mentions your not having heard from me since march  i have  however 
written sundry letters  viz  of april the 8th  and june the 12th  june
the 25th and 29th  august the 12th  and september the 3d  and sent
copies of the same  which i hope cannot all have miscarried 

the negotiations for peace have hitherto amounted to little more than
mutual professions of sincere desires   c   being obstructed by the
want of due form in the english commissions appointing their
plenipotentiaries  the objections made to those for treating with
france  spain and holland were first removed  and by the enclosed 5 
it seems that our objections to that for treating with us will now be
removed also  so that we expect to begin in a few days our
negotiations  but there are so many interests to be considered and
settled  in a peace between five different nations  that it will be
well not to flatter ourselves with a very speedy conclusion 

i mentioned  in a former letter  my having communicated to count de
vergennes the state of american commerce  which you sent me  and my
having urged its consideration   c  enclosed is a copy of a letter
received from that minister on the subject 

the copy of general carleton s letter  and the bills of exchange 
which you mentioned as enclosed  do not appear  i hope soon to have a
better opportunity of writing  when i shall be fuller 

  with great esteem   c

  my dear friend 

i only write one line to you  to let you know that i am not forgetful
of you  or of our common concerns  i have not heard anything from the
ministry yet  i believe it is a kind of vacation with them  before the
meeting of parliament  i have told you of a proposition  which i have
had some thoughts to make as a kind of copartnership in commerce  i
send you a purposed temporary convention  which i have drawn up  you
are to consider it only as one i recommend  the words underlined are
grafted upon the proposition of my memorial  dated may 19th  1778  you
will see the principle  which i have in my thoughts to extend for the
purpose of restoring our ancient copartnership generally 

i cannot tell you what event things may take  but my thoughts are
always employed in endeavoring to arrange that system upon which the
_china vase_  lately shattered  may be cemented together  upon
principles of compact and connexion  instead of dependence 

i have met with a sentiment in this country which gives some alarm 
viz  lest the unity of government in america should be uncertain  and
the states reject the authority of congress  some passages in general
washington s letter have given weight to these doubts  i do not hear
of any tendency to this opinion  _that the american states will break
to pieces  and then we may still conquer them_  i believe all that
folly is extinguished  but many serious and well disposed persons are
alarmed  lest _this should be the ill fated moment for relaxing the
powers of the union  and annihilating the cement of confederation_ 
 _vide_ washington s letter   and that great britain should thereby
lose her best and wisest hope of being reconnected with the american
states _unitedly_  i should for one think it the greatest misfortune 
pray give me some opinion upon this 

you see there is likewise another turn  which may be given to this
sentiment by intemperate and disappointed people  who may indulge a
passionate revenge for their own disappointments  by endeavoring to
excite general distrust  discord  and disunion  i wish to be prepared
and guarded at all points 

i beg my best compliments to your colleagues  be so good as to show
this letter to them  i beg particularly my condolence  and i hope
congratulation  to mr adams  i hear that he has been very dangerously
ill  but that he is again recovered  i hope the latter part is true 
and that we shall all survive to set our hands to some future compacts
of common interest  and common affection  between our two countries 

  your ever affectionate

  sir 

i have but just received information of this opportunity  and have
only time allowed to write a few lines 

in my last of the 26th past  i mentioned that the negotiation for
peace had been obstructed  by the want of due form in the english
commissions appointing their plenipotentiaries  in that for treating
with us  the mentioning our states by their public name had been
avoided  which we objected to  another is come  of which i send a copy
enclosed  we have now made several preliminary propositions  which the
english minister  mr oswald  has approved  and sent to his court  he
thinks they will be approved there  but i have some doubts  in a few
days  however  the answer expected will determine  by the first of
these articles  the king of great britain renounces for himself and
successors  all claim and pretension to dominion or territory within
the thirteen united states  and the boundaries are described as in our
instructions  except that the line between nova scotia and new england
is to be settled by commissioners after the peace  by another article 
the fishery in the american seas is to be freely exercised by the
americans  wherever they might formerly exercise it while united with
great britain  by another  the citizens and subjects of each nation
are to enjoy the same protection and privileges  in each others  ports
and countries  respecting commerce  duties   c  that are enjoyed by
native subjects  the articles are drawn up very fully by mr jay  who i
suppose sends you a copy  if not  it will go by the next opportunity 
if these articles are agreed to  i apprehend little difficulty in the
rest  something has been mentioned about the refugees and english
debts  but not insisted on  as we declared at once  that whatever
confiscations had been made in america  being in virtue of the laws of
particular states  the congress had no authority to repeal those laws 
and therefore could give us none to stipulate for such repeal 

i have been honored with the receipt of your letters  nos 14 and 15  i
have also received two letters from mr lewis r  morris  both dated
the 6th of july  and one dated the 10th of august  enclosing bills for

          68 290 livres 
          71 380
           9 756
                
  in all 149 426 livres 

being intended for the payment of ministers  salaries for the two
first quarters of this year  but as these bills came so late  that all
those salaries were already paid  i shall make no use of the bills 
but lay them by till further orders  and the salaries of different
ministers not having all the same times of falling due  as they had
different commencements  i purpose to get all their accounts settled
and reduced to the same period  and send you the state of them  that
you may be clear in future orders  i see in one of the estimates sent
me  that a quarter s salary of a minister is reckoned at 14 513
livres  in the other it is reckoned 16 667 livres  and the bill for
9 756 6  livres is mentioned as intended to pay a balance due on the
remittance of the 68 290 livres  being unacquainted with the state of
your exchange  i do not well comprehend this  and therefore leave the
whole for the present  as i have said above  permit me only to hint
for your consideration  whether it may not be well hereafter to omit
mention of sterling  in our appointments  since we have severed from
the country to which that denomination of money is peculiar  and also
to order the payment of your ministers in such a manner  that they may
know exactly what they are to receive  and not be subject to the
fluctuations of exchange  if it is that  which occasions the
difference between 14 583 for the first quarter  and the 16 667 for
the second  it is considerable  i think we have no right to any
advantage by the exchange  nor should we be liable to any loss from
it  hitherto we have taken 15 000 for a quarter   subject however to
the allowance or disallowance of congress  which is lower than the
medium between those two extremes 

the different accounts given of lord shelburne s character  with
respect to sincerity  induced the ministry here to send over m  de
rayneval  secretary to the council  to converse with him  and endeavor
to form by that means a more perfect judgment of what was to be
expected from the negotiations  he was five or six days in england 
saw all the ministers  and returned quite satisfied  that they are
sincerely desirous of peace  so that the negotiations now go on with
some prospect of success  but the court and people of england are very
changeable  a little turn of fortune in their favor sometimes turns
their heads  and i shall not think a speedy peace to be depended on 
till i see the treaties signed  i am obliged to finish 

with great esteem   c

  sir 

a long and painful illness has prevented my corresponding with your
excellency regularly 

mr jay has  i believe  acquainted you with the obstructions our peace
negotiations have met with  and that they are at length removed  by
the next courier expected from london  we may be able perhaps to form
some judgment of the probability of success  so far as relates to our
part of the peace  how likely the other powers are to settle their
pretensions  i cannot yet learn  in the mean time  america is
gradually growing more easy  by the enemy s evacuation of their posts 
as you will see by some intelligence i enclose 

with great respect  i have the honor to be   c

as mr strachey is going from hence to paris  with some particulars for
mr oswald  which were not easily to be explained in writing  i take
the liberty of introducing him to your acquaintance  though i am not
sure that he is not a little known to you  the confidential situation
in which he stands with me  makes me particularly desirous of
presenting him to you 

i believe  sir  i am enough known to you  for you to believe me  when
i say  that there has not been from the beginning a single person more
averse to the unhappy war  or who wishes more earnestly than i do  for
a return of peace and mutual amity between great britain and america 

i am  with great regard  sir  your most obedient humble servant

i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me by mr
strachey  and was much pleased with the opportunity it gave me of
renewing and increasing my acquaintance with a gentleman of so amiable
and deserving a character 

i am sensible you have ever been averse to the measures that brought
on this unhappy war  i have  therefore  no doubt of the sincerity of
your wishes for a return of peace  mine are equally earnest  nothing 
therefore  except the beginning of the war  has given me more concern
than to learn at the conclusion of our conferences  that it is not
likely to be soon ended  be assured  no endeavors on my part would be
wanting to remove any difficulties that may have arisen  or even if a
peace were made  to procure afterwards any changes in the treaty that
might tend to render it more perfect  and the peace more durable  but
we  who are here at so great a distance from our constituents  have
not the possibility of obtaining in a few days fresh instructions  as
is the case with your negotiators  and are therefore obliged to insist
on what is conformable to those we have  and at the same time appears
to us just and reasonable 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be  sir   c

  sir 

the baron de kermelin  a swedish gentleman of distinction  recommended
strongly to me by his excellency  the ambassador of that nation to
this court  as a person highly esteemed in his own  purposes a journey
through north america  to view its natural productions  acquaint
himself with its commerce  and acquire such information as may be
useful to his country  in the communication and connexion of interests
that seem to be growing  and probably may soon become considerable
between the two nations  i therefore beg leave to introduce him to
you  and request that you would present him to the president of
congress  and to such other persons as you shall think may be useful
to him in his views  and i recommend him earnestly to those
civilities  which you have a pleasure in showing to strangers of
merit 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

mr stewart  informing me that he shall set out tomorrow for paris 
will be the bearer of this  and duplicates of my last letters  the
want of time will prevent my sending mr jay duplicates of the
resolutions formerly enclosed to him  which will be the more
unnecessary as you will communicate those you receive with this  if my
former letters containing them  have not reached him 

we are much flattered by the proposals of sweden  and feel all the
force of its minister s observations  every new acknowledgment lays
the foundation of others  and familiarizes great britain with the idea
of acknowledging us as sovereign and independent  i feel some
pleasure  too  in thinking that you are to be the instrument of
procuring us new connexions  and beg leave to remind you of another
which calls upon your attention  though it seems to have been
forgotten in the hurry of business  i mean that with the states of
barbary  the good dispositions of the court of france towards us  and
the enlarged policy by which their measures are actuated  together
with the coolness that at present subsists between the emperor of
morocco and great britain   if we are well informed  seem to point out
this as the favorable moment for making ourselves known to him  as mr
jay is now with you  i wish you would consult upon the means of
bringing this about  so that we may not be shut out of the
mediterranean in future 

i know you will start a very obvious objection  but as this can only
be removed by your influence where you now are  we rely upon you for
the means as well as for the manner of treating  i have not thought it
necessary to say anything to congress on this subject  nor shall i 
till you give me hopes that something may be done in it 

the only political object of a general nature  that has been touched
upon in congress since my last  is the exchange of prisoners  which
seems at present to be as far as ever from being effected  the
propositions on the side of the enemy were to exchange seamen for
soldiers  they having no soldiers in their hands  that the soldiers so
exchanged should not serve for one year against the united states 
that the sailors might go into immediate service  that the remainder
of the soldiers in our hands should be given up at a stipulated price 

congress rejected this proposal as unequal  as letting loose a force 
which might be employed against our allies in the west indies  as
making no provision for the payment of the large balance due to us for
the maintenance of prisoners  they further required  that general
carleton should explicitly declare  that the powers he gives to his
commissioners for negotiating an exchange are derived from the king of
great britain  so that any engagement for the payment of the debt they
have incurred may be considered as binding upon the nation  with
respect to mr laurens  they have come to no decided opinion  the
committee to whom it was referred  reporting that 

 with respect to the information contained in the extract of sir guy
carleton s and admiral digby s letter of the 2d of august   _that
after mr laurens was discharged  he declared that he considered lord
cornwallis as freed from his parole_   your committee conceive it
sufficient to observe  that no intimation having been received of such
a fact  except  from the said extract  and congress having given no
directions to that purpose  the consideration thereof would in their
opinion be premature  and ought therefore to be deferred   since
which  though letters have been received from mr laurens  they have
come to no resolution  unless their direction to him to proceed in the
business of his mission may be considered as such 

general carleton has sent out the trial of lippincott  which admits
the murder of huddy  but justifies lippincott under an _irregular_
order of the board of refugees  so paltry a palliation of so black a
crime would not have been admitted  and captain asgill would certainly
have paid the forfeit for the injustice of his countrymen  had not the
interposition of their majesties prevented  the letter from the count
de vergennes is made the groundwork of the resolution passed on that
subject  i shall transmit you the resolve 

i suppose i need not tell you  that the enemy contrived to get off the
eagle and to carry her  to new york  you will find  in the enclosed
papers  a very polite letter from captain elphingston  it is easier to
be so in word than in deed among the british  digby has refused to
permit him to comply with his engagement  at least so far as his share
of the prize is concerned  and insists upon dividing the baggage of
the officers  and sharing the eighth pair of breeches   c 

on the 4th instant  mr boudinot was elected president in the room of
mr hanson  whose term of service had expired  mr lewis morris will
enclose bills purchased here at six shillings and three pence 
currency  for five livres  to the amount of your last quarter s
salary  ending the first of october 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

congress a few days since  passed the enclosed resolution  no  1  by
which they have added mr jefferson to the commission for concluding a
peace  the established character of this gentleman gives me reason to
hope  that his appointment will be very acceptable to you  and the
other gentlemen in the commission  i have not yet learned whether he
will take the task upon him  but i have reason to believe he will  the
death of his wife having lessened  in the opinion of his friends  the
reluctance which he has hitherto manifested to going abroad  i think
it would be proper to make a formal annunciation of this resolution to
the court of france  you will naturally give such a representation of
mr jefferson s character  as will secure to him there that esteem and
confidence which he justly merits  the resolution  no  2  needs no
comment  or if it does  mr morris will prove the able commentator  i
resign the task to him 

for what end are the show of negotiations kept up by england  when
peace upon the only terms she can possibly expect to obtain it is far
from her heart  her ministers  like some ministers of the gospel  who
are unwilling to quit the pulpit when they have tired out their
hearers  expect to keep the people together by calling out at every
period   now to conclude   while they continue the same dull tale for
want of skill to wind it up 

by accounts from jamaica  we learn that the british have recovered
most of their settlements on the bay  some attention will  i hope  be
paid in the treaty of peace to secure to us the share we formerly had
in the logwood trade  it was a valuable remittance to us  and the low
price at which we were enabled to sell renders it important to other
nations  that we should not be excluded from furnishing it as usual 
you will find by the enclosed paper  that mr burgess  an english
merchant  was not permitted to settle at boston and obtain the rights
of citizenship  upon principles which must be alarming to england  it
shows at the same time the respect that is paid to the resolutions of
congress  notwithstanding all that has been said and written to prove
the contrary

_p  s _ i forgot to mention  that i am solicited by mr barlow to
transmit to you proposals for printing a work of his  which you will
find described in the enclosed proposals  as they are accompanied with
a specimen of his poetry  which is as much as i have seen of it  you
will judge yourself how far it deserves the patronage he wishes you to
give it

                                           passy  november 26th  1782 

  sir 

you may well remember  that in the beginning of our conferences 
before the other commissioners arrived  on your mentioning to me a
retribution for the royalists  whose estates had been confiscated  i
acquainted you that nothing of that kind could be stipulated by us 
the confiscation being made by virtue of laws of particular states 
which the congress had no power to contravene or dispense with  and
therefore could give us no such authority in our commission  and i
gave it as my opinion and advice  honestly and cordially  that if a
reconciliation was intended  no mention should be made in our
negotiations of those people  for they having done infinite mischief
to our properties  by wantonly burning and destroying farm houses 
villages  and towns  if compensation for their losses were insisted
on  we should certainly exhibit again such an account of all the
ravages they had committed  which would necessarily recall to view
scenes of barbarity that must inflame  instead of conciliating  and
tend to perpetuate an enmity that we all profess a desire of
extinguishing  understanding  however  from you  that this was a point
your ministry had at heart  i wrote concerning it to congress  and i
have lately received the following resolution  viz 

         _by the united states  in congress assembled _ 

                                                 september 10th  1782 

      resolved  that the secretary for foreign affairs be  and he is
     hereby directed to obtain  as speedily as possible  authentic
     returns of the slaves and other property  which have been carried
     off or destroyed in the course of the war by the enemy  and to
     transmit the same to the ministers plenipotentiary for
     negotiating peace 

      resolved  that  in the meantime  the secretary for foreign
     affairs inform the said ministers  that many thousands of slaves 
     and other property  to a very great amount  have been carried
     off  or destroyed by the enemy  and that in the opinion of
     congress  the great loss of property  which the citizens of the
     united states have sustained by the enemy  will be considered by
     the several states as an insuperable bar to their making
     restitution or indemnification to the former owner of property 
     which has been  or may be forfeited to  or confiscated by any of
     the states  

in consequence of these resolutions and circular letters of the
secretary  the assembly of pennsylvania  then sitting  passed the
following act  viz 

            _state of pennsylvania  in general assembly _ 

                                      wednesday  september 18th  1782 

 the bill  entitled  an act for procuring an estimate of the damages
sustained by the inhabitants of pennsylvania  from the troops and
adherents of the king of great britain during the present war   was
read a second time 

 ordered to be transcribed  and printed for public consideration 

  extract from the minutes 

                                                       peter z  lloyd 

                                     _clerk of the general assembly _ 

 whereas great damages  of the most wanton nature  have been committed
by the armies of the king of great britain  or their adherents within
the territory of the united states of north america  unwarranted by
the practice of civilized nations  and only to be accounted for from
the vindictive spirit of the said king and his officers  and whereas
an accurate account and estimate of such damages  more especially the
waste and destruction of property  may be very useful to the people of
the united states of america  in forming a future treaty of peace 
and  in the meantime  may serve to exhibit in a true light to the
nations of europe the conduct of the said king  his ministers 
officers  and adherents  to the end  therefore  that proper measures
be taken to ascertain the damages aforesaid  which have been done to
the citizens and inhabitants of pennsylvania  in the course of the
present war within this state  be it enacted by the house of
representatives of the freemen of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  in
general assembly met  and by the authority of the same  that in every
county of this state  which has been invaded by the armies  soldiers 
or adherents of the king of great britain  the commissioners of every
such county shall immediately meet together  each within their county 
and issue directions to the assessors of the respective townships 
districts  and places within such county  to call upon the inhabitants
of every township and place  to furnish accounts and estimates of the
damages  waste  spoil  and destruction  which have been done and
committed as aforesaid  upon the property  real or personal  within
the same township or place  since the first day of     which was in
the year of our lord 177   and the same accounts and estimates to be
transmitted to the commissioners without delay  and if any person or
persons shall refuse or neglect to make out such accounts and
estimates  the said assessors of the township or place shall  from
their own knowledge  and by any other reasonable and lawful method 
take and render such an account and estimate of all damage done or
committed  as aforesaid  provided always  that all such accounts and
estimates to be made out and transmitted as aforesaid  shall contain a
narrative of the time and circumstances  and if in the power of the
person aggrieved  the names of the general  or other officers or
adherents of the enemy by whom the damage in any case was done  or
under whose orders the army  detachment  party  or persons  committing
the same  acted at that time  and also the name and condition of the
person or persons  whose property was so damaged or destroyed  and
that all such accounts and estimates be made in current money  upon
oath or affirmation of the sufferer  or of others having knowledge
concerning the same  and that in every case it be set forth  whether
the party injured hath received any satisfaction for his loss  and by
whom the same was given 

 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that the said
commissioners  having obtained the said accounts and estimates from
the assessor of the several townships and places  shall proceed to
inspect and register the same in a book  to be provided for that
purpose  distinguishing the districts and townships  and entering
those of each place together  and if any account and estimate be
imperfect  or not sufficiently verified and established  the said
commissioners shall have power  and they  or any two of them  are
hereby authorised to summon and compel any person  whose evidence they
shall think necessary  to appear before them at a day and place
appointed  to be summoned upon oath or affirmation  concerning any
damage or injury as aforesaid  and the said commissioners shall  upon
the call and demand of the president  or vice president of the supreme
executive council  deliver  or send to the secretary of the said
council  all or any of the original accounts and estimates aforesaid 
and shall also deliver  or send to the said secretary  copies of the
book aforesaid  or any part or parts thereof  upon reasonable notice 
and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that all losses
of negro or mulatto slaves and servants  who have been deluded and
carried away by the enemies of the united states  and who have not
been recovered or recompensed  shall be comprehended within the
accounts and estimates aforesaid  and that the commissioners and
assessors of any county  which had not been invaded as aforesaid 
shall nevertheless inquire after  and procure accounts and estimates
of any damages suffered by the loss of such servants and slaves  as is
herein before directed as to other property 

 and be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid  that the
charges and expenses of executing this act  as to the pay of the said
commissioners and assessors  shall be as in other cases  and that
witnesses shall be rewarded for their loss of time and trouble  as
witnesses summoned to appear in the courts of quarter sessions of the
peace  and the said charges and expenses shall be defrayed by the
commonwealth  but paid  in the first instance  out of the hands of the
treasurer of the county  for county rates  and levies upon orders
drawn by the commissioners of the proper county  

we have not yet had time to hear what has been done by the other
assemblies  but i have no doubt that similar acts will be made use of
by all of them  and that the mass of evidence produced by the
execution of those acts  not only of the enormities committed by those
people  under the direction of the british generals  but of those
committed by the british troops themselves  will form a record that
must render the british name odious in america to the latest
generations  in that authentic record will be found the burning of the
fine towns of charlestown  near boston  of falmouth  just before
winter  when the sick  the aged  the women and children  were driven
to seek shelter where they could hardly find it  of norfolk  in the
midst of winter  of new london  of fairfield  of esopus   c  besides
near a hundred and fifty miles of well settled country laid waste 
every house and barn burnt  and many hundreds of farmers  with their
wives and children  butchered and scalped 

the present british ministers  when they reflect a little  will
certainly be too equitable to suppose  that their nation has a right
to make an unjust war   which they have always allowed this against us
to be   and do all sorts of unnecessary mischief  unjustifiable by the
practice of any individual people  which those they make war with are
to suffer without claiming any satisfaction  but that if britons  or
their adherents  are in return deprived of any property  it is to be
restored to them  or they are to be indemnified  the british troops
can never excuse their barbarities  they were unprovoked  the
loyalists may say in excuse of theirs  that they were exasperated by
the loss of their estates  and it was revenge  they have then had
their revenge  _is it right they should have both _

some of those people may have merit in their regard for britain  and
who espoused her cause from affection  these it may become you to
reward  but there are many of them who were waverers  and were only
determined to engage in it by some occasional circumstance or
appearances  these have not much of either merit or demerit  and there
are others  who have abundance of demerit respecting your country 
having by their falsehoods and misrepresentations brought on and
encouraged the continuance of the war  these  instead of being
recompensed  should be punished 

it is usual among christian people at war to profess always a desire
of peace  but if the ministers of one of the parties choose to insist
particularly on a certain article  which they have known the others
are not and cannot be empowered to agree to  what credit can they
expect should be given to such professions 

your ministers require that we should receive again into our bosom
those who have been our bitterest enemies  and restore their
properties who have destroyed ours  and this  while the wounds they
have given us are still bleeding  it is many years since your nation
expelled the stuarts and their adherents  and confiscated their
estates  much of your resentment against them may by this time be
abated  yet  if we should propose it  and insist on it as an article
of our treaty with you  that that family should be recalled and the
forfeited estates of its friends restored  would you think us serious
in our progressions of earnestly desiring peace 

i must repeat my opinion  that it is best for you to drop all mention
of the refugees  we have proposed  indeed  nothing but what we think
best for you as well as ourselves  but if you will have them
mentioned  let it be in an article  in which you may provide  that
they shall exhibit accounts of their losses to the commissioners 
hereafter to be appointed  who should examine the same  together with
the accounts now preparing in america of the damages done by them  and
state the account  and that if a balance appears in their favor  it
shall be paid by us to you  and by you divided among them as you shall
think proper  and if the balance is found due to us  it shall be paid
by you 

give me leave  however  to advise you to prevent the necessity of so
dreadful a discussion by dropping the article  that we may write to
america and stop the inquiry 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

an opportunity offering from this port to write directly to you  i do
not choose to hazard anything by the post  which carries this to
boston  particularly as i did not hear till just now  that a frigate
was to sail from thence  and it is uncertain whether this will arrive
in time to go by her  this then only accompanies the newspapers  which
contain all the public information now in circulation 

the memorials of messrs la marque and fabru are transmitted to south
carolina  as it is a matter in which the united states are not
concerned  it is to be hoped  that the state will do justice to the
claimants  if  as asserted  gillon acted under authority from them  he
has just left this with his ship  not in the most honorable manner 
having  as i am informed  been arrested by order of the proprietor of
the ship for his proportion of the prize money  the sheriff stands in
the gap 

the swiss officer mentioned in yours  i have sent to edenton to get
information about  you shall have the result of inquiries in my next 

as your grandson will probably choose to continue in the line he is
in  i cannot but think he might find important advantages from opening
a correspondence with this office  his diligence and accuracy in
collecting and transmitting intelligence would procure him friends
here  my attachment to you will render me desirous to place them in

we detain the washington a little longer  expecting an english
passport for her in a few days  and as possibly some vessel bound for
north america may sail before her  i write this line to inform you 
that the french preliminaries with england are not yet signed  though
we hope they may be very soon  of ours i enclose a copy  the dutch and
spain have yet made but little progress  and as no definitive treaty
will be signed till all are agreed  there may be time for congress to
give us further instructions  if they think proper  we hope the terms
we have obtained will be satisfactory  though  to secure our main
points  we may have yielded too much in favor of the royalists  the
quantity of aid to be afforded us remains undecided  i suppose
something depends on the event of the treaty  by the washington you
will be fully informed of everything

i am honored by your several letters  nos 16  17  18 and 19  dated
september 5th  13th  15th  and 18th  i believe that the complaints you
make in them of my not writing  may ere now have appeared less
necessary  as many of my letters written before those complaints must
have since come to hand  i will nevertheless mention some of the
difficulties your ministers meet with  in keeping up a regular and
punctual correspondence  we are far from the seaports  and not well
informed  and often misinformed about the sailing of vessels 
frequently we are told they are to sail in a week or two  and often
they lie in the ports for months after  with our letters on board 
either waiting for convoy  or for other reasons  the post office here
is an unsafe conveyance  many of the letters we received by it have
evidently been opened  and doubtless the same happens to those we
send  and at this time particularly  there is so violent a curiosity
in all kinds of people to know something relating to the negotiations 
and whether peace may be expected  or a continuance of the war  that
there are few private hands or travellers  that we can trust with
carrying our despatches to the seacoast  and i imagine that they may
sometimes be opened and destroyed because they cannot be well sealed 
again  the observation you make  that the congress ministers in europe
seem to form themselves into a privy council  transacting affairs
without the privity or concurrence of the sovereign  may be in some
respects just  but it should be considered  that if they do not write
as frequently as other ministers here do to their respective courts 
or if when they write  their letters are not regularly received  the
greater distance of the seat of war  and the extreme irregularity of
conveyances may be the causes  and not a desire of acting without the
knowledge or orders of their constituents  there is no european court 
to which an express cannot be sent from paris in ten or fifteen days 
and from most of them answers may be obtained in that time  there is 
i imagine  no minister who would not think it safer to act by orders
than from his own discretion  and yet  unless you leave more to the
discretion of your ministers in europe than courts usually do  your
affairs may sometimes suffer extremely from the distance which  in the
time of war especially  may make it five or six months before the
answer to a letter shall be received  i suppose the minister from this
court will acquaint congress with the king s sentiments  respecting
their very handsome present of a ship of the line  people in general
here are much pleased with it 

i communicated  together with my memoir demanding a supply of money 
copies of every paragraph in your late letters  which express so
strongly the necessity of it  i have been constant in my solicitations
both directly  and through the marquis de lafayette  who has employed
himself diligently and warmly in the business  the negotiations for
peace are  i imagine  one cause of the great delay and indecision on
this occasion beyond what has been usual  as the quantum may be
different if those negotiations do or do not succeed  we have not yet
learnt what we may expect  we have been told that we shall be aided 
but it cannot be to the extent demanded  six millions have been
mentioned  but not as a sum fixed  the minister tells me still  that
he is working upon the subject  but cannot yet give a determinative
answer  i know his good will to do the best for us that is possible 

it is in vain for me to repeat again what i have so often written  and
what i find taken so little notice of  that there are bounds to
everything  and that the faculties of this nation are limited like
those of all other nations  some of you seem to have established as
maxims the suppositions  that france has money enough for all her
occasions  and all ours besides  and that if she does not supply us 
it is owing to her want of will  or to my negligence  as to the first 
i am sure it is not true  and to the second  i can only say i should
rejoice as much as any man in being able to obtain more  and i shall
also rejoice in the greater success of those who may take my place 
you desire to be very particularly acquainted with  every step which
tends to negotiation   i am  therefore  encouraged to send you the
first part of the journal  which accidents  and a long severe illness
interrupted  but which  from notes i have by me  may be continued if
thought proper  in its present state  it is hardly fit for the
inspection of congress  certainly not for public view  i confide it
therefore to your prudence 

the arrival of mr jay  mr adams  and mr laurens  has relieved me from
much anxiety  which must have continued  if i had been left to finish
the treaty alone  and it has given me the more satisfaction  as i am
sure the business has profited by their assistance 

much of the summer has been taken up in objecting against the powers
given by great britain  and in removing those objections  the not
using any expressions  that might imply an acknowledgment of our
independence  seemed at first industriously to be avowed  but our
refusing otherwise to treat  at length induced them to get over that
difficulty  and then we came to the point of making propositions 
those made by mr jay and me before the arrival of the other gentlemen 
you will find in the paper a  which was sent by the british
plenipotentiary to london for the king s consideration  after some
weeks  an under secretary  mr strachey  arrived  with whom we had much
contestation about the boundaries and other articles which he proposed
and we settled  some of which he carried to london  and returned with
the propositions  some adopted  others omitted or altered  and new
ones added  which you will see in paper b  we spent many days in
disputing  and at length agreed on and signed the preliminaries  which
you will see by this conveyance  the british minister struggled hard
for two points  that the favors granted to the royalists should be
extended  and all our fishery contracted  we silenced them on the
first  by threatening to produce an account of the mischief done by
those people  and as to the second  when they told us they could not
possibly agree to it as we requested it  and must refer it to the
ministry in london  we produced a new article to be referred at the
same time  with a note of facts in support of it  which you have 
c  8  apparently  it seemed  that to avoid the discussion of this 
they suddenly changed their minds  dropped the design of recurring to
london  and agreed to allow the fishery as demanded 

footnote 

   8  the papers alluded to in this letter will be found in the
  correspondence of the commissioners for negotiating peace 

you will find in the preliminaries some inaccurate and ambiguous
expressions  that want explanation  and which may be explained in the
definitive treaty  and as the british ministry excluded our
proposition relating to commerce  and the american prohibition of that
with england may not be understood to cease merely by our concluding a
treaty of peace  perhaps we may then  if the congress shall think fit
to direct it  obtain some compensation for the injuries done us as a
condition of our opening again the trade  every one of the present
british ministry has  while in the ministry  declared the war against
us as unjust  and nothing is clearer in reason  than that those who
injure others by an unjust war  should make full reparation  they
have stipulated too  in these preliminaries  that in evacuating our
towns  they shall carry off no plunder  which is a kind of
acknowledgment that they ought not to have done it before 

the reason given us for dropping the article relating to commerce 
was  that some statutes were in the way  which must be repealed before
a treaty of that kind could be well formed  and that this was a matter
to be considered in parliament 

they wanted to bring their boundary down to the ohio  and to settle
their loyalists in the illinois country  we did not choose such
neighbors 

we communicated all the articles  as soon as they were signed  to
count de vergennes   except the separate one  who thinks we have
managed well  and told me that we had settled what was most
apprehended as a difficulty in the work of a general peace  by
obtaining the declaration of our independency 

_december 14th _ i have this day learnt  that the principal
preliminaries between france and england are agreed on  to wit 

1st  france is to enjoy the right of fishing and drying on all the
west coast of newfoundland  down to cape ray  miquelon and st pierre
to be restored  and may be fortified 

2d  senegal remains to france  and goree to be restored  the gambia
entirely to england 

3d  all the places taken from france in the east indies to be
restored  with a certain quantity of territory round them 

4th  in the west indies  grenada and the grenadines  st christophers 
nevis and montserat  to be restored to england  st lucia to france 
dominique to remain with france  and st vincents to be neutralized 

5th  no commissioner at dunkirk 

the points not yet quite settled are the territory round the places in
the indies  and neutralization of st vincents  apparently these will
not create much difficulty 

holland has yet hardly done anything in her negotiation 

spain offers for gibraltar to restore west florida and the bahamas  an
addition is talked of the island of guadaloupe  which france will cede
to spain in exchange for the other half of hispaniola  and spain to
england  but england  it is said  chose rather porto rico  nothing yet
concluded 

as soon as i received the commission and instructions for treating
with sweden  i waited on the ambassador here  who told me he daily
expected a courier on that subject  yesterday he wrote a note to
acquaint me  that he would call on me today  having something to
communicate to me  being obliged to go to paris  i waited on him  when
he showed me the full powers he had just received  and i showed him
mine  we agreed to meet on wednesday next  exchange copies  and
proceed to business  his commission has some polite expressions in it 
to wit   that his majesty thought it for the good of his subjects to
enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states of
america  who had established their independence so justly merited by
their courage and constancy   or to that effect  i imagine this treaty
will be soon completed  if any difficulty should arise  i shall take
the advice of my colleagues 

i thank you for the copies of mr paine s letter to the abbé raynal 
which i have distributed to good hands  the errors we see in
histories of our times and affairs weaken our faith in ancient
history  m  hilliard d auberteuil has here written another history of
our revolution  which however he modestly calls _an essay_  and
fearing that there may be errors  and wishing to have them corrected 
that his second edition may be more perfect  he has brought me six
sets  which he desires me to put into such hands in america  as may be
good enough to render him and the public that service  i send them to
you for that purpose  by captain barney  desiring that one set may be
given to mr paine  and the rest where you please  there is a quarto
set in the parcel  which please to accept from me 

i have never learnt whether the box of books i sent to you  and the
press to mr thompson  were put on board the eagle or one of the
transports  if the former  perhaps you might easily purchase them at
new york  if the latter  you may still receive them among the goods
for congress  now shipping by mr barclay  if they are quite lost let
me know it  that i may replace them 

i have received several letters from your office with bills to pay
ministers  salaries  nothing has yet been done with those bills  but i
have paid mr laurens 20 000 livres 

i have this day signed a common letter to you drawn up by my
colleagues  which you will receive herewith  we have kept this vessel
longer for two things  a passport promised us from england  and a sum
to send in her  but she is likely to depart without both  being all of
us impatient that congress should receive early intelligence of our
proceedings  and for the money we may probably borrow a frigate 

i am now entering on my 78th year  public business has engrossed fifty
of them  i wish now to be  for the little time i have left  my own
master  if i live to see this peace concluded  i shall beg leave to
remind the congress of their promise then to dismiss me  i shall be
happy to sing with old simeon  _now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace  for mine eyes have seen thy salvation_

i have the honor to acquaint your excellency  that our courier is to
set out tomorrow at ten o clock  with the despatches we send to
congress  by the washington  captain barney  for which ship we have
got a passport from the king of england  9  if you would make any use
of this conveyance  the courier shall wait upon you tomorrow at
versailles  and receive your orders 

i hoped i might have been able to send part of the aids we have asked 
by this safe vessel  i beg that your excellency would at least inform
me what expectations i may give in my letters  i fear the congress
will be reduced to despair  when they find that nothing is yet
obtained

  sir 

i cannot but be surprised  sir  that after the explanation i have had
with you  and the promise you gave  that you would not press the
application for an english passport for the sailing of the packet
washington  that you now inform me  you have received the passport 
and that at ten o clock tomorrow morning your courier will set out to
carry your despatches  i am at a loss  sir  to explain your conduct
and that of your colleagues on this occasion  you have concluded your
preliminary articles without any communication between us  although
the instructions from congress prescribes  that nothing shall be done
without the participation of the king  you are about to hold out a
certain hope of peace to america  without even informing yourself on
the state of the negotiation on our part 

you are wise and discreet  sir  you perfectly understand what is due
to propriety  you have all your life performed your duties  i pray you
to consider how you propose to fulfil those  which are due to the
king  i am not desirous of enlarging these reflections  i commit them
to your own integrity  when you shall be pleased to relieve my
uncertainty  i will entreat the king to enable me to answer your
demands 

i have the honor to be  sir  with sincere regard  your very humble and
obedient servant

  sir 

i received the letter your excellency did me the honor of writing to
me on the 15th instant  the proposal of having a passport from england
was agreed to by me the more willingly  as i at that time had hopes of
obtaining some money to send in the washington  and the passport would
have made its transportation safer  with that of our despatches  and
of yours also  if you had thought fit to make use of the occasion 
your excellency objected  as i understood it  that the english
ministers by their letters sent in the same ship  might convey
inconvenient expectations into america  it was therefore i proposed
not to press for the passport  till your preliminaries were also
agreed to  they have sent the passport without being pressed to do it 
and they have sent no letters to go under it  and ours will prevent
the inconvenience apprehended  in a subsequent conversation your
excellency mentioned your intention of sending some of the king s
cutters  whence i imagined  that detaining the washington was no
longer necessary  and it was certainly incumbent on us to give
congress as early an account as possible of our proceedings  who will
think it extremely strange to hear of them by other means  without a
line from us  i acquainted your excellency  however  with our
intention of despatching that ship  supposing you might possibly have
something to send by her 

nothing has been agreed in the preliminaries contrary to the interests
of france  and no peace is to take place between us and england  till
you have concluded yours  your observation is  however  apparently
just  that in not consulting you before they were signed  we have been
guilty of neglecting a point of _bienséance_  but as this was not from
want of respect for the king  whom we all love and honor  we hope it
will be excused  and that the great work  which has hitherto been so
happily conducted  is so nearly brought to perfection  and is so
glorious to his reign  will not be ruined by a single indiscretion of
ours  and certainly the whole edifice sinks to the ground immediately 
if you refuse on that account to give us any further assistance 

we have not yet despatched the ship  and i beg leave to wait upon you
on friday for your answer 

it is not possible for any one to be more sensible than i am  of what
i and every american owe to the king  for the many and great benefits
and favors he has bestowed upon us  all my letters to america are
proofs of this  all tending to make the same impressions on the minds
of my countrymen  that i felt in my own  and i believe  that no prince
was ever more beloved and respected by his own subjects  than the king
is by the people of the united states  _the english  i just now
learn  flatter themselves they have already divided us _ i hope this
little misunderstanding will therefore be kept a secret  and that they
will find themselves totally mistaken 

with great and sincere respect  i am  sir  your excellency s most
obedient and most humble servant

  sir 

sundry circumstances occurring since mine of the 5th and 14th  have
hitherto retarded the departure of our despatches  they will now go
under the security of a british passport  be accompanied by a sum of
money  and by some further intelligence from england  which shows the
still unsettled state of minds there  and  together with the
difficulties and small progress in the dutch and spanish negotiations 
makes the speedy conclusion of peace still uncertain 

the swedish ambassador has exchanged full powers with me  i send a
copy of his herewith  we have had some conferences on the proposed
plan of our treaty  and he has despatched a courier for further
instructions respecting some of the articles 

the commissioners have joined in a letter to you  recommending the
consideration of a proposal from mr bridgen  relating to copper coin 
with this you have a copy of that proposal  and a sample of the
copper  if it should be accepted  i conceive the weight and value of
the pieces  charge of coinage deducted  should be such that they may
be aliquot parts of a spanish dollar  by the copy enclosed  of an old
letter of mine to mr bridgen  you will see the ideas i had of the
additional utility such a coinage might be of  in communicating
instruction  10 

_december 25th_  enclosed is a copy of a letter just received from the
count de vergennes  upon the present state of negotiation with
england  11

  sir 

i was honored with your letters by the danae  i congratulate you upon
the promising state of our negotiations  since peace begins to be no
less desirable here than elsewhere 

but i will not enter into that subject at present  as i mean to write
very fully both to mr jay and you by mr jefferson  who will sail in
company with this frigate in the romulus  a ship of fortyfour guns 
lest  however  any accident should happen to prevent his arriving so
soon as the emerald  i enclose a resolution of congress  which was
suggested by the proposition you mention to have been made to mr
oswald  on the subject of commerce  for my own part  i presume that it
is already included in your propositions  but as we have yet been
favored only with that short note of them  which has been transmitted
by you  we can form no accurate judgment on the subject  you can
hardly conceive the embarrassments that the want of more minute
details subjects us to 

you will learn from the count de rochambeau  that the french army
sailed the 24th ult  perhaps it were to be wished that they had
remained here  at least till new york and charleston were evacuated 
or rather till the peace  congress have  however  given them a good
word at parting  as you will see by the enclosed resolves  not being
consulted  they could interpose no objections to their departure 
though they were not without many reasons for wishing to detain them 

our finances are still in great distress  if the war continues  a
foreign loan in addition to those already received will be essential 
a plan for ascertaining what shall be called contingent expenses  is
under the consideration of congress  as well as the objections you
have stated with respect to the mode of paying your salaries  which
will  i believe  be altered  the allowance to mr franklin has been
confirmed  and your moderation and his upon this point have done you
both honor in the opinion of congress 

  i have the honor to be  sir   c

                                      philadelphia  january 6th  1783 

  sir 

i have before me your letters of the 25th and 29th of june  12th of
august  3d and 26th of september  and 14th of october last  several
matters contained in them have already been answered  and some others
i am unable to reply to  till congress have decided on such
propositions as i have submitted to their consideration 

the convention relative to consuls has been objected to by mr barclay 
on account of its prohibiting the consuls from trading  as the funds
of congress leave them no means of affording an adequate support to
persons who are qualified  they fear  that the only inducement to
accept the appointment will be taken away by this prohibition  mr
barclay s letter on that subject is under consideration 

i see the force of your objections to soliciting the additional twelve
millions  and i feel very sensibly the weight of our obligations to
france  but every sentiment of this kind must give way to our
necessities  it is not for the interest of our allies to lose the
benefit of all they have done  by refusing to make a small addition to
it  or at least to see the return that our commerce will make them
suspended by new convulsions in this country  the army have chosen
committees  a very respectable one is now with congress  they demand
with importunity their arrears of pay  the treasury is empty  and no
adequate means of filling it presents itself  the people pant for
peace  should contributions be exacted  as they have heretofore been 
at the point of the sword  the consequences may be more dreadful than
is at present apprehended  i do not pretend to justify the negligence
of the states in not providing greater supplies  some of them might do
more than they have done  none of them all that is required  it is my
duty to confide to you  that if the war is continued in this country 
it must be in a great measure at the expense of france  if peace is
made  a loan will be absolutely necessary to enable us to discharge
the army  that will not easily separate without pay  i am sorry that
neither mr jay nor you sent the propositions at large  as you have
made them  since we differ in opinion about the construction to be put
on your commercial article  as you will find by a resolution enclosed
in my letter 

i wish the concession made of our trade may be on conditions of
similar privileges on the part of great britain  you will see that
without this precaution  every ally that we have  that is to be
treated as the most favored nation  may be entitled to the same
privileges  even though they do not purchase them by a reciprocal
grant 

as to confiscated property  it is at present in such a state  that the
restoration of it is impossible  english debts have not  that i know
of  been forfeited  unless it be in one state  and i should be
extremely sorry to see so little integrity in my countrymen  as to
render the idea of withholding them a general one  however  it would
be well to say nothing about them  if it can conveniently be done 

i am more and more convinced  that every means in your power must be
used to secure the fisheries  they are essential to some states  and
we cannot but hate the nation  that keeps us from using this common
favor of providence  it was one of the direct objects for carrying on
the war  while i am upon this subject  i cannot but express my hope 
that every means will be used to guard against any mistrusts or
jealousies between you and france  the united states have shown their
confidence in her by their instructions  she has repeatedly promised
to procure for us _all we ask_  as far as it lies in her power  let
our conduct leave her without apology  if she acts otherwise  which i
am far from suspecting 

with respect to the seamen you mention  i wish if any further order is
necessary  than that which mr barclay already has  that you would give
it so far as to enable him to state their accounts  and transmit them
to mr morris  as the treaty with holland is concluded  i hope you have
made some progress in that with sweden  a plan of which has been
transmitted  another copy will go by mr jefferson 

i am glad to find you have some prospect of obtaining what is due on
the bon homme richard s prize money  that matter has been much spoken
of  and occasioned some reflection  as it is alleged that m  chaumont
was imposed on the officers as their agent by the court  and of course
that they should be answerable for his conduct  which certainly has
been very exceptionable 

congress have come to no determination  as to the size or expense of
the pillar they propose to erect at yorktown  what i wished of you was
to send me one or two plans  with estimates of the expense  in order
to take their sense thereon 

as to the designs of spain  they are pretty well known  and mr jay and
congress concur so exactly in sentiment with respect to them  that i
hope we have now nothing to fear from that quarter 

congress have it now under consideration to determine what should be
allowed as contingent expenses  i believe house rent will not be
allowed as such  i mentioned in my last what respected your grandson 
to which i have nothing to add  i agree with you in sentiment  that
your salaries should not depend on the fluctuations of the exchange 
and have submitted that part of your letter to congress  i believe
they will direct a stated sum to be paid  waiting for this
determination  i am prevented from drawing bills at this time  as to
the money received from me  you will be pleased to replace with it the
two quarters  salary you had drawn before it came to hand  you will
have bills for a third quarter  which have been sent on some time
since 

several important political events have taken place here lately  the
evacuation of charleston  the sailing of the french fleet and the
army  the decision of the great cause between connecticut and
pennsylvania  in favor of the latter  the state of the army   c   all
of which i should enlarge upon  if this was not to be delivered by mr
jefferson  who will be able to inform you fully on these points and
many others  that you will deem important to a right knowledge of the
present state of this country  12 

i enclose a state of the trade between these states and the west
indies  as brought in by a committee of congress  and referred to me 
it may possibly afford you some hints  and will serve to show how
earnestly we wish to have this market opened to us 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i am much obliged by your information of your intended trip to
england  i heartily wish you a good journey  and a speedy return  and
request your kind care of a packet for mr hodgson 

i enclose two papers  that were read at different times by me to the
commissioners  they may serve to show  if you should have occasion 
what was urged on the part of america on certain points  or may help
to refresh your memory  i send you also another paper  which i once
read to you separately  it contains a proposition for improving the
law of nations  by prohibiting the plundering of unarmed and usefully
employed people  i rather wish than expect  that it will be adopted 
but i think it may be offered with a better grace by a country  that
is likely to suffer least and gain most by continuing the ancient
practice  which is our case  as the american ships  laden only with
the gross productions of the earth  cannot be so valuable as yours 
filled with sugars or with manufactures  it has not yet been
considered by my colleagues  but if you should think or find that it
might be acceptable on your side  i would try to get it inserted in
the general treaty  i think it will do honor to the nations that
establish it 

with great and sincere esteem  i am  sir  your most obedient and most
humble servant

it is for the interest of humanity in general  that the occasions of
war  and the inducements to it should be diminished 

if rapine is abolished  one of the encouragements to war is taken
away  and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting 

the practice of robbing merchants on the high seas  a remnant of the
ancient piracy  though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular
persons  is far from being profitable to all engaged in it  or to the
nation that authorises it  in the beginning of a war  some rich ships 
not upon their guard  are surprised and taken  this encourages the
first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels  and many others to do
the same  but the enemy at the same time become more careful  arm
their merchant ships better  and render them not so easy to be taken 
they go also more under protection of convoys  thus while the
privateers to take them are multiplied  the vessels subject to be
taken  and the chances of profit  are diminished  so that many cruises
are made  wherein the expenses overgo the gains  and as is the case in
other lotteries  though particulars have got prizes  the mass of
adventurers are losers  the whole expense of fitting out all the
privateers  during a war  being much greater than the whole amount of
goods taken  then there is the national loss of all the labor of so
many men during the time they have been employed in robbing  who
besides spend what they get in riot  drunkenness  and debauchery  lose
their habits of industry  are rarely fit for any sober business after
a peace  and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and
housebreakers  even the undertakers  who have been fortunate  are by
sudden wealth led into expensive living  the habit of which continues
when the means of supporting it ceases  and finally ruins them  a just
punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many
honest innocent traders and their families  whose subsistence was
employed in serving the common interests of mankind 

should it be agreed and become a part of the law of nations  that the
cultivators of the earth are not to be molested or interrupted in
their peaceable and useful employment  the inhabitants of the sugar
islands would perhaps come under the protection of such a regulation 
which would be a great advantage to the nations who at present hold
those islands  since the cost of sugar to the consumer in those
nations  consists not merely in the price he pays for it by the pound 
but in the accumulated charge of all the taxes he pays in every war 
to fit out fleets and maintain troops for the defence of the islands
that raise the sugar  and the ships that bring it home  but the
expense of treasure is not all  a celebrated philosophical writer
remarks  that when he considered the wars made in africa  for
prisoners to raise sugars in america  the numbers slain in those wars 
the numbers that  being crowded in ships  perish in the
transportation  and the numbers that die under the severities of
slavery  he could scarce look on a morsel of sugar without conceiving
it spotted with human blood  if he had considered also the blood of
one another  which the white nations shed in fighting for those
islands  he would have imagined his sugar not as spotted only  but as
thoroughly dyed red  on these accounts i am persuaded  that the
subjects of the emperor of germany  and the empress of russia  who
have no sugar islands  consume sugar cheaper at vienna  and moscow 
with all the charge of transporting it after its arrival in europe 
than the citizens of london or of paris  and i sincerely believe  that
if france and england were to decide  by throwing dice  which should
have the whole of their sugar islands  the loser in the throw would be
the gainer  the future expense of defending them would be saved  the
sugars would be bought cheaper by all europe  if the inhabitants might
make it without interruption  and whoever imported the sugar  the same
revenue might be raised by duties at the custom houses of the nation
that consumed it  and  on the whole  i conceive it would be better for
the nations now possessing sugar colonies to give up their claim to
them  let them govern themselves  and put them under the protection of
all the powers of europe as neutral countries  open to the commerce of
all  the profits of the present monopolies being by no means
equivalent to the expense of maintaining them

  my dearest sir 

i cannot but in the most earnest manner  and from recent
circumstances  press your going early to versailles tomorrow  and i
have considerable reason to think  that your appearance there will not
displease the person whom you address  i am of opinion  that it is
very likely that you will have the glory of having concluded the peace
by this visit  at least i am sure  if the deliberations of tomorrow
evening end unfavorably  that there is the strongest appearance of
war  if they end favorably  perhaps little difficulty may attend the
rest 

after all  the peace will have as much that is conceded in it  as
england can in any shape be made just now to relish  owing to the
stubborn demands  principally of spain  who would not  i believe  upon
any motive recede from her conquests  what i wrote about gibraltar
arrived after the subject  as i understand  was canvassed  and when it
of course must have appeared impolitic eagerly and immediately to
revive it 

you reproved me  or rather reproved a political scheme yesterday  of
which i have heard more said favorably by your friends at paris  than
by any persons whatever in london  but do you  my dear sir  make this
peace  and trust our common sense respecting another war  england 
said a man of sense to me the other day  will come out of the war like
a convalescent out of disease  and must be re established by some
physic and much regimen  i cannot easily tell in what shape a
bankruptcy would come upon england  and still less easily in what mode
and degree it would affect us  but if your confederacy mean to
bankrupt us now  i am sure we shall lose the great fear that would
deter us from another war  your allies  therefore  for policy and for
humanity s sake  will  i hope  stop short of this extremity 
especially as we should do some mischief to others  as well as to
ourselves 

i am  my dearest sir  your devoted  ever affectionate  and ever
obliged

here  we may go together in my carriage  we should be on the road by

  sir 

i have just received your letters of november 9th and december 3d 
this is to inform you  and to request you to inform the congress  that
the preliminaries of peace between france  spain  and england  were
yesterday signed  and a cessation of arms agreed to by the ministers
of those powers  and by us in behalf of the united states  of which
act  so far as relates to us  i enclose a copy  i have not yet
obtained a copy of the preliminaries agreed to by the three crowns 
but hear  in general  that they are very advantageous to france and
spain  i shall be able  in a day or two  to write more fully and
perfectly  holland was not ready to sign preliminaries  but their
principal points are settled  mr laurens is absent at bath  and mr jay
in normandy  for their healths  but will both be here to assist in
forming the definitive treaty  i congratulate you and our country on
the happy prospects afforded us by the finishing so speedily this
glorious revolution  and am  with great esteem  sir   c

  sir 

it having been suspected  that i concurred in the appointment of your
grandson to the place of secretary to the american commission for
peace _at your instance_  i think it right  thus unsolicited  to put
it in your power to correct the mistake 

your general character  the opinion i had long entertained of your
services to our country  and the friendly attention and aid with which
you had constantly favored me after my arrival in spain  impressed me
with a desire of manifesting both my esteem and attachment by stronger
evidence than professions  that desire extended my regard for you to
your grandson  he was then indeed a stranger to me  but the terms in
which you expressed to congress your opinion of his being qualified
for another place of equal importance  were so full and satisfactory 
as to leave me no room to doubt of his being qualified for the one
above mentioned  i was  therefore  happy to assure you  in one of the
first letters i afterwards wrote you from spain  that in case a
secretary to our commission for peace should become necessary  and the
appointment be left to us  i should take that opportunity of evincing
my regard for you  by nominating him  or words to that effect  what i
then wrote  was the spontaneous suggestion of my own mind 
unsolicited  and i believe unexpected by you 

when i came here on the business of that commission  i brought with me
the same intentions  and should always have considered myself engaged
by honor  as well as inclination  to fulfil them  unless i had found
myself mistaken in the opinion i had imbibed of that young gentleman s
character and qualifications  but that not being the case  i found
myself at liberty to indulge my wishes  and be as good as my word  for
i expressly declare  that your grandson is  in my opinion  qualified
for the place in question  and that  if he had not been  no
consideration would have prevailed upon me to propose  or join in his
appointment 

this explicit and unreserved statement of facts is due to you  to him 
and to justice  and you have my consent to make any use of it that you
may think proper 

  i have the honor to be  sir  with great respect 
                                                             john jay

  sir 

as i know you are on the point of making a tour to france  i cannot
omit warmly recommending to you to endeavor  during your stay at
paris  to gain as much as possible  the confidence and esteem of mr
franklin 

you will recollect  sir  what i said to you in our conversations  of
the high respect which all the king s ministry have for that minister 
you have witnessed the satisfaction with which we have learned the
glorious issue of this war for the united states of america  and how
fully we are persuaded  that it will be for the general interest of
the two states to form  as soon as possible  reciprocal connexions of
friendship and commerce  nothing  certainly  would be more agreeable
to us  than to learn by your letters  that you find the same
dispositions in mr franklin  and in that case it seems to me the
shortest way of accelerating these new connexions would be to take the
treaty between the congress and the states general for the basis  and
that mr franklin should communicate to us his ideas on the changes or
additions which he might think reciprocally useful in the treaty of
commerce  which congress might conclude with us 

we should eagerly and frankly reply to such overtures  and  as soon as
the changes thus agreed on shall have met the approbation of congress 
one of the persons commissioned by that body  then in europe  might 
in order to gain time  come here with full powers to conclude  leaving
on both sides the most particular stipulations for the negotiations of
the ministers which those states shall  in the sequel  send to reside
with each other 

i shall finish  sir  with hoping that you may happily terminate the
visits you have proposed to make to the different parts of france  and
it is with sentiments of the most distinguished respect  that

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i but this moment hear of this opportunity  by which i can only send
you a line to acquaint you  that i have concluded the treaty with
sweden  which was signed on wednesday last  you will have a copy by
the first good opportunity  it differs very little from the plan sent
me  in nothing material  13  the english court is in confusion by
another change of ministry  lord shelburne and his friends having
resigned  but it is not yet certainly known who will succeed  though
lord north and mr fox are talked of as two  they being reconciled   i
cannot add  but that i am  with great esteem  sir   c

respecting our definitive treaty  which must conform to the
preliminaries  but we shall see

  my dear friend 

it is a long while since i have heard from you  or indeed since i
wrote to you  i heartily congratulate you on those pacific events 
which have already happened  and i wish to see all other final steps
of conciliation succeed speedily  i send you copies of two papers 
which i have already communicated to mr laurens  the one called
_conciliatory propositions  in march  1783_  the other _a sketch of a
provisional treaty of commerce for opening the ports between great
britain and the united states of america without delay_  to each of
which is prefixed a short state of the argument on each head 

as for the news of this country  you have doubtless heard  that lord
shelburne s administration has for some time been considered as at an
end  although no other has been as yet substituted in the place of it 
it was understood yesterday  and i believe with good foundation  that
what is now called the portland party have been applied to  and they
are now considered as the party most likely to succeed  as far as my
wishes go  such an event would be most satisfactory to me  i have
known the duke of portland for many years  and by experience i know
him to be a nobleman of the strictest honor  and of the soundest whig
principles  sincere and explicit in every thought and transaction 
manly in his judgment  and firm in his conduct  the kingdom of
ireland  of which he was lately lord lieutenant  bears unanimous
testimony to this character of him  the cavendish family   a good whig
name  mr fox  lord fitzwilliam   c   c  form the core of his system
and connexions  i most earnestly wish to see a firm administration
upon a whig foundation  which i should consider as a solid basis  on
the part of this country  for a perpetual correspondence of amity and
conciliation with america  i am very anxious to hear of your health 
god bless you 

  ever your most affectionate

               _conciliatory propositions  march  1783 _

terms of peace having been agreed upon between great britain and
france  on the 20th of january  1783  there need not be any further
delay in proceeding to conclude the proposed treaty between great
britain and the united states of america  upon the basis of the
provisional articles of the 30th of november  1782 

it is to be observed  that none of the articles of the provisional
treaty are to take effect  until the conclusion of the definitive
treaty with america  at which time likewise all places in the american
states  in possession of the british arms  are to be evacuated  and
the british army withdrawn from the united states  by article 7   if
therefore it should be wished on the part of great britain to bring
forward the fifth article respecting the loyalists  before the
conclusion of the definitive treaty with america  the bayonet should
be withdrawn from the american breast  by the voluntary removal of the
british troops with all convenient despatch  this condition of the
removal of the troops is likewise necessary  before any provisional
terms of commerce with america can take place 

by the 6th article of the provisional treaty  all future confiscations
in america are precluded  although the prosecutions at present
subsisting are not to be stopped before the definitive treaty  but if
the substantial pledge of returning amity on the part of great
britain  viz  the removal of the troops should be voluntarily
anticipated  it would be but reasonable that all prosecutions should
be immediately abated on the part of america  and to facilitate the
removal of the troops  the loyalists may be permitted to remain in
safety and unmolested   if they choose to remain  from the period of
removing the troops  until twelve months after the definitive treaty 

there is another article of the provisional treaty  the delay of which
is much to be lamented  viz  the mutual release of prisoners of war on
both sides  as this is an article of reciprocity  both sides from
principles of humanity are equally interested to bring it forward into
effect speedily  that those unhappy captives may not alone suffer the
miseries of war in the time of peace 

upon these considerations  the following supplemental terms of a
treaty between great britain and the united states are proposed 

1  that the british troops shall be withdrawn with all convenient
speed 

2  that the commissioners on both sides do proceed to the conclusion
of the definitive treaty 

3  that the commissioners do speedily negotiate a provisional
convention of commerce  hereunto annexed  to take place immediately 
the terms of this temporary convention  not to be pleaded on either
side in the negotiation of final and perpetual treaty of commerce 
between great britain and the united states 

4  that the commissioners do negotiate a perpetual treaty of commerce 

5  that all prosecutions of the loyalists in america be immediately
abated  and that they be permitted to remain until twelve months after
the definitive treaty  unmolested in their endeavors to obtain
restitution of their estates 

6  that all prisoners on both sides be immediately released 

7  that intercourse of amity and commerce do immediately take place
between great britain and the united states of america 

                                                   

            _sketch of a provisional treaty of commerce _

as soon as preliminaries of peace are signed with any independent
states  such as spain  france  and holland  the course of mutual
commerce emerges upon the same terms and conditions as were existing
antecedent to the war  the new duties imposed during the war excepted 
the case between great britain and america is different  because
america  from a dependent nation before the war  emerges an
independent nation after the war  the basis  therefore  of a
provisional treaty between great britain and the united states would
be simply to arrange such points as would emerge after the war 
impracticable and discordant to the newly established independence of
the american states  and to leave all others  as much as possible 
untouched  for instance  that all instrumental regulations  such as
papers  bonds  certificates  oaths  and all other documents should be 
between great britain and the united states  upon the same footing 
and no other than as between great britain and any other independent
nation  but that all duties  drawbacks  bounties  rights  privileges 
and all pecuniary considerations  should emerge into action and effect
as before  i say emerge as before  not stipulated for any fixed term 
because i am speaking of a provisional _treaty_  not of a provisional
_bill_ of commerce  for a specified period  by this means  all
difficulties  which otherwise would be accumulated  and obstruct a
temporary and provisional act are avoided _in limine_  the ports will
be immediately opened  upon specified and known conditions  if the
legislature of either country thinks proper to introduce on its own
part any new conditions or regulations  even previous to the intended
treaty of commerce  that will not shut the ports again generally but
only operate _pro tanto_ according to the case  on which side soever
any novel condition should arise  the other will likewise be at
liberty to make any corresponding regulations as between independent
nations  the great object is to open the ports between great britain
and the united states  immediately on the signature of preliminaries
of peace  as between france and great britain  by the proposition
above stated  great britain and france  and great britain and the
united states respectively  on the subject of intercourse of commerce 
would emerge again after the war into situations relatively similar to
their situation before the war 

the crown of great britain is enabled by the conciliatory act of 1782
to repeal  annul  make void  or suspend  for any time or times  the
operation and effect of any act of parliament  or any clause 
provision  matter  or thing therein contained  relating to the
colonies or plantations now become the united states of america  and 
therefore  the crown is not only competent to conclude  but likewise
to carry into effect any provisional treaty of commerce with america 
the first foundation must be laid in the total repeal of the
prohibitory act of december  1775  not only as prohibiting commerce
between great britain and the united states  but as the corner stone
of the war  by giving up universally all american property at sea to
military plunder  without any redress to be obtained by law in any
british court of admiralty  after this  all obstructions from the act
of navigation and other acts regulating the commerce of the states of
america  formerly dependent upon great britain   may be removed 
instructions may be sent to the commissioners of the customs to
dispense with bonds  certificates   c  which by the old laws are
required to be discharged or attested by supposed governors  naval or
customhouse officers in america  the questions of drawbacks  bounties 
 c  after opening the ports  may remain free points of discussion and
regulation  as between states having no commercial treaty subsisting
between them  as the crown is competent to open an intercourse of
commerce with america by treaty  this mode is preferable to any act of
parliament  which may be only a jealous and suspicious convention _ex
parte_  this mode by treaty avoids the accumulated difficulties  which
might otherwise obstruct the first opening of the ports by act of
parliament  and above all  it secures an alternate binding part of the
bargain  which no act of parliament can do 

breviate of the treaty  viz  provisional for intercourse and commerce
between great britain and the united states of america 

1  that all ports shall be mutually open for intercourse and commerce 

2  and therefore the king of great britain agrees to the repeal of the
prohibitory acts  viz  16 geo  3  chap  5   c  the king of great
britain likewise agrees by instructions  according to the laws of
great britain  to his commissioners of customs and other officers  to
remove all obstructions to american ships either entering inwards or
clearing outwards  which may arise from any acts of parliament
heretofore regulating the commerce of the american states  under the
description of british colonies or plantations  so as to accommodate
every circumstance to the reception of their ships  as the ships of
independent states 

3  all duties  drawbacks  bounties  rights  privileges  and all other
money considerations shall remain  respecting the united states of
america  upon the same footing as they now remain respecting the
province of nova scotia in america  or as if the aforesaid states had
remained dependent upon great britain  all this subject to regulations
or alterations by any future acts of the parliament of great britain 

4  on the part of the states of america  it is agreed that all laws
prohibiting the commerce of great britain shall be repealed 

5  agreed upon the same part  that all ships  and merchandise of the
british dominions shall be admitted upon the same terms as before the
war  except any imposts laid during the war  all this subject to
future regulations or alterations by the legislatures of the american
states respectively 

6  the principles and spirit of this treaty to be supported on either
side by any necessary supplemental arrangements  no tacit compliance
on the part of america in any subordinate points to be argued at any
time hereafter to the prejudice of their independence

  dear sir 

i received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me 
requesting a recommendation to america  of mr joshua grigby  i have
accordingly written one  and having an opportunity the other day  i
sent it under cover to mr benjamin vaughan  the general proclamations
you wished for suspending  or rather putting an end to hostilities 
are now published  so that your  heart is at rest   and mine with it 
you may depend on my joining my hearty endeavors with yours  in
 cultivating conciliatory principles between our two countries   and i
may venture to assure you  that if your bill for a provisional
establishment of the commerce had passed as at first proposed  a
stipulation on our part in the definitive treaty  to allow reciprocal
and equal advantages and privileges to your subjects  would have been
readily agreed to 

  with great and sincere esteem  i am ever   c

                                       philadelphia  march 26th  1783 

  sir 

i need hardly tell you  that the intelligence brought by the
washington diffused a general pleasure  we had long been in suspense
with respect to the negotiations  and had received no other lights on
that subject  than those the speech of his britannic majesty and mr
townshend s letters threw upon it  these were by no means sufficient
to dissipate all our apprehensions 

the terms you have obtained for us comprise most of the objects we
wish for  i am sorry  however  that you found it necessary to act with
reserve  and to conceal your measures from the court of france  i am
fearful that you will not be able to produce such facts  as will
justify this conduct to the world  or free us from the charge of
ingratitude to a friend  who has treated us not only justly but
generously 

but this is a disagreeable subject  and i refer you for my sentiments 
and those of congress  to my letter  in answer to the joint letter
from our ministers  i am sorry that the commercial article is stricken
out  it would have been very important to us to have got footing at
least in the british west indies  as a means of compelling france to
pursue her true interest and ours  by opening her ports also to us 

we have just learned by a vessel from cadiz  that the preliminary
articles for a general peace were signed the 20th  the abstract of the
treaty sent me by the marquis de lafayette  does the highest honor to
the moderation and wisdom of france  never has she terminated a war
with more glory  and in gaining nothing but that trophy of victory 
tobago  she has established a character  which confirms her friends 
disarms her enemies  and obtains a reputation that is of more value
than any territorial acquisitions she could make 

we have been in great distress with respect to our army  pains were
taken to inflame their minds  and make them uneasy at the idea of a
peace  which left them without support  inflammatory papers were
dispersed in camp  calling them together to determine upon some mad
action  the general interposed  postponed the meeting to a future day 
on which he met them  and made them an address  that will do him more
honor than his victories  after which they passed several resolves 
becoming a patriot army  congress are seriously engaged in endeavoring
to do them justice  i am in great hopes  that we shall shortly be
brought back to such a situation  as to be enabled to enjoy the
blessings you have laid the foundation of 

i received from mr franklin the papers relative to the portuguese
vessel  which i have caused to be laid before the court of appeals 
where the cause is now depending  the cargo having been condemned  and
the yacht acquitted at boston  i doubt not but full justice will be
done to the proprietors on the rehearing  you know so much of our
constitution as to see  that it is impossible to interfere further in
these matters  than by putting the evidence in a proper train to be
examined  i have had the proceedings in the case of the brig
providentia transmitted to me from boston  with a full state of the
evidence  which i have examined  the cargo is condemned and the vessel
acquitted  an allowance for freight having been made by the court  the
evidence does not admit a doubt of the justice of this decree  should
the court of denmark not be satisfied with this account  i will cause
a copy of the proceedings to be transmitted to you for their
satisfaction  i hope this mark of attention to them will induce them
to acknowledge the injustice they have done us  in the detention of
our prizes  this object should not be lost sight of 

i thank you for your present of m  d auberteuil s essay  and shall
dispose of the copies he has sent in the way you recommend  i could
hardly have believed it possible  that so many errors and falsehoods 
that would shock the strongest faith on this side of the water  could
be received as orthodox on the other 

i remit bills for the salaries of our ministers  it is impossible 
that i can adjust their accounts here  you must settle with them  and
they repay you out of the drafts i have made in their favor when they
have been overpaid  congress have  in pursuance of your sentiment  in
your letter of october  passed the enclosed resolution  14  so that
on the quarter s salary due in april  there will be a deduction of all
you gained by the course of exchange  and the payments will be reduced
to par  at which rate they will always be paid in future  this
deduction amounts on your salary to eight thousand three hundred and
thirtysix livres  as will appear from the account that will be stated
by mr morris  i shall pay your bills into the hands of mr robert
morris  whom you have constituted your agent  the bills for the other
gentlemen  who may not be with you  are committed to your care  as the
bills are drawn in their favor  they can only be paid on their
endorsement 

congress will  i believe  agree very reluctantly to let you quit their
service  the subject  together with mr adams s and mr laurens s
resignation  is under the consideration of a committee  if they report
before this vessel sails  you shall know their determination 

on the arrival of the triumph from cadiz  which brought orders for
recalling the cruisers of his britannic majesty  congress passed the
enclosed resolution  which i transmitted with the intelligence we had
received to carleton and digby  i sent my secretary with my letters 
and expect him back this evening  i am anxious to know how the first
messenger of peace has been received by them  as well as to discover
through him what steps they propose to take for the evacuation 

i ought to thank you for your journal before i conclude  the perusal
of it afforded me great pleasure  i must pray you to continue it  i
much wish to have every step  which led to so interesting an event as
the treaty  which established our independence  and though both mr jay
and mr adams are minute in their journals  for which i am much obliged
to them  yet new light may be thrown on the subject by you  who 
having been longer acquainted with the courts both of london and
versailles  have the means of more information relative to their
principles and measures 

  i have the honor to be  sir   c

  right noble  high  mighty  most honorable lords 

since  by the preliminary articles of peace  concluded lately between
the high belligerent powers  the illustrious united states of north
america have been acknowledged free  sovereign  and independent  and
now since european powers are courting in rivalry the friendship of
your high mightinesses 

we  impressed with the most lively sensations on the illustrious
event  the wonder of this  and the most remote future ages  and
desirous fully to testify the part which we take therein  do hereby
offer your high mightinesses our service and attachment to the cause 

and in the most sincere disposition of heart  we take the honor to
wish  so as from omnipotent providence we do pray  that the most
illustrious republic of the united states of america may  during the
remotest centuries  enjoy all imaginable advantages to be derived from
that sovereignty  which they gained by prudence and courage 

that  by the wisdom and active patriotism of your illustrious
congress  it may forever flourish and increase  and that the high and
mighty regents of those free united states may  with ease and in
abundance  enjoy all manner of temporal happiness  and at the same
time we most obsequiously recommend our city to a perpetual friendly
intelligence  and her trade and navigation in matters reciprocally
advantageous to your favor and countenance 

in order to show that such mutual commerce with the merchant houses of
this place may undoubtedly be of common benefit  your high
mightinesses will be pleased to give us leave to mark out some
advantages of this trading city 

here reigns a free unrestrained republican commerce  charged with but
few duties 

hamburg s situation upon the river elbe is  as if it were in the
centre of the baltic and the north sea  and as canals are cut from the
river through the city  goods may be brought in ships to the magazines
in town  and from thence again to all parts of the world 

hamburg carries on its trade with economy  it is the mart of goods of
all countries  where they can be purchased not only of good quality 
but sometimes cheaper than at first hand 

here linen  woollen goods  calicoes  glass  copper and all other
numerous produce of manufactured wares of the whole german empire  are
brought in by portuguese  spaniards  the english  dutch  french  and
other nations  and from hence further transported  in exchange
whereof  considerable quantities of north american goods  much wanted
in germany  may be taken 

m  penet  who in your country is honored with several offices  has
sojourned here for some time  and with all who had the honor of his
acquaintance  borne the character of an intelligent  skilful  and for
reciprocally advantageous commerce  a well disposed and zealous man 
will certainly have the complaisance to give your high mightinesses
further explanation of the advantages of this trading place  which we
have but briefly touched upon 

we now intercessionally and most obsequiously request your high
mightinesses to favor and countenance the trade of our merchants  and
to suffer them to enjoy all such rights and liberties as you allow to
merchants of nations in amity  which in gratitude and with zeal we
will in our place endeavor to retribute  not doubting that such mutual
intercourse may be effected  since a good beginning thereof is already
made on both sides  by the friendly reception of the vessels that have
arrived in either country 

in further testimony of our most attentive obsequiousness and sincere
attachment  we have deputed our citizen  john abraham de boor  who is
charged with the concerns of a considerable merchant house  which 
like several other merchant houses of good report and solidity in this
city  is desirous of entering with merchants of your country into
reciprocal commerce  he is to have the honor to present to your high
mightinesses this our most obsequious missive  wherefore we most
earnestly recommend him to your favorable reception  he has it from us
in express charge  most respectfully to give your high mightinesses 
if required  such upright and accurate accounts of our situation and
constitutions  as may be depended upon  and at the same time in person
to testify the assurance of the most perfect respect and attachment 
with which attentively we remain  right noble  high  mighty  and most
honorable lords  your most obsequious and devoted burgomaster and
senate of the imperial free city of hamburg 

given under our city seal  the 29th of march  1783

  my dear friend 

i send you a paper entitled _supplemental treaty_  the substance of
which i sent you some time ago  as i read it in part of a speech in
the house of commons  i have given a copy of it to mr l   as the
grounds upon which my friend  the duke of portland  would have wished
that any administration  in which he might have taken a part  should
have treated with the american ministers  all negotiations for the
formation of a ministry in concert with the duke of portland are at an
end 

the tenth article  which is supposed to be referred to the definitive
treaty  is a renewal of the same proposition  which i moved in
parliament some years ago  viz  on the 9th of april  1778  i see
nothing inconsistent with that proposition  either in the declaration
of independence or in the treaty with france  let it therefore
remain  and emerge after the war  as a point untouched by the war  i
assure you my consent should not be wanting to extend this principle
between all the nations upon earth  i know full well  that those
nations to which you and i are bound by birth and consanguinity  would
reap the earliest fruits from it  _owing no man hate  and envying no
man s happiness_  i should rejoice in the lot of my own country  and
on her part say to america  _nos duo turba sumus_  i send you 
likewise  enclosed with this  some sentiments respecting the
principles of some late negotiations  drawn up in the shape of
parliamentary motions by my brother  who joins with me in the
sincerest good wishes to you for health and happiness  and for the
peace of our respective countries  and of mankind 

  your ever affectionate

         _supplemental treaty between great britain and the
                    united states of north america _

1  that the british troops be withdrawn from the united states with
all convenient speed 

2  that all further prosecutions of loyalists in america be
immediately abated  and that they be permitted to remain until twelve
months after the definitive treaty with america in safety and
unmolested  in their endeavors to obtain restitution of their estates 

3  that all ports shall be mutually opened for intercourse and
commerce  between great britain and the united states 

4  agreed on the part of great britain  that all prohibitory acts
shall be repealed  and that all obstructions to american ships  either
entering inwards or clearing outwards  shall be removed  which may
arise from any acts of parliament  heretofore regulating the commerce
of the american states  under the description of british colonies and
plantations  so as to accommodate every circumstance to the reception
of their ships  as the ships of independent states 

5  agreed on the part of great britain  that all duties  rights 
privileges  and all pecuniary considerations shall remain  respecting
the united states of america  upon the same footing as they now remain
respecting the province of nova scotia  or as if the said states had
remained dependent upon great britain  all this subject to regulations
and alterations by any future acts of the parliament of great britain 

6  on the part of the american states it is agreed  that all laws
prohibiting commerce with great britain shall be repealed 

7  agreed on the part of the american states  that all ships and
merchandise of the british dominions shall be admitted upon the same
terms as before the war  all this subject to future regulations or
alterations by the legislatures of the american states respectively 

8  that all prisoners on both sides be immediately released 

9  the spirit and principles of this treaty to be supported on either
side by any necessary supplemental arrangements  no tacit compliance
on the part of the american states in any subordinate points to be
urged at any time hereafter in derogation of their independence 

                                                   

    _separate article to be referred to the definitive treaty _

10  neither shall the independence of the united states be construed
any further than as independence  absolute and unlimited in matters of
government  as well as commerce  not into alienation  and therefore
the subjects of his britannic majesty and the citizens of the united
states shall mutually be considered as natural born subjects  and
enjoy all rights and privileges as such in the respective dominions
and territories  in the manner heretofore accustomed 

                                                   

       _paper mentioned in the close of mr hartley s letter _

1  that it is the opinion of this house  that whenever great britain
thought proper to acknowledge the independence of america  the mode of
putting it into effect most honorably for this country  would have
been  to have made the declaration of independence previous to the
commencement of any treaty with any other power 

2  that a deviation from that line of conduct  has the effect of
appearing to grant the independence of america solely to the demands
of the house of bourbon  and not  as was the real state of the case 
from a change in the sentiments of this country  as to the object and
continuance of the american war 

3  that when this house  by its vote against the further prosecution
of offensive war in america  had given up the point of contest  and
adopted a conciliatory disposition  the pursuing those principles by
an immediate and liberal negotiation upon the basis of independence 
at the same time expressing a readiness to conclude a general peace
with the allies of america upon honorable terms  would have been the
most likely way to promote a mutual and beneficial intercourse between
the two countries  to establish peace upon a firm foundation  and
would have prevented the house of bourbon from having a right to claim
any further obligations from america  as the assertors of their
independence 

4  that the minister  who advised the late negotiations for peace  has
neglected to make use of those advantages  which the determination of
the house put him in possession of  that  by his delay in authorising
persons properly to negotiate with the american commissioners  he has
shown a reluctance to acting upon the liberal principles of granting
independence to america  as the determination of great britain upon
mature consideration of the question  and has by such methods given
advantage to the enemies of this country to promote and confirm that
commerce and connexion between the united states of america and
themselves  which during the contest have been turned from their
natural channel with this country  and which this peace so concluded
has not yet contributed to restore

  sir 

the imminent danger to which the vessels of your nation were exposed 
which sailed in march last from marseilles  and which owed their
safety to the god of the seas alone  emboldens me to call your
attention to this point 

some secret enemies   whom i know  having giving information to this
regency of their departure  nine armed ships immediately sailed to
wait for them at cape palos  it is to be presumed that the americans
had passed the straits 

algiers has many ships  and the politics of certain european powers do
not restrain them from paying tribute to enjoy peace  they make use of
these human harpies as a terror to the belligerent nations  whose
commerce they chain to the car of algerine piracy  we saw an example
of this  when his imperial majesty  to protect his flag  made use of
the firman of the sublime porte  it was attacked  and five prizes were
brought into this port in 1781  four of which with ballast were
restored in february  1782  at the claim of a capapigi bashaw of the
porte  and of m  timone  the imperial agent  who was expelled  and
whose correspondent i am  having been his secretary on this occasion 
and having revealed to his highness  prince kaunitz rietberg  minister
at the court of vienna  horrors and crimes which would have remained
unpunished but for my pen 

humanity alone  sir  has engaged me to give you this advice  i request
you will be pleased to keep it secret  your prudence will effect what
may be necessary on this occasion 

i have the honor to offer you every information respecting this port 
and flatter myself that i shall succeed therein  i think to depart
from this in may or june next for marseilles  and to leave these
barbarian pirates 

  i have the honor to be   c

monsieur de walterstorff has communicated to me a letter from your
excellency  which affords me great pleasure  as it expresses in clear
and strong terms the good disposition of your court 16  to form
connexions of friendship and commerce with the united states of
america  i am confident that the same good disposition will be found
in the congress  and having acquainted that respectable body with the
purport of your letter  i expect a commission will soon be sent 
appointing some person in europe to enter into a treaty with his
majesty the king of denmark for the purpose desired 

in the meantime  to prepare and forward the business as much as may
be  i send  for your excellency s consideration  such a sketch as you
mention  formed on the basis of our treaty with holland  on which i
shall be glad to receive your excellency s sentiments  and i hope
that this transaction when completed  may be the means of producing
and securing a long and happy friendship between our two nations 

to smooth the way for obtaining this desirable end  as well as to
comply with my duty  it becomes necessary for me on this occasion to
mention to your excellency the affair of our three prizes  which 
having during the war entered bergen as a neutral and friendly port 
where they might repair the damages they had suffered  and procure
provisions  were  by an order of your predecessor in the office you so
honorably fill  violently seized and delivered to our enemies  i am
inclined to think it was a hasty act  procured by the importunities
and misrepresentations of the british minister  and that your
government could not  on reflection  approve of it  but the injury was
done  and i flatter myself your excellency will think with me  that it
ought to be repaired  the means and manner i beg leave to recommend to
your consideration  and am  with great respect  sir   c

  sir 

you complain sometimes of not hearing from us  it is now near three
months since any of us have heard from america  i think our last
letters came with general de rochambeau  there is now a project under
consideration for establishing monthly packet boats between france and
new york  which i hope will be carried into execution  our
correspondence then may be more regular and frequent 

i send herewith another copy of the treaty concluded with sweden  i
hope  however  that you will have received the former  and that the
ratification is forwarded  the king  as the ambassador informs me  is
now employed in examining the duties payable in his ports  with a view
of lowering them in favor of america  and thereby encouraging and
facilitating our mutual commerce 

m  de walterstorff  chamberlain of the king of denmark  formerly chief
justice of the danish west india islands  was last year at paris 
where i had some acquaintance with him  and he is now returned hither 
the newspapers have mentioned him as intended to be sent minister from
his court to congress  but he tells me no such appointment has yet
been made  he assures me  however  that the king has a strong desire
to have a treaty of friendship and commerce with the united states 
and he has communicated to me a letter  which he received from m 
rosencrone  the minister for foreign affairs  expressing that
disposition  i enclose a copy of the letter  and if congress shall
approve of entering into such a treaty with the king of denmark  of
which i told m  de walterstorff i made no doubt  they will send to me 
or whom else they shall think proper  the necessary instructions and
powers for that purpose  in the meantime  to keep the business in
train  i have sent to that minister for his consideration  a
translation of the plan  _mutatis mutandis_  which i received from
congress for a treaty with sweden  accompanied by a letter  of which
likewise i enclose a copy  i think it would be well to make it one of
the instructions to whoever is commissioned for the treaty  that he
previously procure satisfaction for the prizes mentioned in my letter 

the definitive treaties have met with great delays  partly by the
tardiness of the dutch  but principally from the distractions in the
court of england  where for six or seven weeks there was properly no
ministry  nor any business effected  they have at last settled a
ministry  but of such a composition as does not promise to be lasting 
the papers will inform you who they are  it is now said  that mr
oswald  who signed the preliminaries  is not to return here  but that
mr david hartley comes in his stead to settle the definitive  a
congress is also talked of  and that some use is to be made therein of
the mediation formerly proposed of the imperial courts  mr hartley is
an old friend of mine  and a strong lover of peace  so that i hope we
shall not have much difficult discussion with him  but i could have
been content to have finished with mr oswald  whom we always found
very reasonable 

mr laurens  having left bath  mended in his health  is daily expected
at paris  where messieurs jay and adams still continue  mr jefferson
has not yet arrived  nor the romulus  in which ship i am told he was
to have taken his passage  i have been the more impatient of this
delay  from the expectation given me of full letters by him  it is
extraordinary  that we should be so long without any arrivals from
america in any part of europe  we have as yet heard nothing of the
reception of the preliminary articles in america  though it is now
nearly five months since they were signed  barney  indeed  did not get
away from hence before the middle of january  but copies went by other
ships long before him  he waited some time for the money he carried 
and afterwards was detained by violent contrary winds  he had a
passport from england  and i hope arrived safe  though we have been in
some pain for him  on account of a storm soon after he sailed 

the english merchants have shown great eagerness to reassume their
commerce with america  but apprehending that our laws prohibiting that
commerce  would not be repealed till england had set the example by
repealing theirs  a number of vessels they had loaded with goods  have
been detained in port  while the parliament have been debating on the
repealing bill  which has been altered two or three times  and is not
agreed upon yet  it was at first proposed to give us equal privileges
in trade with their own subjects  repealing thereby with respect to
us  so much of their navigation act  as regards foreign nations  but
that plan seems to be laid aside  and what will finally be done in the
affair is uncertain  there is not a port in france  and few in europe 
from which i have not received several applications of persons
desiring to be appointed consuls for america  they generally offer to
execute the office for the honor of it  without salary  i suppose the
congress will wait to see what course commerce will take  and in what
places it will fix itself  in order to find where consuls will be
necessary  before any appointments are made  and perhaps it will then
be thought best to send some of our own people  if they are not
allowed to trade  there must be a great expense for salaries  if they
may trade  and are americans  the fortunes they make will mostly
settle in our own country at last  the agreement i was to make here
respecting consuls  has not yet been concluded  the article of trading
is important  i think it would be well to reconsider it 

i have caused to be struck here the medal  which i formerly mentioned
to you  the design of which you seemed to approve  i enclose one of
them in silver  for the president of congress  and one in copper for
yourself  the impression on copper is thought to appear best  and you
will soon receive a number for the members  i have presented one to
the king  and another to the queen  both in gold  and one in silver to
each of the ministers  as a monumental acknowledgment  which may go
down to future ages  of the obligations we are under to this nation 
it is mighty well received  and gives general pleasure  if the
congress approve of it  as i hope they will  i may add something on
the die  for those to be struck hereafter  to show that it was done by
their order  which i could not venture to do till i had authority for
it 

a multitude of people are continually applying to me personally  and
by letters  for information respecting the means of transporting
themselves  families  and fortunes to america  i give no encouragement
to any of the king s subjects  as i think it would not be right in me
to do it  without their sovereign s approbation  and  indeed  few
offer from france but persons of irregular conduct and desperate
circumstances  whom we had better be without  but i think there will
be great emigrations from england  ireland  and germany  there is a
great contest among the ports  which of them shall be of those to be
declared _free_ for the _american trade_  many applications are made
to me to interest myself in the behalf of all of them  but having no
instructions on that head  and thinking it a matter more properly
belonging to the consul  i have done nothing in it 

i have continued to send you the english papers  you will often see
falsehoods in them respecting what i say and do   c  you know those
papers too well to make any contradiction of such stuff necessary from
me 

mr barclay is often ill  and i am afraid the settlement of our
accounts will be  in his hands  a long operation  i shall be impatient
at being detained here on that score  after the arrival of my
successor  would it not be well to join mr ridley with mr barclay for
that service  he resides in paris  and seems active in business  i
know not indeed whether he would undertake it  but wish he may 

the finances here are embarrassed  and a new loan is proposed by way
of lottery  in which it is said by some calculators  the king will pay
at the rate of seven per cent  i mention this to furnish you with a
fresh convincing proof against cavillers of the king s generosity
towards us  in lending us six millions this year at five per cent  and
of his concern for our credit  in saving by that sum the honor of mr
morris s bills  while those drawn by his own officers abroad have
their payment suspended for a year after they become due  you have
been told that france might help us more liberally if she would  this
last transaction is a demonstration of the contrary 

please to show these last paragraphs to mr morris  to whom i cannot
now write  the notice of this ship being short  but it is less
necessary  as mr grand writes him fully 

  with great esteem   c

although it is unnecessary for me to introduce to your acquaintance a
gentlemen so well known to you as mr hartley  who will have the honor
of delivering to you this letter  yet it may be proper for me to
inform you  that he has the full and entire confidence of his
majesty s ministers upon the subject of his mission 

permit me  sir  to take this opportunity of assuring you how happy i
should esteem myself  if it were to prove my lot to be the instrument
of completing a real and substantial reconciliation between two
countries  formed by nature to be in a state of friendship one with
the other  and thereby to put the finishing hand to a building  in
laying the first stone of which i may fairly boast that i had some
share 

i have the honor to be  with every sentiment of regard and esteem 
sir  your most obedient humble servant

the count del veome  an italian nobleman of great distinction  does me
the honor to be the bearer of this  i have not the satisfaction to be
personally acquainted with this gentleman  but am much solicited by
some of my particular friends  to whom his merits and character are
known  to afford him this introduction to you  he is  i understand  a
great traveller  and his view in going to america is merely to see the
country and its great men  i pray you will show him every civility 
and afford him that counsel  which as a stranger he may stand in need
of

  sir 

i have received the two letters of yesterday and today  which you have
done me the honor to write to me  and a copy of the three articles
discussed between the commissioners of the united states and mr
hartley  you are aware that i shall want a sufficient time to examine
them  before submitting to you the observations  which may relate to
our reciprocal interests  receive  in the meantime  my sincere thanks
for this communication 

i hope to have the honor of seeing you tomorrow at versailles  i trust
you will be able to be present with the foreign ministers  it is
observed  that the commissioners from the united states rarely show
themselves here  and inferences are drawn from it  which i am sure
their constituents would disavow  if they had a knowledge of them

  sir 

it was my intention to pay my devoirs at versailles tomorrow  i thank
your excellency  nevertheless  for your kind admonition  i omitted
two of the last three days from a mistaken apprehension  that being
holidays there would be no court  mr laurens and mr jay are both
invalids  and since my last severe fit of the gout  my legs have
continued so weak  that i am hardly able to keep pace with the
ministers who walk fast  especially in going up and down stairs 

i beg you to be assured  that whatever deficiency there may be of
strength  there is none of respect in  sir  your excellency s most
obedient and most humble servant

  dear friend 

i send you enclosed the copies you desired of the papers i read to you
yesterday  17  i should be happy if i could see  before i die  the
proposed improvement of the law of nations established  the miseries
of mankind would be diminished by it  and the happiness of millions
secured and promoted  if the practice of privateering could be
profitable to any civilized nation  it might be so to us americans 
since we are so situated on the globe  as that the rich commerce of
europe with the west indies  consisting of manufactures  sugars   c 
is obliged to pass before our doors  which enables us to make short
and cheap cruises  while our own commerce is in such bulky  low priced
articles as that ten of our ships taken by you are not equal in value
to one of yours  and you must come far from home at a great expense to
look for them  i hope therefore that this proposition  if made by us 
will appear in its true light  as having humanity only for its motive 
i do not wish to see a new barbary rising in america  and our long
extended coast occupied by piratical states  i fear lest our
privateering success in the two last wars  should already have given
our people too strong a relish for that most mischievous kind of
gaming  mixed blood  and if a stop is not now put to the practice 
mankind may hereafter be more plagued with american corsairs  than
they have been and are with the turkish  try  my friend  what you can
do  in procuring for your nation the glory of being  though the
greatest naval power  the first who voluntarily relinquished the
advantage that power seems to give them  of plundering others  and
thereby impeding the mutual communications among men of the gifts of
god  and rendering miserable multitudes of merchants and their
families  artizans  and cultivators of the earth  the most peaceable
and innocent part of the human species 

with great esteem and affection  i am ever  my dear friend  yours most
sincerely

  dear sir 

we have yet had no information from you subsequent to the signature of
preliminary articles by france  spain  and great britain  though we
have seen a declaration for the cessation of hostilities signed by
you  mr adams  and mr jay 

we grow every day more anxious for the definitive treaty  since we
have as yet discovered no inclination in the enemy to evacuate their
ports  and in sending off the slaves  they have directly infringed the
provisional treaty  though we on our part have paid the strictest
regard to it  this will be more fully explained by the enclosed copy
of a letter from general washington  containing a relation of what
passed between him and general carleton at a late interview  let me
again entreat  that no doubt may be left in the treaty relative to the
time and manner of evacuating their ports here  without more precision
and accuracy in this than we find in the provisional articles  we
shall soon be involved in new disputes with great britain 

our finances are still greatly embarrassed  you may in part see our
distress  and the means congress are using to relieve themselves  by
the enclosed pamphlet  which i wish you and your colleagues to read 
but not to publish 

the enclosed resolution imposes a new task upon you  i hope you will
find no great difficulty in procuring the small augmentation to the
loan which it requires  be assured that it is extremely necessary to
set us down in peace 

none of the states  though frequently called upon  have sent me the
estimates of their losses by the ravages of the british  except
connecticut and rhode island  and their accounts are extremely
imperfect  such as they are i enclose them  for my own part  i have no
great expectation that any compensation for these losses will be
procured  however  if possible it should be attempted  commissioners
might be appointed to ascertain them here 

great part of the prisoners are on their way to new york  and the
whole will be sent in a few days  they will amount to about six
thousand men 

our ports begin to be crowded with vessels  there is reason to fear
that a superabundance of foreign articles will  in the end  produce as
much distress as the want of them has heretofore occasioned 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i informed you sometime since  that i had written to the court of
appeals on the subject of the nossa senhora da soledado san miguel e
almas  and laid before them the papers you sent me  the cause has
since been determined in such a way as will  i hope  be satisfactory
to her portuguese majesty  i enclose the copy of a letter from the
first judge of the court of appeals on that subject 

nothing has yet been done as to the acceptance of your resignation 
nor will  as i believe  anything be done very hastily  many think your
task will not be very burdensome now  and that you may enjoy in peace
the fruit of your past labors 

as this will probably be the last letter  which i shall have the
pleasure of writing to you in my public character  i beg leave to
remind you of the affairs of the alliance and the bon homme richard 
which are still unsettled  i must also pray you not to lose sight of
the vessels detained by his danish majesty  this will be a favorable
opportunity to press for their restitution  i do not see how they can
decently refuse to pay for them  great britain is bound in honor to
make them whole again 

preparations for the evacuation of new york still go on very slowly 
while the distress of our finances has compelled us to grant furloughs
to the greater part of our army 

if it were possible to procure any addition to the last six millions 
it would be extremely useful to us at present 

an entire new arrangement with respect to our foreign department is
under consideration  what its fate will be  i know not

  sir 

i wrote to you fully by a vessel from nantes  which i hope will reach
you before this  if not  this may inform you that the ratification of
the treaty with sweden is come  and ready to be exchanged when i shall
receive that from congress  that the treaty with denmark is going on 
and will probably  be ready before the commission for signing it
arrives from congress  it is on the plan of that proposed by congress
for sweden 

portugal has likewise proposed to treat with us  and the ambassador
has earnestly urged me to give him a plan for the consideration of his
court  which i have accordingly done  and he has forwarded it  the
congress will send commissions and instructions for concluding these
treaties to whom they may think proper  it is only upon the old
authority  given  by a resolution  to myself with messrs deane and
lee  to treat with any european powers  that i have ventured to begin
these treaties in consequence of overtures from those crowns 

the definitive treaty with england is not yet concluded  their
ministry being unsettled in their minds as to the terms of the
commercial part  nor is any other definitive treaty yet completed
here  nor even the preliminaries signed of one between england and
holland  it is now five months since we have had a line from you  the
last being dated the 13th of january  of course we know nothing of the
reception of the preliminary articles  or the opinion of congress
respecting them  we hoped to receive before this time such
instructions as might have been thought proper to be sent to us for
rendering more perfect the definitive treaty  we know nothing of what
has been approved or disapproved  we are totally in the dark  and
therefore  less pressing to conclude  being still  as we have long
been  in daily expectation of hearing from you  by chance only  we
learn that barney is arrived  by whom went the despatches of the
commissioners  and a considerable sum of money  no acknowledgment of
the receipt of that money is yet come to hand  either to me or m 
gerard  i make no doubt that both you and mr morris have written  and
cannot imagine what has become of your letters

i have just received his majesty s ratification of the treaty of

permit me  sir  on this occasion to repeat the request which the

the honor to tell you  that it would afford the king a pleasure to
have a person residing with him  in the capacity of the minister of
congress  who bears your name in conjunction with such estimable
qualifications as young mr franklin possesses  he charged me before he
departed  to repeat to you the same assurances  and you will allow me
to add  on my part  my best wishes for the success of this matter

  dear sir 

we have been honored with several of your letters  and we have talked
of writing to you  but it has been delayed  i will therefore write a
few lines in my private capacity 

our negotiations go on slowly  every proposition being sent to
england  and answers not returning very speedily 

captain barney arrived here last wednesday  and brought despatches for
us as late as the first of june  the preliminary articles are
ratified  but general carleton  in violation of those articles  has
sent away a great number of negroes  alleging  that freedom having
been promised them by a proclamation  the honor of the nation was
concerned   c  probably another reason may be  that if they had been
restored to their masters  britain could not have hoped anything from
such another proclamation hereafter 

mr hartley called yesterday to tell us  that he had received a letter
from mr fox  assuring him that our suspicions of affected delays or
change of system on their side were groundless  and that they were
sincerely desirous to finish as soon as possible  if this be so  and
your health will permit the journey  i could wish your return as soon
as possible  i want you here on many accounts  and should be glad of
your assistance in considering and answering our public letters  there
are matters in them of which i cannot conveniently give you an account
at present 

nothing could be more seasonable than success in the project you
proposed  but we have now very little expectation 

please to give my love to your valuable and amiable son and daughter 
and believe me  with sincere esteem   c 

                                                          b  franklin 

                                                   

     from m  rosencrone  minister of denmark  to b  franklin

  sir 

it was with the greatest alacrity  that i laid before his majesty the
letter you did me the honor to write to me  as also the project of a
treaty of amity and commerce that accompanied it  the king observed 
with the greatest satisfaction  the assurances contained in that
letter  of the good disposition of congress to form connexions of
amity and commerce with his kingdoms  such connexions being equally
conformable to the interests of the two states  and to his majesty s
sincere desire to cement  by every possible means  that harmony 
union  and confidence  which he wishes to establish forever between
his crown and the united states 

the enclosed _counter project_ differs in nothing essential from the
project sent by you  being drawn up entirely conformable to the same
principles  which you will be certainly convinced of  sir  by the note
explaining the reasons for adding some articles  and only giving a
different turn to others  so that i flatter myself  that i shall soon
hear that you are perfectly satisfied with them  having observed the
most perfect reciprocity carefully established throughout 

as to the object mentioned in the letter with which you have honored
me  you already know  sir  his majesty s generous intentions towards
the individuals in question  and his majesty is the more induced to
avail himself of the first opportunity to manifest these intentions 
as he thinks he may reasonably hope that congress will also consider
them as a distinguished proof of his friendship and esteem for that
respectable body 

there remains nothing further for me to add  but that the king will
adopt with great pleasure the most proper means to accelerate the
conclusion of the treaty  which we have begun  for myself  it will be
the most agreeable part of my office  sir  to assist in perfecting
such happy connexions with a minister of such universal reputation as
yourself  and it is with sentiments of the most distinguished regard 
that i have the honor to be  c

freely navigate from port to port  and on the coasts of the states at
enmity with the other party  and that the vessels and ships being

everything shall be judged free which shall be found on board of the
vessels belonging to the subjects of one of the contracting parties 
although the loading  or part of it  should belong to the enemies of
one of them  it being  nevertheless  well understood  that contraband
goods shall be always excepted  and it is also agreed  that this same
liberty shall extend to the persons of such as shall be found on board

shall be bound every time they shall be required  to exhibit  as well
on the high seas as in port  their passports  or sea letters  and
other public documents  which shall expressly prove that their loading
is not of that kind  which is prohibited as contraband  it being well
understood  nevertheless  that in all cases  where such merchant
vessels shall be escorted by one or more vessels of war  the simple
declaration of the officer commanding the convoy  that these vessels
do not carry any contraband goods  shall be considered as fully
sufficient  and they shall not require to examine the papers of the
escorted vessels 


                              article ix 

it shall no sooner be found by the sea letters  passports  or other

officer of the convoy  that the merchant vessels are not laden with
contraband goods  than they shall be at liberty to continue their
voyage without any hinderance  but if  on the contrary  the exhibition
of the said passports or other documents  in case the vessels are not

merchandise  which by virtue of the treaty shall be considered free

merchandises  and that the commander of the vessel consents to deliver
them up to the privateer  which shall have discovered them  then the
captain  who shall have made the prize  after having received the
merchandise  must immediately release the vessel  and shall not in any
wise prevent the continuation of his voyage  but in case the
contraband merchandise cannot all be taken on board the captor  then
the captain of the said vessel shall be at liberty  notwithstanding

shall have been laden on board of a vessel belonging to the enemy

manner by the subjects of the two contracting parties to places
belonging to the enemy  excepting  nevertheless  such as shall be
actually besieged  blocked up or invested  and such shall only be
considered so  where the vessels of the power that attacks shall be so

contraband effects on board of the vessels  and whether they are
destined to carry them to an enemy s country  or not  if the names of
the persons to whom the effects on board belong  are not expressed in
the said documents  this omission shall not  however  give cause for
confiscation  as the freedom of the vessel secures the freedom of the
effects

                    explanation of the counter project

       _of a treaty of amity and commerce received from denmark _

                              translation 

although the simple comparison of the enclosed counter project  with
the project proposed by mr franklin  evidently proves the attention
that has been shown on our part here to the negotiation set on foot 
and which  in the main  has been agreed upon as to the principles 
which have been adopted for the basis of a treaty  as well as the most
essential stipulations  we could not avoid  however  explaining more
distinctly certain points of the counter project  and the
eclaircissements that will be given of them will at the same time
prove the amicable intentions  with which it has been endeavored to
facilitate the consequences of an affair too important to the welfare
of the two nations  not to merit the attention and cares of the powers
which govern them 

the second and third articles will regulate the conduct of the
reciprocal subjects in the respective states  taking things as they
now are  it is easily perceived that the stipulations of the said
articles  although apparently reciprocal  give however superior
advantages to the united states  for  according to the system of
commerce  which subsists in denmark and norway  the most favored
nations pay there no greater imposts or other duties than the proper
subjects of the state  and the proper subjects of the state enjoy
considerable diminutions with respect to unprivileged nations  as well
for their vessels as their merchandise  it is evident  therefore  that
the subjects of the united states of america being received among the
most favored nations in denmark and norway  would not only gain by
that means a competition with the said most favored  but also a
preference over several other nations  even in the neighborhood of
denmark  with whom no treaties of commerce have been concluded  and
who  therefore  are still in the number of unprivileged  as to
navigation and commerce  in the states of his danish majesty 

on the other hand  if the advantages  which would result from these
articles  as to the commerce of the subjects of denmark in the
territories of the united states  are considered  the said advantages
would be confined to the simple competition with every other foreign
nation  but  as there is no nation that we know of  which actually
pays in the territories of the united states other or greater duties 
than what the privileged or most favored nations are bound to pay  the
danish subjects would not find in the territories of the united states
the same preference  which the subjects of the united states would
obtain in denmark and norway  the preceding considerations are not
advanced for the purpose of taking any advantage  but they are pointed
out only to show the impartiality and good will  with which we desire
to contribute to the mutual connexions of amity and commerce between
the two nations  who will  it is to be hoped  more and more unite  as
to the periods inserted in these articles  they do not essentially
change the stipulations projected by the minister of the united
states  they only add therein some proper determination to prevent
every misunderstanding on the subject of the reciprocal liberties and
privileges  and to guaranty some rights  which the subjects of his
danish majesty enjoy with respect to certain countries and colonies 
as iceland  greenland  finmarson  faro  the establishment of
tranquibar  and  in certain respects  the islands of st croix  st
thomas  and st john  and if  at any time  it should please the united
states to reserve for its own subjects similar rights  with respect to
certain places  or certain kinds of merchandise  and to exclude
therefrom every foreign nation  the same stipulations shall then suit
their intentions  in like manner the same mark of reciprocity has been
given to every change  excepting only the last clause of the third
article  which has not been susceptible of the same turn  considering
the local position of the united states  and which  undoubtedly for
the same reason  has been inserted in the treaty of the united states
with holland  in the same manner as it is here in the counter project 

after having pointed out the privileges  which the subjects of his
danish majesty enjoy in the islands of st croix  st thomas  and st
john  it will not be useless to observe  that it is only the commerce
and navigation between the said islands and europe  which denmark has
appropriated to itself in any manner  but the commerce  which is
conducted between those islands and north america  although always
subject to the same interior regulations on both sides  has been for a
long while authorised by his danish majesty s commercial laws  and his
said majesty has  moreover  granted to the islands of st thomas and st
john privileges  which will give the commerce of these islands  with
america in particular  a freer course  and very different from that of
the commerce of the colony  the advantages  which the united states
may derive from a more close commercial connexion with the said
privileged islands  and whose ports  distinguished by the security
they insure to vessels  appear to invite the commercial subjects of
america  are too evident to need any circumstantial detail  there
shall only be added  therefore  to what has been said  this single
observation  that his danish majesty  having it very much at heart to
open every possible road to industry and commerce  finds himself much
disposed to favor the connexion in question  and that  if for this
purpose the united states  after the conclusion of the present treaty 
which shall fix the general commercial points between the contracting
parties  should desire a particular convention to agree upon the
reciprocal and local advantages proper to accomplish this object  his
said majesty would willingly come into it  provided that the united
states were equally disposed on their part to facilitate the affair 

the fourth and fifth articles have only been modified in order to
remove the doubts  which might arise with respect to the defence and
protection due to the vessels belonging to the respective subjects  it
is only in cases of attack from the common enemy  against whom it was
conceived possible to confine each other by these articles  for in
case that one of the parties was at war and the other at peace  the
vessels belonging to the neutral party could not protect the vessels
belonging to the belligerent party  without taking a part and quitting
its neutrality 

the privileges of the most favored nations undoubtedly guaranty to the
respective subjects the favors mentioned in the sixth  eleventh 
fourteenth  and seventeenth articles of the project  for this reason
it has appeared  that it would be better to reduce the points detailed
in these articles to the number of general liberties of the most
favored nations  and this is what has been done in the sixth 
thirteenth  sixteenth  and twentyfirst articles of the counter
project  contenting ourselves here with the assurance  that the
subjects of his danish majesty in the cases mentioned here  as well as
in any other  shall be regarded and treated in the territories within
the dominions of the united states as the most favored nations  and in
expectation that the united states will not demand anything more in
these respects 

the seventh  eighth  and ninth articles of the counter project only
contain the spirit and ideas of the fifteenth  seventh  and eighth
articles of the project  to which has been added some further
stipulations  conformable to the principles  which have been
established and acknowledged with respect to the commerce of neutral
nations in time of war 

the term of two months  which has been proposed in the ninth article 
and that of six months named in the twelfth article of the project 
did not appear to correspond with the extent of commerce  which is
carried on  particularly with the east indies  nor with difficulties 
which the merchants or inhabitants sometimes find in arranging their
affairs to change their abode  it is for this reason  that instead of
two and six months  the terms six and nine months have been
substituted  it being nevertheless well understood  that from the
friendship and good understanding  which is about being strengthened
between the two nations  the subjects of neither party will ever have
cause to take refuge on account of a rupture 

although no fault has been found as to the merchandise  which the
project has called contraband  or not contraband in time of war  there
is however reason to think  that it would still be better for the
conveniency of the contracting parties  only to name in express terms
the contraband  without detailing the free merchandise  with respect
to which no better explanation could be given  as it appears  than by
agreeing that everything that is not called contraband shall be
comprehended in the number of free merchandise  consequently  on this
principle  the seventeenth article of the counter project has been
arranged  and at the end of the article has been added the definition
of a port that is blocked up 

the new articles that have been proposed on this side principally turn
on reciprocal points and favors  which justice and equity demand  and
which humanity and the rights of nations ordinarily grant  even
without stipulation by express conventions  but it is usage that has
introduced them into treaties  and it is conceived that it is no less
necessary to conform thereto 

as to the passports mentioned in the eighteenth article of the counter
project  there is nothing easier than to agree about them after the
conclusion of the treaty  or at the time when it is concluded  and the
models that shall be agreed on can then be officially exchanged and
published in case of necessity

  sir 

his imperial majesty  the emperor of morocco  did me the honor to
appoint me to be the bearer of his answer to the united provinces of
north america  with which he is willing to sign a treaty of peace and
commerce  and in consequence has already given orders to his captains
of men of war not to molest on the open seas the american vessels 
which agreeable news i have already given to mr richard harrison 
according to my instructions  i am to accompany to the court of
morocco the ambassador  that will be appointed to conclude the treaty
of peace  i presume  that your excellency is already acquainted  that
the travelling expenses and other charges of ambassadors  or envoys 
sent to europe by the emperor of morocco  are to be paid by the court 
or republic  that demands his friendship  in a few days i intend to
set out for madrid  where i will remain till i receive your
excellency s answer to this letter  directed to william carmichael 
the united states chargé d affaires at the court of spain  who  i make
no doubt  will receive orders to supply me with the money i may want
on the occasion 

as soon as i arrive at paris i shall have the satisfaction to
entertain at large your excellency on the present negotiation  not
doubting it will soon be concluded to the advantage of both courts 

  in the meantime i remain  most truly  sir   c

english  otherwise i could only do it in the italian language

                        passy  july 22d  1783 

  sir 

you have complained  sometimes with reason  of not hearing from your
foreign ministers  we have had cause to make the same complaint  six
full months having intervened between the latest date of your
preceding letters and the receipt of those by captain barney  during
all this time we were ignorant of the reception of the provisional
treaty  and the sentiments of congress upon it  which  if we had
received sooner  might have forwarded the proceedings on the
definitive treaty  and  perhaps  brought them to a conclusion  at a
time more favorable than the present  but these occasional
interruptions of correspondence are the inevitable consequences of a
state of war  and of such remote situations  barney had a short
passage  and arrived some days before colonel ogden  who also brought
despatches from you  all of which are come safe to hand  we  the
commissioners  have in our joint capacity written a letter to you 
which you will receive with this 

i shall now answer yours of march the 26th  may the 9th  and may the
31st 

it gave me great pleasure to learn by the first  that the news of
peace diffused general satisfaction  i will not now take it upon me to
justify the apparent reserve  respecting this court  at the signature 
which you disapprove  we have touched upon it in our general letter  i
do not see  however  that they have much reason to complain of that
transaction  nothing was stipulated to their prejudice  and none of
the stipulations were to have force  but by a subsequent act of their
own  i suppose  indeed  that they have not complained of it  or you
would have sent us a copy of the complaint  that we might have
answered it  i long since satisfied count de vergennes about it here 
we did what appeared to all of us best at the time  and if we have
done wrong  the congress will do right  after hearing us  to censure
us  their nomination of five persons to the service seems to mark 
that they had some dependence on our joint judgment  since one alone
could have made a treaty by direction of the french ministry as well
as twenty 

i will only add  that with respect to myself  neither the letter from
m  marbois  handed us through the british negotiators   a suspicious
channel  nor the conversations respecting the fishery  the boundaries 
the royalists   c  recommending moderation in our demands  are of
weight sufficient in my mind to fix an opinion  that this court wished
to restrain us  in obtaining any degree of advantage we could prevail
on our enemies to accord  since those discourses are fairly
resolvable  by supposing a very natural apprehension  that we  relying
too much on the ability of france to continue the war in our favor 
and supply us constantly with money  might insist on more advantages
than the english would be willing to grant  and thereby lose the
opportunity of making peace  so necessary to all our friends 

i ought not  however  to conceal from you  that one of my colleagues
is of a very different opinion from me in these matters  he thinks the
french minister one of the greatest enemies of our country  that he
would have straitened our boundaries  to prevent the growth of our
people  contracted our fishery  to obstruct the increase of our
seamen  and retained the royalists among us  to keep us divided  that
he privately opposes all our negotiations with foreign courts  and
afforded us  during the war  the assistance we received only to keep
it alive  that we might be so much the more weakened by it  that to
think of gratitude to france is the greatest of follies  and that to
be influenced by it would ruin us  he makes no secret of his having
these opinions  expresses them publicly  sometimes in presence of the
english ministers  and speaks of hundreds of instances which he could
produce in proof of them  none  however  have yet appeared to me 
unless the conversations and letter abovementioned are reckoned such 

if i were not convinced of the real inability of this court to furnish
the further supplies we asked  i should suspect these discourses of a
person in his station might have influenced the refusal  but i think
they have gone no further than to occasion a suspicion  that we have a
considerable party of antigallicans in america  who are not tories 
and consequently  to produce some doubts of the continuance of our
friendship  as such doubts may hereafter have a bad effect  i think we
cannot take too much care to remove them  and it is  therefore  i
write this to put you on your guard   believing it my duty  though i
know that i hazard by it a mortal enmity  and to caution you
respecting the insinuations of this gentleman against this court  and
the instances he supposes of their ill will to us  which i take to be
as imaginary as i know his fancies to be  that count de vergennes and
myself are continually plotting against him  and employing the
newswriters of europe to depreciate his character   c  but as
shakspeare says   trifles light as air    c  i am persuaded  however 
that he means well for his country  is always an honest man  often a
wise one  but sometimes  and in some things  absolutely out of his
senses 

when the commercial article  mentioned in yours of the 26th  was
struck out of our proposed preliminaries by the british ministry  the
reason given was  that sundry acts of parliament still in force were
against it  and must be first repealed  which i believe was really
their intention  and sundry bills were accordingly brought in for
that purpose  but new ministers with different principles succeeding 
a commercial proclamation totally different from those bills has
lately appeared  i send enclosed a copy of it  we shall try what can
be done in the definitive treaty towards setting aside that
proclamation  but if it should be persisted in  it will then be a
matter worthy the attentive discussion of congress  whether it will be
most prudent to retort with a similar regulation in order to force its
repeal   which may possibly tend to bring on another quarrel  or to
let it pass without notice  and leave it to its own inconvenience  or
rather impracticability in the execution  and to the complaints of the
west india planters  who must all pay much dearer for our produce
under those restrictions 

i am not enough master of the course of our commerce to give an
opinion on this particular question  and it does not behove me to do
it  yet i have seen so much embarrassment and so little advantage in
all the restraining and compulsive systems  that i feel myself
strongly inclined to believe  that a state  which leaves all her ports
open to all the world upon equal terms  will  by that means  have
foreign commodities cheaper  sell its own productions dearer  and be
on the whole the most prosperous  i have heard some merchants say 
that there is ten per cent difference between _will you buy _ and
_will you sell _ when foreigners bring us their goods  they want to
part with them speedily  that they may purchase their cargoes and
despatch their ships  which are at constant charges in our ports  we
have then the advantage of their _will you buy _ and when they demand
our produce  we have the advantage of their _will you sell _ and the
concurring demands of a number also contribute to raise our prices 
thus both those questions are in our favor at home  against us
abroad 

the employing  however  of our own ships and raising a breed of seamen
among us  though it should not be a matter of so much private profit
as some imagine  is nevertheless of political importance  and must
have weight in considering this subject 

the judgment you make of the conduct of france in the peace  and the
greater glory acquired by her moderation than even by her arms 
appears to me perfectly just  the character of this court and nation
seems  of late years  to be considerably changed  the ideas of
aggrandisement by conquest are out of fashion  and those of commerce
are more enlightened and more generous than heretofore  we shall soon 
i believe  feel something of this in our being admitted to a greater
freedom of trade with their islands  the wise here think france great
enough  and its ambition at present seems to be only that of justice
and magnanimity towards other nations  fidelity and utility to its
allies 

the ambassador of portugal was much pleased with the proceedings
relating to their vessel  which you sent me  and assures me they will
have a good effect at his court  he appears extremely desirous of a
treaty with our states  i have accordingly proposed to him the plan of
one  nearly the same with that sent me for sweden  and after my
agreeing to some alterations  he has sent it to his court for
approbation  he told me at versailles  last tuesday  that he expected
its return to him on saturday next  and anxiously desired that i would
not despatch our packet without it  that congress might consider it 
and  if approved  send a commission to me or some other minister to
sign it 

i venture to go thus far in treating  on the authority only of a kind
of general power  given formerly by a resolution of congress to messrs
franklin  deane  and lee  but a special commission seems more proper
to complete a treaty  and more agreeable to the usual forms of such
business 

i am in just the same situation with denmark  that court by its
minister here has desired a treaty with us  i have proposed a plan
formed on that sent me for sweden  it has been under consideration
some time at copenhagen  and is expected here this week  so that i may
possibly send that also by this conveyance  you will have seen by my
letter to the danish prime minister  that i did not forget the affair
of the prizes  what i then wrote  produced a verbal offer made me
here  of £10 000 sterling  proposed to be given by his majesty to the
captors  if i would accept it as a full discharge of our demand  i
could not do this  i said  because it was not more than a fifth part
of the estimated value  in answer  i was told that the estimation was
probably extravagant  that it would be difficult to come at the
knowledge of their true value  and that whatever they might be worth
in themselves  they should not be estimated as of such value to us
when at bergen  since the english probably watched them  and might
have retaken them in their way to america  at least  they were at the
common risk of the seas and enemies  and the insurance was a
considerable drawback  that this sum might be considered as so much
saved for us by the king s interference  for that if the english
claimants had been suffered to carry the cause into the common courts 
they must have recovered the prizes by the laws of denmark  it was
added  that the king s honor was concerned  that he sincerely desired
our friendship  but he would avoid  by giving this sum in the form of
a present to the captors  the appearance of its being exacted from him
as the reparation of an injury  when it was really intended rather as
a proof of his strong disposition to cultivate a good understanding
with us 

i replied  that the value might possibly be exaggerated  but that we
did not desire more than should be found just on inquiry  and that it
was not difficult to learn from london what sums were insured upon the
ships and cargoes  which would be some guide  and that a reasonable
abatement might be made for the risk  but that the congress could not 
in justice to their mariners  deprive them of any part that was truly
due to those brave men  whatever abatement they might think fit to
make  as a mark of their regard for the king s friendship  of the part
belonging to the public  that i had  however  no instructions or
authority to make any abatement of any kind  and could  therefore 
only acquaint congress with the offer  and the reasons that
accompanied it  which i promised to state fully and candidly  as i
have now done  and attend their orders  desiring only that it might be
observed  we had presented our complaint with decency  that we had
charged no fault on the danish government  but what might arise from
inattention or precipitancy  and that we had intimated no resentment 
but had waited with patience and respect the king s determination 
confiding  that he would follow the equitable disposition of his own
breast  by doing us justice as soon as he could do it with
conveniency  that the best and wisest princes sometimes erred  that it
belonged to the condition of man  and was  therefore  inevitable  and
that the true honor in such cases consisted not in disowning or hiding
the error  but in making ample reparation  that  though i could not
accept what was offered on the terms proposed  our treaty might go on 
and its articles be prepared and considered  and  in the mean time  i
hoped his danish majesty would reconsider the offer  and make it more
adequate to the loss we had sustained  thus that matter rests  but i
hourly expect to hear further  and perhaps may have more to say on it
before the ship s departure 

i shall be glad to have the proceedings you mention respecting the
brig providentia  i hope the equity and justice of our admiralty
courts  respecting the property of strangers  will always maintain
their reputation  and i wish particularly to cultivate the disposition
of friendship towards us  apparent in the late proceedings of denmark 
as the danish islands may be of use to our west india commerce  while
the english impolitic restraints continue 

the elector of saxony  as i understand from his minister here  has
thoughts of sending one to congress  and proposing a treaty of
commerce and amity with us  prussia has likewise an inclination to
share in a trade with america  and the minister of that court  though
he has not directly proposed a treaty  has given me a packet of lists
of the several sorts of merchandise they can furnish us with  which he
requests me to send to america for the information of our merchants 

i have received no answer yet from congress to my request of being
dismissed from their service  they should  methinks  reflect  that if
they continue me here  the faults i may henceforth commit  through the
infirmities of age  will be rather theirs than mine  i am glad my
journal afforded you any pleasure  i will  as you desire  endeavor to
continue it  i thank you for the pamphlet  it contains a great deal
of information respecting our finances  we shall  as you advise  avoid
publishing it  but i see they are publishing it in the english papers 
i was glad i had a copy authenticated by the signature of secretary
thompson  by which i could assure count de vergennes  that the money
contract i had made with him was ratified by congress  he having just
before expressed some uneasiness to me at its being so long neglected 
i find it was ratified soon after it was received  but the
ratification  except in that pamphlet  has not yet come to hand  i
have done my best to procure the further loan directed by the
resolution of congress  it was not possible  i have written on that
matter to mr morris  i wish the rest of the estimates of losses and
mischiefs were come to hand  they would still be of use 

mr barclay has in his hands the affair of the alliance and bon homme
richard  i will afford him all the assistance in my power  but it is a
very perplexed business  that expedition  though for particular
reasons under american commissions and colors  was carried on at the
king s expense  and under his orders  m  de chaumont was the agent
appointed by the minister of marine to make the outfit  he was also
chosen by all the captains of the squadron  as appears by an
instrument under their hands  to be their agent  receive  sell  and
divide prizes   c  the crown bought two of them at public sale  and
the money i understand is lodged in the hands of a responsible person
at l orient  m  de chaumont says he has given in his accounts to the
marine  and that he has no more to do with the affair  except to
receive a balance due to him  that account  however  is i believe
unsettled  and the absence of some of the captains is said to make
another difficulty  which retards the completion of the business  i
never paid or received anything relating to that expedition  nor had
any other concern in it  than barely ordering the alliance to join the
squadron at m  de sartine s request  i know not whether the other
captains will not claim a share in what we may obtain from denmark 
though the prizes were made by the alliance  when separate from the
squadron  if so  that is another difficulty in the way of making
abatement in our demand  without their consent 

i am sorry to find  that you have thoughts of quitting the service  i
do not think your place can be easily well supplied  you mention  that
an entire new arrangement  with respect to foreign affairs  is under
consideration  i wish to know whether any notice is likely to be taken
in it of my grandson  he has now gone through an apprenticeship of
near seven years in the ministerial business  and is very capable of
serving the states in that line  as possessing all the requisites of
knowledge  zeal  activity  language  and address  he is well liked
here  and count de vergennes has expressed to me in warm terms his
very good opinion of him  the late swedish ambassador  count de
creutz  who has gone home to be prime minister  desired i would
endeavor to procure his being sent to sweden  with a public character 
assuring me  that he should be glad to receive him there as our
minister  and that he knew it would be pleasing to the king  18  the
present swedish ambassador has also proposed the same thing to me  as
you will see by a letter of his  which i enclose  19  one of the
danish ministers  m  walterstorff  who will probably be sent in a
public character to congress  has also expressed his wish  that my
grandson may be sent to denmark  but it is not my custom to solicit
employments for myself  or any of my family  and i shall not do it in
this case  i only hope  that if he is not to be employed in your new
arrangement  i may be informed of it as soon as possible  that while i
have strength left for it  i may accompany him in a tour to italy 
returning through germany  which i think he may make to more advantage
with me than alone  and which i have long promised to afford him  as a
reward for his faithful service  and his tender filial attachment to
me

_july 25th _ while i was writing the above m  walterstorff came in 
and delivered me a packet from m  rosencrone  the danish prime
minister  containing the project of the treaty with some proposed
alterations  and a paper of reasons in support of them  20  fearing
that we should not have time to copy them  i send herewith the
originals  relying on his promise to furnish me with copies in a few
days  he seemed to think  that the interest of the merchants is
concerned in the immediate conclusion of the treaty  that they may
form their plans of commerce  and wished to know whether i did not
think my general power  above mentioned  sufficient for that purpose 
i told him i thought a particular commission more agreeable to the
forms  but if his danish majesty would be content for the present with
the general authority  formerly given to me  i believed i might
venture to act upon it  reserving by a separate article to congress
the power of shortening the term in case any part of the treaty
should not be to their mind  unless the alteration of such part should
hereafter be agreed on

the prince de deuxponts was lately at paris  and applied to me for
information  respecting a commerce which is desired between the
electorate of bavaria and america  i have it also from a good hand at
the court of vienna  that the emperor is desirous of establishing a
commerce with us from trieste  as well as flanders  and would make a
treaty with us if proposed to him  since our trade is laid open  and
no longer a monopoly to england  all europe seems desirous of sharing
in it  and for that purpose to cultivate our friendship  that it may
be better known everywhere  what sort of people  and what kind of
government they will have to treat with  i prevailed with our friend 
the duc de la rochefoucault  to translate our book of constitutions
into french  and i presented copies to all the foreign ministers  i
send you one herewith  they are much admired by the politicians here 
and it is thought will induce considerable emigrations of substantial
people from different parts of europe to america  it is particularly a
matter of wonder  that in the midst of a cruel war  raging in the
bowels of our country  our sages should have the firmness of mind to
sit down calmly and form such complete plans of government  they add
considerably to the reputation of the united states 

i have mentioned above the port of trieste  with which we may possibly
have a commerce  and i am told that many useful productions and
manufactures of hungary may be had extremely cheap there  but it
becomes necessary first to consider how our mediterranean trade is to
be protected from the corsairs of barbary  you will see by the
enclosed copy of a letter 21  i received from algiers  the danger two
of our ships escaped last winter  i think it not improbable  that
those rovers may be privately encouraged by the english to fall upon
us  and to prevent our interference in the carrying trade  for i have
in london heard it is a maxim among the merchants  that if _there were
no algiers  it would be worth england s while to build one_  i wonder 
however  that the rest of europe do not combine to destroy those
nests  and secure commerce from their future piracies

i made the grand master of malta a present of one of our medals in
silver  writing to him a letter  of which i enclose a copy  22  and i
believe our people will be kindly received in his ports  but that is
not sufficient  and perhaps now we have peace  it will be proper to
send ministers  with suitable presents  to establish a friendship with
the emperor of morocco  and the other barbary states  if possible  mr
jay will inform you of some steps  that have been taken by a person at
alicant  without authority  towards a treaty with that emperor  i send
you herewith a few more of the abovementioned medals  which have given
great satisfaction to this court and nation  i should be glad to know
how they are liked with you

our people  who were prisoners in england  are now all discharged 
during the whole war  those who were in forton prison  near
portsmouth  were much befriended by the constant charitable care of mr
wren  a presbyterian minister there  who spared no pains to assist
them in their sickness and distress  by procuring and distributing
among them the contributions of good christians  and prudently
dispensing the allowance i made them  which gave him a great deal of
trouble  but he went through it cheerfully  i think some public notice
should be taken of this good man  i wish the congress would enable me

                    plan of a treaty with portugal 

plan of a treaty of amity and commerce between her most faithful
majesty  the queen of portugal and algarva  and the united states of
north america 

her most faithful majesty  the queen of portugal and algarva  and the
united states of north america  anxious to fix in an equitable and
permanent manner the regulation  which ought to be observed with
regard to the commerce they wish to establish between their respective
countries  conceive that they cannot more effectually attain this end
than by observing as the basis of their arrangement the most perfect
equality and reciprocity  allowing each party the liberty of making
such interior regulations respecting their commerce and navigation as
may best suit them  resting the advantages of commerce on its
reciprocal utility and the laws of a just concurrence  in consequence
of these principles  and of a mature deliberation  her most faithful
majesty and the united states have agreed on the following articles

amity between her most faithful majesty  the queen of portugal  her

the apostolical nuncio has the honor to send mr franklin the enclosed
note  which he requests he will be pleased to forward to the congress
of the united states of north america  and support it with his credit 

                                                      july 28th  1783 


                                 note 

before the revolution  which has just been completed in north america 
the catholics and missionaries of those provinces depended  as to
their spiritual concerns  on the apostolical vicar  resident in
london  it is well known that this arrangement can no longer exist 
but as it is essential that the catholic subjects of the united states
should have an ecclesiastic to govern them in their religious
concerns  the congregation _de propagandâ fide_ existing at rome for
the establishment and conservation of missions  has come to the
determination of proposing to congress to establish  in some city of
the united states of north america  one of their catholic subjects 
with the powers of apostolical vicar  and in the character of bishop 
or simply in quality of apostolical prefect 

the establishment of an apostolical vicar bishop appears the most
eligible  the more so as the catholic subjects of the united states
would find themselves in a situation to receive confirmation and
orders in their own country  without being obliged to go for that
purpose to the country of a foreign power  and as it might sometimes
happen  that among the subjects of the united states  there might be
no person in a situation to be charged with the spiritual government 
either as bishop or apostolical prefect  it would be necessary  in
such circumstances  that congress should consent to choose him from
among the subjects of a foreign nation the most friendly with the
united states

do not agree to any of the propositions that have been made  either
by us or by their minister here  and they have sent over a plan for
the definitive treaty  which consists merely of the preliminaries
formerly signed  with a short introductory paragraph  and another at
the conclusion  confirming and establishing the said preliminary
articles  my colleagues seem inclined to sign this with mr hartley

i have informed the count de vergennes of the difficulty  which mr
hartley has made to signing at versailles  and this minister has
directed me to say  that nothing ought to prevent your signing at
paris on wednesday next  the day proposed for the signature of the
other treaties  but i request you to fix the hour with mr hartley at
nine o clock in the morning  and to send here an express immediately
after your signature is completed 

m  de vergennes is desirous of being informed of the completion of
your labors at the same time with his own  you receive for wednesday a
note of invitation  as well as for your colleagues and mr hartley  i
presume that the latter will make no difficulty

after a continued course of treating for nine months  the english
ministry have at length come to a resolution to lay aside  for the
present  all the new propositions  that have been made and agreed to 
their own as well as ours  and they offer to sign again as a
definitive treaty  the articles of november the 30th  1782  the
ratifications of which have already been exchanged  we have agreed to
this  and on wednesday next  the third of september  it will be
signed  with all the definitive treaties  establishing a general
peace  which may god long continue

  my dear friend 

enclosed is my letter to mr fox  i beg you would assure him  that my
expressions of esteem for him are not mere professions  i really think
him a _great_ man  and i would not think so if i did not believe he
was at bottom  and would prove himself a _good_ one  guard him against
mistaken notions of the american people  you have deceived yourselves
too long with vain expectations of reaping advantage from our little
discontents  we are more thoroughly an enlightened people  with
respect to our political interests  than perhaps any other under
heaven  every man among us reads  and is so easy in his circumstances
as to have leisure for conversations of improvement  and for acquiring
information  our domestic misunderstandings  when we have them  are of
small extent  though monstrously magnified by your microscopic
newspapers  he who judges from them  that we are on the point of
falling into anarchy  or returning to the obedience of britain  is
like one who being shown some spots in the sun should fancy  that the
whole disk would soon be overspread with them  and that there would be
an end of daylight  the great body of intelligence among our people 
surrounds and overpowers our petty dissensions  as the sun s great
mass of fire diminishes and destroys his spots  do not  therefore  any
longer delay the evacuation of new york  in the vain hope of a new
revolution in your favor  if such a hope has indeed had any effect in
occasioning the delay  it is now nine months since the evacuations
were promised  you expect with reason  that the people of new york
should do your merchants justice in the payment of their old debts 
consider the injustice you do them in keeping them so long out of
their habitations  and out of their business  by which they might have
been enabled to make payment  there is no truth more clear to me than
this  that the great interests of our two countries is a thorough
reconciliation  restraints on the freedom of commerce and intercourse
between us  can afford no advantage equivalent to the mischief they
will do  by keeping up ill humor and promoting a total alienation  let
you and me  my dear friend  do our best towards advancing and securing
that reconciliation  we can do nothing  that will in a dying hour
afford us more solid satisfaction 

i wish you a prosperous journey  and a happy sight of your friends 
present my best respects to your good brother and sister  and believe
me ever  with sincere and great esteem  yours affectionately

                                          passy  september 10th  1783 

  sir 

i have received a letter from a very respectable person in america 
containing the following words  viz 

 it is confidently reported  propagated  and believed by some among
us  that the court of france was at the bottom against our obtaining
the fishery and territory in that great extent  in which both are
secured to us by the treaty  that our minister at that court favored 
or did not oppose this design against us  and that it was entirely
owing to the firmness  sagacity  and disinterestedness of mr adams 
with whom mr jay united  that we have obtained these important
advantages  

it is not my purpose to dispute any share of the honor of that treaty 
which the friends of my colleagues may be disposed to give them  but
having now spent fifty years of my life in public offices and trusts 
and having still one ambition left  that of carrying the character of
fidelity at least to the grave with me  i cannot allow that i was
behind any of them in zeal and faithfulness  i therefore think  that i
ought not to suffer an accusation  which falls little short of treason
to my country  to pass without notice  when the means of effectual
vindication are at hand  you  sir  were a witness of my conduct in
that affair  to you and my other colleagues i appeal  by sending to
each a similar letter with this  and i have no doubt of your
readiness to do a brother commissioner justice  by certificates  that
will entirely destroy the effect of that accusation 

i have the honor to be  with much esteem   c

                                          passy  september 11th  1783 

  sir 

i have been favored with your letter of yesterday  and will answer it
explicitly  i have no reason whatever to believe  that you were averse
to our obtaining the full extent of boundary and fishery secured to us
by the treaty  your conduct respecting them throughout the negotiation
indicated a strong  a steady attachment to both those objects  and in
my opinion promoted the attainment of them 

i remember  that in a conversation  which m  de rayneval  the first
secretary of count de vergennes  had with you and me  in the summer of
1782  you contended for our full right to the fishery  and argued it
on various principles 

your letters to me  when in spain  considered our territory as
extending to the mississippi  and expressed your opinion against
ceding the navigation of that river  in very strong and pointed terms 

in short  sir  i do not recollect the least difference in sentiment
between us respecting the boundaries or fisheries  on the contrary  we
were unanimous and united in adhering to  and insisting on them  nor
did i perceive the least disposition in either of us to recede from
our claims  or be satisfied with less than we obtained 

i have the honor to be  with great respect and esteem   c  23

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on
the 10th of this month  in which you say you have received a letter
from a very respectable person in america  containing the following
words  viz   it is confidently reported  propagated  and believed by
some among us  that the court of france was at the bottom against our
obtaining the fishery and territory in that great extent  in which
both are secured to us by the treaty  that our minister at that court
favored  or did not oppose this design against us  and that it was
entirely owing to the firmness  sagacity  and disinterestedness of mr
adams  with whom mr jay united  that we have obtained those important
advantages  

it is unnecessary for me to say anything upon this subject  more than
to quote the words which i wrote in the evening of the 30th of
november  1782  and which have been received and read in congress 
viz   as soon as i arrived in paris  i waited on mr jay  and learned
from him the rise and progress of the negotiation  nothing that has
happened  since the beginning of the controversy in 1761  has ever
struck me more forcibly or affected me more intimately  than that
entire coincidence of principles and opinion between him and me  in
about three days i went out to passy  and spent the evening with dr
franklin  and entered largely into conversation with him upon the
course and present state of our foreign affairs  i told him my opinion
without reserve of the policy of this court  and of the principles 
wisdom  and firmness with which mr jay had conducted the negotiation
in his sickness and my absence  and that i was determined to support
mr jay to the utmost of my power in pursuit of the same system  the
doctor heard me patiently and said nothing  

 the first conference we had afterwards with mr oswald in considering
one point and another  dr franklin turned to mr jay and said   i am of
your opinion  and will go on with these gentlemen without consulting
this court   he has accordingly met us in most of our conferences  and
has gone on with us in entire harmony and unanimity throughout  and
has been able and useful  both by his sagacity and reputation  in the
whole negotiation   24 

  i have the honor to be  very respectfully  sir 

                                                           john adams

  sir 

i received a few days since  the private letter your excellency did me
the honor of writing to me of the 13th of june  i regret with you the
resignation of the late secretary  your present cares are increased by
it  and it will be difficult to find a successor of equal abilities 

we found no difficulty in deciphering the resolution of congress  the
commissioners have taken no notice of it in our public letter 

i am happy to hear that both the device and workmanship of the medal
are approved with you  as they have the good fortune to be by the best
judges on this side of the water  it has been esteemed a well timed 
as well as a well merited compliment here  and has its good effects 
since the two first  which you mention as received  i have sent by
different opportunities so many  as that every member of congress
might have one  i hope they are come safe to hand by this time 

i wrote a long letter to mr livingston by mr barney  to which i beg
leave to refer  enclosing a copy 

we had  before signing the definitive treaty  received the
ratification of the preliminary articles by his britannic majesty 
exchanged with us by mr hartley for that of the congress  i send
herewith a copy of the first and last clauses 

in a former letter i mentioned the volunteer proceedings of a merchant
at alicant  towards obtaining a treaty between us and the emperor of
morocco  we have since received a letter from a person who says  as
you will see by the copy enclosed  that he is sent by the emperor to
be the bearer of his answer to the united states  and that he is
arrived in spain on his way to paris  he has not yet appeared here 
and we hardly know what answer to give him  i hope the sending a
minister to that court  as recommended in my last  has been taken into
consideration  or at least that some instructions respecting that
nation have been sent to your minister in spain  who is better
situated than we are for such a negotiation  25 

the minister from denmark often speaks to me about the proposed
treaty  of which a copy went by mr barney  no commission to sign it 
nor any instructions from congress relating to it are yet arrived  and
though pressed  i have not ventured to do anything further in the
affair 

i forward herewith a letter to the congress from the city of
hamburg  26  i understand that a good disposition towards us prevails
there  which it may be well to encourage 

no answer has yet been given me from the court of portugal  respecting
the plan of a treaty concerted between its ambassador here and me  he
has been unwell and much in the country  so that i have not seen him
lately  i suspect that the false or exaggerated reports of the
distracted situation of our government  industriously propagated
throughout europe by our enemies  have made an impression in that
kingdom to our disadvantage  and inclined them to hesitate in forming
a connexion with us  questions asked me  and observations made by
several of the foreign ministers here  convince me that the idle
stories of our disunion  contempt of authority  refusal to pay taxes 
 c  have been too much credited  and been very injurious to our
reputation 

i sent before a copy of the letter i wrote to the grand master of
malta  with a present of our medal  with this you will have a copy of
his answer  27  i send also a copy of a note i received from the
pope s nuncio  28  he is very civil on all occasions  and has
mentioned the possibility of an advantageous trade america might have
with the ecclesiastical state  which he says has two good ports 
civita vecchia  and      

this court continues favorable to us  count de vergennes was resolute
in refusing to sign the definitive treaty with england before ours was
signed  the english ministers were offended  but complied  i am
convinced that court will never cease endeavoring to disunite us  we
shall  i hope  be constantly on our guard against those machinations 
for our safety consists in a steady adherence to our friends  and our
reputation in a faithful regard to treaties  and in a grateful conduct
towards our benefactors 

i send herewith sundry memorials recommended to my care by count de
vergennes  viz  one respecting a claim of messieurs fosters  of
bordeaux  one of m  pequet  and one of m  bayard  the congress will
take such notice of them as they shall think proper 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be   c

  my dear friend 

i am at present at bath with my dearest sister  whom i have found as
well as i could have expected  and i hope with reasonable prospect of
recovery in time  i have seen my friends in the ministry  and hope
things will go on well  with them i am sure all is right and firm  the
chief part of the cabinet ministers are out of town  but there will be
a full cabinet held in a few days  in which a specific proposition  in
the nature of a temporary convention  will be given in instructions to
me  i imagine nearly upon the ground of my memorial of may 19th  1783 
which i delivered to the american ministers  viz   american ships not
to bring foreign manufactures into great britain  nor to trade
directly between the british west indies and great britain   all the
rest to be as before the war  i expect that something to this effect
will be their determination in the affair  and if it should be so  i
shall hope not to meet with difficulty on your parts  i want to see
some specific beginning  as to any further proposition respecting the
trade between great britain and the british west indies  i doubt
whether any such can be discussed before the meeting of parliament  i
wish to look forward not only to the continuation of peace between our
two countries  but to the improvement of reconciliation into alliance 
and therefore i wish the two parties to be disposed to accommodate
each other  without the strict account by weights and scales  as
between aliens and strangers  actuated towards each other by no other
principle than cold and equalizing indifference  friendly dispositions
presumed have their fairest chance of being realized  but if we should
set out presuming against them  the good which might have happened may
be prevented  pray remember me to your three colleagues  and to all
friends 

  yours  ever most affectionately

  sir 

mr thaxter  late secretary of mr adams  who is charged with all our
despatches  that were intended to go by the french packet boat  writes
from l orient  that though he arrived there two days before the time
appointed for her sailing  he missed reaching her by four hours  but
another light vessel was fitting  and would sail the 21st instant  in
which he hoped to arrive at new york  nearly as soon as the packet  we
shall send duplicates by the next from hence 

in the meantime i enclose a printed copy of the definitive treaty 
which i hear is ratified  indeed we have the ratification of the
preliminaries 

mr hartley  when he left us  expected to return in three weeks  in
order to proceed with us in forming a treaty of commerce  the new
commission  that was intended for us  is not yet come to hand 

with great respect  i have the honor to be  sir   c

  my dear friend 

i have nothing material to write to you respecting public affairs  but
i cannot let mr adams  who will see you  go without a line to inquire
after your welfare  to inform you of mine  and assure you of my
constant respect and attachment 

i think with you  that your quaker article is a good one  and that men
will in time have sense enough to adopt it  but i fear that time is
not yet come 

what would you think of a proposition  if i should make it  of a
compact between england  france  and america  america would be as
happy as the sabine girls  if she could be the means of uniting in
perpetual peace her father and her husband  what repeated follies are
those repeated wars  you do not want to conquer and govern one
another  why then should you be continually employed in injuring and
destroying one another  how many excellent things might have been done
to promote the internal welfare of each country  what bridges  roads 
canals  and other useful public works and institutions  tending to the
common felicity  might have been made and established with the money
and men foolishly spent  during the last seven centuries by our mad
wars in doing one another mischief  you are near neighbors and each
have very respectable qualities  learn to be quiet and to respect each
other s rights  you are all christians  one is _the most christian
king_  and the other _defender of the faith_  manifest the propriety
of these titles by your future conduct   by this   says christ   shall
all men know that ye are my disciples  if ye love one another   seek
peace  and insure it 

  adieu  yours   c

i received my dear friend s kind letter of the 4th instant from bath 
with your proposed temporary convention  which you desire me to show
to my colleagues  they are both by this time in london  where you will
undoubtedly see and converse with them on the subject  the
apprehension you mention  that the cement of the confederation may be
annihilated   c  has not  i think  any foundation  there is sense
enough in america to take care of their own china vase  i see much in
your papers about our divisions and distractions  but i hear little of
them from america  and i know that most of the letters  said to come
from there with such accounts  are mere london fictions  i will
consider attentively the proposition abovementioned  against the
return of my colleagues  when i hope our commission will have arrived 

i rejoice to hear that your dear sister s recovery advances  and that
your brother is well  please to present my affectionate respects to
them  and believe me ever yours   c

  sir 

enclosed is a copy of my last  which went by the english packet  i
heard after i wrote it  that the french packet putting back by
contrary winds  mr thaxter had an opportunity of getting on board her 
and that she sailed the 26th of september 

the mentioned new commission is not yet come to hand  mr hartley is
not returned  and i hear will stay for the meeting of parliament 
which is to be the 11th instant  and he will not come hither till the
recess for the christmas holidays  mr jay went to england about three
weeks since on some personal affairs  and mr adams followed last week
to see that country  and take some exercise during this vacancy of
business 

this court is now at fontainbleau  but will return to versailles in a
few days  its good disposition towards us continues  the late failure
of payment in the caisse d escompte  an institution similar to the
bank of england  occasioned partly by its having gone too far in
assisting the government with money  and the inability of the
government to support their credit  though extremely desirous of doing
it  is a fresh proof that our not obtaining a further loan was not
occasioned by want of good will to assist us  as some have unjustly
supposed  but by a real want of the means  money is at present
unaccountably scarce here  what is arrived and expected in spain since
the peace it is thought will set things right  the government has
proposed a second lottery for this year  by which they borrow
twentyfour millions  and it is filled readily  this helps  and the
caisse d escompte goes on again with its operations  but it is said
the interest paid by the lottery plan is nearly seven per cent 

i have received the duplicates of your excellency s letter  of the
15th of july  to the commissioners  which is very satisfactory 
though it came to hand but lately  the first sent  via new york  has
not yet appeared  i have sent copies of it to the hague and madrid 
the substance is published in several papers 

i have acquainted the minister of sweden  that i have received the
ratification of the treaty  and he has written to me that he shall be
in town in a few days  when he will make the exchange  the conclusion
of the danish treaty waits only for the commission and instructions
from congress  the ambassador of portugal informed me lately  that his
court had our proposed plan under consideration  and that we should
soon hear from them  i sent it to congress by barney  and hear the
ship is arrived  a commission and instructions will be wanting for
that also  should the congress be disposed to conclude a treaty with
that nation 

i see by the public prints  that the congress have ratified the
contract i made with the minister here  respecting the loans and aids
we had received  but the ratification itself  though directed to be
sent me  has never come to hand  and i am often asked for it  i beg it
may be forwarded by the first opportunity 

there has been with me lately m  pierre du calvet  a merchant of
montreal  who  when our army was in canada  furnished our generals and
officers with many things they wanted  taking their receipts and
promissory notes for payment  and when the english repossessed the
country  he was imprisoned  and his estate seized  on account of the
services he had rendered us  he has shown me the originals of his
papers  which i think are genuine  he produced also a quantity of
congress paper  which he says he received in payment for some of the
supplies  and which appeared to me of our first emissions  and yet
all fresh and clean  as having passed through no other hands  when he
was discharged from prison  he could not obtain permission to go into
the united states to claim the debt  but was allowed to go to england 
and from thence he came hither to solicit payment from me  having no
authority to meddle with such debts  and the sum being considerable  i
refused  and advised him to take passage for america  and make his
application to congress  he said he was grown old  much broken and
weakened by near three years  imprisonment  and that the voyage from
canada to london had like to have been too much for him  he being sick
all the way  so that he could not think of another  though distressed
for want of his money  he appears an honest man  and his case a hard
one  i have therefore undertaken to forward his papers  and i beg
leave to recommend them to the speedy consideration of congress  to
whom i request you would be pleased to present my dutiful respects 
and assure them of my most faithful services 

with great esteem and regard   c

  sir 

on the 15th of july last  i had the honor to acquaint your excellency
of my arrival in europe  and that i was appointed by his majesty  the
emperor of morocco  bearer of the answer to the congress  sovereign of
the thirteen united states of north america  and that according to my
instructions  i was to meet at paris the ambassador  that would be
appointed by the congress  to sign at the court of morocco the treaty
of peace and commerce  agreeably to the proposals made to his imperial
majesty  by robert montgomery  in his letter dated at alicant  the 4th
of january  1783  since i have been at the court of madrid  where i
had some commissions from the emperor  and to see the execution of
them  i came to this place  from whence i intend to embark in three or
four months for barbary  unless in the meantime i should receive an
answer from your excellency  with orders  that mr richard harrison
should give me for my travelling charges fifteen hundred hard dollars 
although the courts of europe are accustomed to allow the ministers of
my master at the rate of ten pounds sterling per day  while they are
in europe  to defray their expenses  besides presents for their good
offices in those important affairs 

his imperial majesty was graciously pleased at my solicitation to
agree at the request of congress  to grant them a treaty of peace 
 which other powers in europe could not obtain but after many years 
and my return  without the full execution of his commands  i apprehend
may forever indispose him against the united provinces 

  i remain most truly  sir   c

                                           passy  december 15th  1783 

  my dear friend 

i am much concerned to find by your letter to my grandson  that you
are hurt by my long silence  and that you ascribe it to a supposed
diminution of my friendship  believe me  that is by no means the
case  but i am too much harassed by a variety of correspondence 
together with gout and gravel  which induce me to postpone doing what
i often fully intend to do  and particularly writing  where the urgent
necessity of business does not seem to require its being done
immediately  my sitting too much at the desk having already almost
killed me  besides  since mr jay s residence here  i imagined he might
keep you fully informed of what was material for you to know  and i
beg you to be assured of my constant and sincere esteem and affection 

i do not know whether you have been informed  that a mr montgomery 
who lives at alicant  took upon himself   for i think he had no
authority   to make overtures last winter in behalf of our states 
towards a treaty with the emperor of morocco  in consequence of his
proceedings i received a letter in august  from a person who
acquainted me  that he was arrived in spain by the emperor s order 
and was to come to paris  there to receive and conduct to morocco the
minister of congress appointed to make that treaty  intimating at the
same time an expectation of money to defray his expenses  i
communicated the letter to mr jay  the conduct of mr montgomery
appeared to us very extraordinary and irregular  and the idea of a
messenger from morocco coming to paris to meet and conduct a minister
of congress appearing absurd and extravagant  as well as the demand of
money by a person unknown  i made no answer to the letter  and i know
not whether mr jay made any to mr montgomery  who wrote about the same
time  but i have lately received another letter from the same person 
a copy of which i enclose  together with my answer open for your
perusal  and it is submitted to your discretion whether to forward it
or not  the mr _crocco_  who writes to me  having been  as he says  at
madrid  you possibly may know more of him than i can  and judge
whether he is really a person in credit with the emperor  and sent as
he pretends to be  or not rather an _escroc_  as the french call
cheats and impostors 

i would not be wanting in anything proper for me to do towards keeping
that prince in good humor with us  till the pleasure of congress is
known  and therefore would answer mr crocco if he be in his employ 
but am loth to commit myself in correspondence with a _fripon_  it
will be strange if  being at madrid  he did not address himself to
you 

with great and unalterable regard  i am ever  my dear friend  yours
most affectionately

  sir 

i have just received the letter you did me the honor of writing to me
the 25th past  i did indeed receive your former letter of july  but
being totally a stranger to the mentioned proceedings of mr
montgomery  and having no orders from congress on the subject  i knew
not how to give you any satisfactory answer  till i should receive
further information  and i communicated your letter to mr jay 
minister of the united states for spain  in whose district mr
montgomery is  and who is more at hand than i am for commencing that
negotiation 

mr jay  who is at present in england  has possibly written to you 
though his letter may have miscarried  to acquaint you  that mr
montgomery had probably no authority from congress to take the step he
has done  and that it was not likely that they  desiring to make a
treaty with the emperor  would think of putting his majesty to the
trouble of sending a person to paris to receive and conduct their
minister  since they have ships  and could easily land him at cadiz 
or present him at one of the emperor s ports  we have  however 
written to congress  acquainting them with what we had been informed 
of the good and favorable disposition of his imperial majesty  to
enter into a treaty of amity and commerce with the united states  and
we have no doubt but that  as soon as their affairs are a little
settled  which  by so severe a war carried on in the bowels of their
country  by one of the most powerful nations of europe  have
necessarily been much deranged  they will readily manifest equally
good dispositions  and take all the proper steps to cultivate and
secure the friendship of a monarch  whose character i know they have
long esteemed and respected 

  i am  sir   c

                                           passy  december 25th  1783 

  sir 

not having heard of the appointment of a new secretary for foreign
affairs  i take the liberty of addressing this despatch directly to
your excellency  i received by captain barney a letter from the late
president  directed to the commissioners  dated november the 1st  with
a set of instructions  dated the 29th of october  a resolution of the
same date respecting hamburg  and another of the 1st of november 
relating to captain paul jones  all which will be duly regarded 

captain jones  in passing through england  communicated these papers
to mr adams then at london  mr adams  disappointed in not finding
among them the commission we had been made to expect  empowering us to
make a treaty of commerce with england  wrote to me  that he imagined
it might be contained in a packet that was directed to me  and
requested to be immediately informed  adding  that in case no such
commission was come he should depart directly for holland  so i
suppose he is now there  mr laurens is gone to england  with an
intention of embarking soon for america  mr jay is at bath  but
expected here daily  the english ministers  the duke of manchester and
mr hartley  are both at present in parliament  as soon as either of
them returns  we shall endeavor to obtain an additional article to the
treaty  explaining that mentioned in the instructions 

the affairs of ireland are still unsettled  the parliament and
volunteers are at variance  the latter are uneasy  that in the late
negotiations for a treaty of commerce between england and america  the
british ministers had made no mention of ireland  and they seem to
desire a separate treaty of commerce between america and that kingdom 

it was certainly disagreeable to the english ministers  that all their
treaties for peace were carried on under the eye of the french court 
this began to appear towards the conclusion  when mr hartley refused
going to versailles  to sign there with the other powers our
definitive treaty  and insisted on its being done at paris  which we
in good humor complied with  but at an earlier hour  that we might
have time to acquaint count de vergennes before he was to sign with
the duke of manchester 

the dutch definitive treaty was not then ready  and the british court
now insists on finishing it either at london or the hague  if 
therefore  the commission to us  which has been so long delayed  is
still intended  perhaps it will be well to instruct us to treat either
here or at london  as we may find most convenient 

the treaty may be conducted  even there  in concert and in the
confidence of communication with the ministers of our friends  whose
advice may be of use to us 

with respect to the british court  we should  i think  be constantly
upon our guard  and impress strongly upon our minds  that though it
has made peace with us  it is not in truth reconciled either to us  or
to its loss of us  but still flatters itself with hopes  that some
change in the affairs of europe  or some disunion among ourselves  may
afford them an opportunity of recovering their dominion  punishing
those who have most offended  and securing our future dependence  it
is easy to see by the general turn of the ministerial newspapers 
 light things  indeed  as straws and feathers  but like them they show
which way the wind blows  and by the malignant improvement their
ministers make  in all the foreign courts  of every little accident or
dissension among us  the riot of a few soldiers at philadelphia  the
resolves of some town meetings  the reluctance to pay taxes   c  all
which are exaggerated  to represent our government as so many
anarchies  of which the people themselves are weary  and the congress
as having lost its influence  being no longer respected  i say it is
easy to see from this conduct  that they bear us no good will  and
that they wish the reality of what they are pleased to imagine  they
have  too  a numerous royal progeny to provide for  some of whom are
educated in the military line  in these circumstances we cannot be too
careful to preserve the friendships we have acquired abroad  and the
union we have established at home  to secure our credit by a punctual
discharge of our obligations of every kind  and our reputation by the
wisdom of our councils  since we know not how soon we may have a fresh
occasion for friends  for credit  and for reputation 

the extravagant misrepresentations of our political state in foreign
countries  made it appear necessary to give them better information 
which i thought could not be more effectually and authentically done 
than by publishing a translation into french  now the most general
language in europe  of the book of constitutions  which had been
printed by order of congress  this i accordingly got well done  and
presented two copies handsomely bound to every foreign minister here 
the one for himself  the other more elegant for his sovereign  it has
been well taken  and has afforded matter of surprise to many  who had
conceived mean ideas of the state of civilization in america  and
could not have expected so much political knowledge and sagacity had
existed in our wilderness  and from all parts i have the satisfaction
to hear  that our constitutions in general are much admired  i am
persuaded  that this step will not only tend to promote the emigration
to our country of substantial people from all parts of europe  by the
numerous copies i shall disperse  but will facilitate our future
treaties with foreign courts  who could not before know what kind of
government and people they had to treat with  as  in doing this  i
have endeavored to further the apparent views of congress in the first
publication  i hope it may be approved  and the expense allowed  i
send herewith one of the copies 

our treaties with denmark and portugal remain unfinished  for want of
instructions respecting them from congress  and a commission
empowering some minister or ministers to conclude them  the emperor of
morocco  we understand  has expressed a disposition to make a treaty
of amity and commerce with the united states  a mr montgomery  who is
a merchant settled at alicant  has been  it seems  rather forward in
proposing a negotiation  without authority for so doing  and has
embarrassed us a little  as may be seen by some letters i enclose  30 
perhaps it would be well for the congress to send a message to that
prince  expressing their respect and regard for him  till such time as
they may judge it convenient to appoint an ambassador in form 
furnished with proper presents to make a treaty with him  the other
barbary states  too  seem to require consideration  if we propose to
carry on any trade in the mediterranean  but whether the security of
that trade is of sufficient importance to be worth purchasing  at the
rate of the tributes usually exacted by those piratical states  is a
matter of doubt  on which i cannot at present form a judgment

i shall immediately proceed  in pursuance of the first instruction  to
take the proper steps for acquainting his imperial majesty of germany
with the dispositions of congress  having some reason to believe the
overture may be acceptable  his minister here is of late extremely
civil to me  and we are on very good terms  i have likewise an
intimate friend at that court 

with respect to other powers  it seems best not to make advances at
present  but to meet and encourage them when made  which i shall not
fail to do  as i have already done those of sweden  denmark  and
portugal  possibly hamburg  to whom i have forwarded the letter of
congress  may send a minister to america if they wish for a treaty to
conclude it there  they have no minister here 

i have lately received a memorial from the minister of denmark 
respecting a ship of that nation  the providentia  taken by one of our
privateers and carried into boston  i enclose a copy of it  and
request to be furnished with directions and informations for the
answer  it may be well to send me a copy of the proceedings in the
courts  from a perusal of the papers communicated with it  i am
satisfied that the cargo was clearly british property 

we have hitherto entered into no engagements respecting the armed
neutrality  and  in obedience to the fifth instruction  we shall take
care to avoid them hereafter  the treaty between this court and the
united states for regulating the powers  privileges   c  of consuls 
is at length completed  and is transcribing in order to be signed  i
hope to transmit a copy by the next packet  i have received the
congress ratification of the two money treaties  which will be soon
exchanged  when i shall send copies of them with that of sweden 

i have given  and shall continue to give  captain paul jones all the
assistance in my power  towards recovering the prize money  and i hope
it may soon be accomplished 

when mr jay returns  i shall desire him to make the inquiry directed
in the fourth instruction  respecting the expedition under that
commodore  and report thereon to congress  in the meantime i can
answer respecting one of the questions  that the king paid the whole
expense  and that no part of it has ever been placed to the account of
congress  there exists indeed a demand of one puchelberg  a person in
the employ of m  schweighauser  of about thirty thousand livres  for
provisions and other things furnished to captain landais  after he
took the alliance out of the hands of captain jones  but as the ship
was at that time under the king s supply  who having borrowed her for
the expedition when fitted for sea  and just ready to sail with mr
adams  had ordered her to be delivered in the same condition  free of
all charges accrued  or accruing  by her being in holland and in
l orient  and as m  puchelberg had not only no orders from me to
furnish captain landais  but acted contrary to my orders given to m 
schweighauser  and contrary to the orders of m  schweighauser himself 
i refused to pay his account  which besides appeared extravagant  and
it has never yet been paid 

i shall do my best in executing the third instruction  respecting our
claim upon denmark  i have written to london to obtain if possible an
account of the sums insured upon the ships delivered up  as such an
account may be some guide in the valuation of the prizes 

a captain williams  formerly in the british service  and employed upon
the lakes  has given me a paper containing information of the state of
the back country  as those informations may possibly be of some use  i
send herewith the paper  mr carmichael has sent me the accounts of the
money transactions at madrid  as soon as mr jay returns they will be
examined 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  and assure them
of my most faithful services

  sir 

the remissness of our people in paying taxes is highly blameable  the
unwillingness to pay them is still more so  i see in some resolutions
of town meetings  a remonstrance against giving congress a power to
take  as they call it  _the people s money_ out of their pockets 
though only to pay the interest and principal of debts duly
contracted  they seem to mistake the point  money justly due from the
people is their creditor s money  and no longer the money of the
people  who if they withhold it should be compelled to pay by some
law  all property indeed  except the savage s temporary cabin  his
bow  his matchuat  and other little acquisitions absolutely necessary
for his subsistence  seems to me to be the creature of public
convention  hence the public has the right of regulating descents  and
all other conveyances of property  and even of limiting the quantity
and uses of it  all the property that is necessary to a man for the
conservation of the individual  and the propagation of the species  is
his natural right  which none can justly deprive him of  but all
property superfluous to such purposes is the property of the public 
who by their laws have created it  and who may therefore by other laws
dispose of it whenever the welfare of the public shall desire such
disposition  he that does not like civil society on these terms  let
him retire and live among the savages  he can have no right to the
benefits of society  who will not pay his club towards the support of
it 

the marquis de lafayette  who loves to be employed in our affairs  and
is often very useful  has lately had several conversations with the
ministers and persons concerned in forming new regulations  respecting
the commerce between our two countries  which are not yet concluded  i
thought it therefore well to communicate to him a copy of your letter 
which contains so many sensible and just observations on that subject 
he will make a proper use of them  and perhaps they may have more
weight  as appearing to come from a frenchman  than they would have if
it were known  that they were the observations of an american  i
perfectly agree with you in all the sentiments you have expressed on
this occasion 

i am sorry for the public s sake  that you are about to quit your
office  but on personal considerations  i shall congratulate you  for
i cannot conceive of a more happy man  than he who having been long
loaded with public cares finds himself relieved from them  and
enjoying private repose in the bosom of his friends and family 

with sincere regard and attachment  i am ever  dear sir  yours   c

  sir 

if the congress should think it fit to have a consul for the united
states in london  and do not appoint one of our own countrymen to that
office  i beg leave to mention the merits of mr william hodgson  a
merchant of that city  who has always been a zealous friend of
america  was a principal promoter of the subscription for the relief
of american prisoners  and chairman of the committee for dispensing
the money raised by that subscription  he also took the trouble of
applying the monies i furnished him with  when the subscription was
exhausted  and constantly assisted me in all the negotiations i had
with the british ministers  in their favor  wherein he generally
succeeded  being a man of weight and credit  very active  and much
esteemed for his probity and integrity  these his services  continued
steadily during the whole war  seem to entitle him to the favorable
notice of congress  when any occasion offers of doing him service or
pleasure 

with great respect  i have the honor to be   c

  my dear friend 

will you be so good as to transmit the enclosed to mr jay  i am sorry
that we are going to lose him from this side of the atlantic  if your
american ratification should arrive speedily  i might hope to have the
pleasure of seeing him again before his departure  as soon as i hear
from you of the arrival of your ratification i will immediately apply
for the despatch of the british ratification  i wish very much to have
the pleasure of conversing with you again  in hopes that that time may
come soon  i have nothing further to say at present  believe me always
to be  what you have always known me to have been  a friend of general
philanthropy  and particularly your ever  most affectionate

  sir 

i received a few days since a letter from annapolis  dated june the
5th  in your hand writing  but not signed  acquainting the
commissioners with the causes of delay in sending the ratification of
the definitive treaty  the term was expired before that letter came to
hand  but i hope no difficulty will arise from a failure in a point
not essential  and which was occasioned by accidents  i have just
received from mr hartley a letter on the subject  of which i enclose a
copy 

we have had a terrible winter  too  here  such as the oldest men do
not remember  and indeed it has been very severe all over europe 

i have exchanged ratifications with the ambassador of sweden  and
enclose a copy of that i received from him 

mr jay is lately returned from england  mr laurens is still there  but
proposes departing for america next month  as does also mr jay  with
his family  mr adams is in holland  where he has been detained by
business and bad weather  these absences have occasioned some delays
in our business  but not of much importance 

the war long expected between the turks and russians is prevented by a
treaty  and it is thought an accommodation will likewise take place
between them and the emperor  everything here continues friendly and
favorable to the united states  i am pestered continually with numbers
of letters from people in different parts of europe  who would go to
settle in america  but who manifest very extravagant expectations 
such as i can by no means encourage  and who appear otherwise to be
very improper persons  to save myself trouble  i have just printed
some copies of the enclosed little piece  which i purpose to send
hereafter in answer to such letters 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to congress  and believe me
to be  with sincere esteem  dear sir   c

  sir 

in my last i acquainted your excellency  that mr hartley was soon
expected here to exchange ratifications of the definitive treaty  he
is now arrived  and proposes to make the exchange this afternoon  i
shall then be enabled to send a copy  enclosed is the new british
proclamation respecting our trade with their colonies  it is said to
be a temporary provision  till parliament can assemble and make some
proper regulating law  or till a commercial treaty shall be framed and
agreed to  mr hartley expects instructions for planning with us such a
treaty  the ministry are supposed to have been too busy with the new
elections  when he left london  to think of those matters 

this court has not completed its intended new system for the trade of
their colonies  so that i cannot yet give a certain account of the
advantages that will in fine be allowed us  at present it is said we
are to have two free ports  tobago and the mole  and that we may carry
lumber and all sorts of provisions to the rest  except flour  which is
reserved in favor of bordeaux  and that we shall be permitted to
export coffee  rum  molasses  and some sugar  for our own
consumption 

we have had under consideration a commercial treaty proposed to us by
the king of prussia  and have sent it back with our remarks to mr
adams  who will i suppose transmit it immediately to congress  those
planned with denmark and portugal wait its determination 

be pleased to present my dutiful respects to the congress  and believe
me to be  with sincere and great esteem  sir   c

  sir 

i have the honor to inform you  that i have transmitted to london the
ratification on the part of congress of the definitive treaty of
peace  between great britain and the united states of america  and i
am ordered to represent to you  that a want of form appears in the
first paragraph of that instrument  wherein the united states are
mentioned before his majesty  contrary to the established custom in
every treaty in which a crowned head and a republic are parties  it is
likewise to be observed  that the term definitive _articles_ is used
instead of definitive _treaty_  and the conclusion appears likewise
deficient  as it is neither signed by the president  nor is it dated 
and consequently  is wanting in some of the most essential points of
form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument 

i am ordered to propose to you  sir  that these defects in the
ratification should be corrected  which might very easily be done 
either by signing a declaration in the name of congress for preventing
the particular mode of expression  so far as it relates to precedency
in the first paragraph  being considered as a precedent to be adopted
on any future occasion  or else by having a new copy made out in
america  in which these mistakes should be corrected  and which might
be done without any prejudice arising to either of the parties from
the delay 

i am  sir  with great respect and consideration   c 

                                                        david hartley

                                                 passy  june 2d  1784 

  sir 

i have considered the observations you did me the honor of
communicating to me  concerning certain inaccuracies of expression 
and supposed defects of formality  in the instrument of ratification 
some of which are said to be of such a nature as to affect the
validity of the instrument 

the first is   that the united states are named before his majesty 
contrary to the established custom observed in every treaty in which a
crowned head and a republic are the contracting parties   with respect
to this  it seems to me we should distinguish between that act in
which both join  to wit  the treaty  and that which is the act of each
separately  the ratification  it is necessary  that all the modes of
expression in the joint act should be agreed to by both parties 
though in their separate acts each party is master of  and alone
unaccountable for its own mode  and  on inspecting the treaty  it will
be found that his majesty is always regularly named before the united
states  thus   the established custom _in treaties_ between crowned
heads and republics   contended for on your part  is strictly
observed  and the ratification following the treaty contains these
words   now know ye  that we  the united states in congress assembled 
having seen and considered the definitive articles aforesaid  have
_approved_  _ratified_  and _confirmed_  and by these presents do
_approve_  _ratify_  and _confirm_ the said articles  and every part
and clause thereof    c  hereby all those articles  parts  and
clauses  wherein the king is named before the united states  are
_approved_  _ratified_  and _confirmed_  and this solemnly under the
signature of the president of congress  with the public seal affixed
by their order  and countersigned by their secretary 

no declaration on the subject more determinate or more authentic can
possibly be made or given  which  when considered  may probably induce
his majesty s ministers to waive the proposition of our signing a
similar declaration  or of sending back the ratification to be
corrected in this point  neither appearing to be really necessary  i
will  however  if it be still desired  transmit to congress the
observation  and the difficulty occasioned by it  and request their
orders upon it  in the meantime i may venture to say  that i am
confident there was no intention of affronting his majesty by their
order of nomination  but that it resulted merely from that sort of
complaisance  which every nation seems to have for itself  and of that
respect for its own government  customarily so expressed in its own
acts  of which the english among the rest afford an instance  when in
the title of the king they always name great britain before france 

the second objection is   that the term definitive _articles_ is used
instead of definitive _treaty_  if the words _definitive treaty_ had
been used in the ratification instead of _definitive articles_  it
might have been more correct  though the difference seems not great
nor of much importance  as in the treaty itself it is called the
present _definitive treaty_ 

the other objections are   that the conclusion likewise appears
deficient  as if is neither signed by the president  nor is it dated 
and consequently is wanting in some of the most essential points of
form necessary towards authenticating the validity of the instrument  
the situation of seals and signatures  in public instruments  differs
in different countries  though all equally valid  for when all the
parts of an instrument are connected by a ribband  whose ends are
secured under the impression of the seal  the signature and seal
wherever placed are understood as relating to and authenticating the
whole  our usage is  to place them both together in the broad margin
near the beginning of the piece  and so they stand in the present
ratification  the concluding words of which declare the intention of
such signing and sealing to be giving authenticity to the whole
instrument  viz   _in testimony_ whereof  we have _caused_ the seal of
the united states to be hereunto affixed  witness his excellency
thomas mifflin  esquire  president   and the date supposed to be
omitted  perhaps from its not appearing in figures  is nevertheless to
be found written in words at length  viz   this fourteenth day of
january  in the year of our lord one thousand seven hundred
eightyfour   which made the figures unnecessary 

with great esteem and respect  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

my letter by mr jay acquainted your excellency  that the ratifications
of the definitive treaty were exchanged  a copy of the british part
was also sent by him 

mr hartley remained here expecting instructions to treat with us on
the subject of commerce  the bustle attending a new election and
meeting of parliament  he imagined might occasion the long delay of
those instructions  he now thinks that the affair of the american
trade  being under the consideration of parliament  it is probable no
treaty will be proposed till the result is known  mr jay  who sailed
for america the first instant from dover  and who saw there several of
our friends from london before his departure  and mr laurens who left
london the 6th to go on in the falmouth packet  will be able to give
you more perfect informations than i can  of what may be expected as
the determination of the british government respecting our intercourse
with their islands  and  therefore  i omit my conjectures  only
mentioning  that from various circumstances there seems to be some
lurking remains of ill humor there  and of resentment against us 
which only wants a favorable opportunity to manifest itself 

this makes it more necessary for us to be upon our guard  and prepared
for events  that a change in the affairs of europe may produce  its
tranquillity depending  perhaps  on the life of one man  and it being
impossible to foresee in what situation a new arrangement of its
various interests may place us  ours will be respected in proportion
to the apparent solidity of our government  the support of our credit 
the maintenance of a good understanding with our friends  and our
readiness for defence  all which i persuade myself will be taken care
of 

enclosed i send a copy of a letter from mr hartley to me  respecting
some supposed defects in the ratification  together with my answer 
which he has transmitted to london  the objections appeared to me
trivial and absurd  but i thought it prudent to treat them with as
much decency as i could  lest the ill temper should be augmented 
which might be particularly inconvenient  while the commerce was under
consideration  there has not yet been time for mr hartley to hear
whether my answer has been satisfactory  or whether the ministers will
still insist on my sending for an amended copy from america  as they
proposed 

i do not perceive the least diminution in the good disposition of this
court towards us  and i hope care will be taken to preserve it 

the marquis de lafayette  who will have the honor of delivering this
to you  has  ever since his arrival in europe  been very industrious
in his endeavors to serve us and promote our interests  and has been
of great use on several occasions  i should wish the congress might
think fit to express in some proper manner their sense of his merit 

my malady prevents my going to versailles  as i cannot bear a carriage
upon pavement  but my grandson goes regularly on court days to supply
my place  and is well received there  the last letters i have had the
honor of receiving from you  are of the 14th of january 

  with great respect  i am  sir   c

instructions of congress to their late commissioners for treating of
peace  expressing their desire to cultivate the friendship of his
imperial majesty  and to enter into a treaty of commerce for the
mutual advantage of his subjects and the citizens of the united
states  which i request you will be pleased to lay before his majesty 
the appointing and instructing commissioners for treaties of commerce
with the powers of europe generally has  by various circumstances 
been long delayed  but is now done  and i have just received advice 
that mr jefferson  late governor of virginia  commissioned with mr
adams  our minister in holland  and myself  for that service  is on
his way hither  and may be expected by the end of august  when we

  sir 

i have received the letter you did me the honor to write to me this
morning  and i shall lose no time to transmit the contents to my
court 

the sentiments of the emperor towards the united states of america
make me foresee the satisfaction  which his majesty will have to enter
into reciprocal  suitable  and advantageous connexions with them  i
have not the least doubt but that measures will be instantly taken on
this subject to concert with you  sir  and with the appointed
ministers plenipotentiary  and as soon as the answer from my court

  sir 

you have communicated to me an extract from the instructions  which
congress addressed to you on the 11th of may last  which imports that
the united states will in no case treat any other nation with respect
to commerce more advantageously than the french  this disposition is
much the wisest  as it will prevent those misunderstandings  which
might arise from the equivocal terms in which the 2d article of the
treaty of amity and commerce  signed february 6th  1778  is conceived 
but that the resolution of congress on this subject may be clearly
stated  it would be best  sir  that you furnish me with it in the form
of a declaration  or at least in an official note  signed by yourself 
i have no doubt that you will adopt one of these two forms 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have the honor to transmit to your excellency  by order of congress 
a resolution of theirs  dated the 11th of may last  which is in the
words following  viz 

 _resolved_  that doctor franklin be instructed to express to the
court of france  the constant desire of congress to meet their wishes 
that these states are about to form a general system of commerce  by
treaties with other nations  that  at this time  they cannot foresee
what claim might be given to those nations by the explanatory
propositions from the count de vergennes  on the 2d and 3d articles of
our treaty of amity and commerce with his most christian majesty  but
that he may be assured it will be our constant care to place no people
on more advantageous ground than the subjects of his majesty  

  with great respect  i am   c

  dear sir 

it was intended by the commissioners to write a joint letter to
congress  but i am afraid the opportunity may be missed  this may
serve to inform you  that propositions of treating have been made by
us to all the powers of europe according to our instructions  and we
are waiting for their answers  there are apprehensions here of a war
between the emperor and holland  but  as the season is not proper for
opening a campaign  i hope the winter will give time for mediators to
accommodate matters  we have not yet heard that mr jay has accepted
the secretaryship of foreign affairs 

i am ever  my dear friend  yours most affectionately

  dear friend 

i received your kind letter of august 13th  with the papers annexed 
relative to the affair of longchamps  i hope satisfaction will be
given to m  marbois  the commissioners have written a joint letter to
congress  this serves to cover a few papers relative to matters with
which i was particularly charged in the instructions  i shall write to
you fully by the next opportunity  having now only time to add  that i
am  as ever 

  yours most affectionately

_p  s _ i executed the instructions of october 29th  1783  as soon as
i knew the commissions for treating with the emperor   c  were issued 
which was not till july  1784  the three letters between the emperor s
minister and me are what passed on that occasion 

                                                                 b  f

  sir 

i received by the marquis de lafayette the two letters you did me the
honor of writing to me the 11th and 14th of december  the one
enclosing a letter from congress to the king  the other a resolve of
congress respecting the convention for establishing consuls  the
letter was immediately delivered and well received  the resolve came
too late to suspend signing the convention  it having been done july
last  and a copy sent so long since  that we now expected the
ratification  as that copy seems to have miscarried i now send
another 

i am not informed what objection has arisen in congress to the plan
sent me  mr jefferson thinks it may have been to the part  which
restrained the consuls from all concern in commerce  that article was
omitted  being thought unnecessary to be stipulated  since either
party would always have the power of imposing such restraints on its
own officers  whenever it should think fit  i am  however  of opinion
that this or any other reasonable article or alteration may be
obtained at the desire of congress  and established by a supplement 

permit me  sir  to congratulate you on your being called to the high
honor of presiding in our national councils  and to wish you every
felicity  being with the most perfect esteem   c

  sir 

m  de chaumont  who will have the honor of presenting this line to
your excellency  is a young gentleman of excellent character  whose
father was one of our most early friends in this country  which he
manifested by crediting us with a thousand barrels of gunpowder and
other military stores in 1776  before we had provided any apparent
means of payment  he has  as i understand  some demands to make on
congress  the nature of which i am unacquainted with  but my regard
for the family makes me wish  that they may obtain a speedy
consideration  and such favorable issue as they may appear to merit

  sir 

i have the honor to acquaint your excellency  that i have at length
obtained  and yesterday received  the permission of congress to return
to america  as my malady makes it impracticable for me to pay my
devoirs at versailles personally  may i beg the favor of you  sir  to
express respectfully for me to his majesty  the deep sense i have of
all the inestimable benefits his goodness has conferred on my country 
a sentiment that it will be the business of the little remainder of
life now left me  to impress equally on the minds of all my
countrymen  my sincere prayers are  that god may shower down his
blessings on the king  the queen  their children  and all the royal
family  to the latest generations 

permit me  at the same time  to offer you my thankful acknowledgments
for the protection and countenance you afforded me at my arrival  and
your many favors during my residence here  of which i shall always
retain the most grateful remembrance 

my grandson would have had the honor of waiting on you with this
letter  but he has been some time ill of a fever 

with the greatest esteem and respect  and best wishes for the constant
prosperity of yourself  and all your amiable family  i am  sir  your
excellency s most obedient and most humble servant

  dear sir 

an old gentleman in switzerland  long of the magistracy there  having
written a book entitled _du gouvernement des moeurs_  which is thought
to contain many matters  that may be useful in america  desired to
know of me how he could convey a number of the printed copies  to be
distributed gratis among the members of congress  i advised his
addressing the package to you by way of amsterdam  whence a friend of
mine would forward it  it is accordingly shipped there on board the
van berckel  captain w  campbell  there are good things in the work 
but his chapter on the liberty of the press appears to me to contain
more rhetoric than reason 

  with great esteem i am  ever   c

  sir 

i have learnt with much concern of your retiring  and of your
approaching departure for america  you cannot doubt but that the
regrets  which you will leave  will be proportionate to the
consideration you so justly enjoy 

i can assure you  sir  that the esteem the king entertains for you 
does not leave you anything to wish  and that his majesty will learn
with real satisfaction  that your fellow citizens have rewarded  in a
manner worthy of you  the important services that you have rendered
them 

i beg  sir  that you will preserve for me a share in your remembrance 
and never doubt the sincerity of the interest i take in your
happiness  it is founded on the sentiments of attachment of which i
have assured you  and with which i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

with respect to my continuing to charge £2500 sterling per annum as my
salary  of which you desire some explanation  i send you  in support
of that charge  the resolution of congress  which is in these words 

 in congress  october 5th  1779  resolved  that each of the ministers
plenipotentiary be allowed at the rate of two thousand five hundred
pounds sterling per annum  and each of their secretaries at the rate
of one thousand pounds sterling per annum  in full for their services
and expenses respectively  that the salary of each of the said
officers be computed from the time of his leaving his place of abode 
to enter on the duties of his office  and be continued three months
after the notice of his recall  

the several bills i afterwards received  drawn on the congress banker 
mr grand  for my salary  were all calculated on that sum  as my
salary  and neither the banker nor myself has received notice of any
change respecting me  he has accordingly  since the drawing ceased 
continued to pay me at the same rate  i have  indeed  heard that a
resolution was passed last year  that the salaries of plenipotentiaries
should be no more than £2000 sterling per annum  but the resolution  i
suppose  can relate only to such plenipotentiaries as should be
afterwards appointed  for i cannot conceive that the congress  after
promising a minister £2500 a year  and when he has thereby been
encouraged to engage in a way of living for their honor  which only
that salary can support  would think it just to diminish it a fifth 
and leave him under the difficulty of reducing his expenses
proportionably  a thing scarce practicable  the necessity of which he
might have avoided  if he had not confided in their original promise 

but the article of salary  with all the rest of my accounts  will be
submitted to the judgment of congress  together with some other
considerable articles i have not charged  but on which i shall expect 
from their equity  some consideration  if  for want of knowing
precisely the intention of congress  what expenses should be deemed
public  and what private  i have charged any article to the public 
which should be defrayed by me  their banker has my order  as soon as
the pleasure of congress shall be made known to him  to rectify the
error  by transferring the amount to my private account  and
discharging by so much that of the public 

  i have the honor to be   c

i was not apprized  until within a few hours  of the arrangements
which you have made for your departure  had i been informed of it
sooner  i should have proposed to the king to order a frigate to
convey you to your own country  in a manner suitable to the known
importance of the services you have been engaged in  to the esteem you
have acquired in france  and the particular esteem which his majesty
entertains for you

most entire consideration  with which i have the honor to be  sir

  sir 

i have the honor to acquaint you  that i left paris the 12th of july 
and  agreeable to the permission of congress  am returned to my own
country  mr jefferson had recovered his health  and was much esteemed
and respected there  our joint letters have already informed you of
our late proceedings  to which i have nothing to add  except that the
last act i did  as minister plenipotentiary for making treaties  was
to sign with him  two days before i came away  the treaty of
friendship and commerce that had been agreed on with prussia  31  and
which was to be carried to the hague  by mr short  there to be signed
by baron thulemeyer on the part of the king  who  without the least
hesitation  had approved and conceded to the new humane articles
proposed by congress  mr short was also to call at london for the
signature of mr adams  who i learnt  when at southampton  was well
received at the british court 

the captain lamb  who  in a letter of yours to mr adams  was said to
be coming to us with instructions respecting morocco  had not
appeared  nor had we heard anything of him  so nothing had been done
by us in that treaty 

i left the court of france in the same friendly disposition towards
the united states  that we have all along experienced  though
concerned to find that our credit is not better supported in the
payment of the interest money due on our loans  which  in case of
another war  must be  they think  extremely prejudicial to us  and
indeed may contribute to draw on a war the sooner  by affording our
enemies the encouraging confidence  that those who take so little care
to pay  will not again find it easy to borrow  i received from the
king  at my departure  the present of his picture set round with
diamonds  usually given to ministers plenipotentiary  who have signed
any treaties with that court  and it is at the disposition of
congress  to whom be pleased to present my dutiful respects 

  i am  with great esteem and regard   c

  sir 

i send you enclosed some letters  that have passed between the
secretary of congress and me  respecting three millions of livres 
acknowledged to have been received  before the treaty of february 
1778  as _don gratuit_ from the king  of which only two millions are
found in your accounts  unless the million from the farmers general be
one of the three  i have been assured  that all the money received
from the king  whether as loan or gift  went through your hands  and
as i always looked on the million we had of the farmers general to be
distinct from what we had of the crown  i wonder how i came to sign
the contract  acknowledging three millions of gift  when  in reality 
there was only two  exclusive of that from the farmers  and  as both
you and i examined the project of the contract before i signed it  i
am surprised  that neither of us took notice of the error 

it is possible  that the million furnished ostensibly by the farmers 
was in fact a gift of the crown  in which case  as mr thompson
observes  they owe us for the two ship loads of tobacco  which they
received on account of it  i must earnestly request of you to get this
matter explained  that it may stand clear before i die  lest some
enemy should afterwards accuse me of having received a million not
accounted for 

  i am   c

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write on the
28th of this month  touching the advance of a million  which you say
was made by the farmers general to the united states of america  the
3d of june  1777  i have no knowledge of that advance  what i have
verified is  that the king  by the contract of the 25th of february 
1783  has confirmed the gratuitous gift  which his majesty had
previously made  of the three millions hereafter mentioned  viz  one
million delivered by the royal treasury  the 10th of june  1776  and
two other millions advanced also by the royal treasury  in 1777  on
four receipts of the deputies of congress  of the 17th of january  3d
of april  10th of june  and 15th of october  of the same year  this
explanation will  sir  i hope  resolve your doubt  touching the
advance of the 3d of june  1777  i further recommend to you  sir  to
confer on this subject with m  gojard  who ought to be better informed
than we  who had no knowledge of any advances  but those made by the
royal treasury

i laid before the count de vergennes the two letters  which you did me
the honor to write  touching the three millions  the free gift of
which the king has confirmed in favor of the united states of america 
the minister  sir  observed that this gift has nothing to do with the
million  which the congress may have received from the farmers general
in 1777  consequently he thinks  that the receipt  which you desire
may be communicated to you  cannot satisfy the object of your view 
and that it would be useless to give you the copy which you desire

  my dear sir 

the letter you honored me with  covered the copies of three letters 
which mr thompson wrote you to obtain an explanation of a million 
which is not to be found in my accounts  i should have been very much
embarrassed in satisfying and proving to him  that i had not put that
million in my pocket  had i not applied to m  durival  who  as you
will see by the answer enclosed  informs me  that there was a million
paid by the royal treasury  on the 10th of june  1776  this is the
very million about which mr thompson inquires  as i have kept an
account of the other two millions  which were also furnished by the
royal treasury  viz  the one million in january and april  1777  the
other in july and october of the same year  as well as that furnished
by the farmers general in june  1777 

here then are the three millions exactly  which were given by the king
before the treaty of 1778  and that furnished by the farmers general 
nothing then remains to be known  but who received the first million
in june  1776  it could not be myself  as i was not charged with the
business of congress until january  1777  i therefore requested of m 
durival a copy of the receipt for the one million  you have the
answer  which he returned to me  i wrote to him again  renewing my
request  but as the courier is just setting off  i cannot wait to give
you his answer  but you will receive it in my next  if i obtain one 

in the meanwhile  i beg you will receive the assurances of the
sentiments of respect  with which i have the honor to be  my dear sir

  sir 

i have laid before the count de vergennes  as you seemed to desire 
the letter which you did me the honor to write yesterday  the minister
persists in the opinion  that the receipt  the copy of which you
request  has no relation to the business with which you were intrusted
on behalf of congress  and that this piece would be useless in the new
point of view in which you have placed it  indeed  sir  it is easy
for you to prove  that the money in question was not delivered by the
royal treasury into your hands  as you did not begin to be charged
with the business of congress until january  1777  and the receipt for
that money is of the 10th of june  1776

i hazard a letter in hopes it may be able to join that of the 9th at
l orient  in order to forward to you the answer i have just received
from m  durival  you will there see  that notwithstanding my entreaty 
the minister himself refuses to give me a copy of the receipt which i
asked for  i cannot conceive the reason for this reserve  more
especially since  if there has been a million paid  he who has
received it has kept the account  and it must in time be known  i
shall hear with pleasure  that you have been more fortunate in this
respect in america than i have been in france  and i repeat to you the
assurance of the sentiments of regard  with which i have the honor to
be   c

                                     philadelphia  january 27th  1787 

  dear friend 

you may remember  that in the correspondence between us in june last 
on the subject of a million _free gift_ of the king of france 
acknowledged in our contract to have been received  but which did not
appear to be accounted for in our banker s accounts  unless it should
be the same with the million said to be received from the
farmers general  i mentioned  that an explanation might doubtless be
easily obtained by writing to mr grand  or mr jefferson  i know not
whether you have accordingly written to either of them  but being
desirous that the matter should speedily be cleared up  i wrote myself
to mr grand a letter upon it  of which i now enclose a copy  with his
answers  and several letters from m  durival  32  who is _chef du
bureau des fonds_  and has under his care the finance  _des affaires
etrangeres_ 

you will see by these letters  that the million in question was
delivered to somebody  on the 10th of june  1776  but it does not
appear to whom  it is clear  however  that it could not be to mr
grand  nor to the commissioners from congress  for we did not meet in
france till the end of december  1776  or beginning of january  1777 
and that banker was not charged before with our affairs 

by the minister s reserve in refusing him a copy of the receipt  i
conjecture it must be money advanced for our use  to m  de
beaumarchais  and that it is a _mystère du cabinet_  which perhaps
should not be further inquired into  unless necessary to guard against
more demands than may be just from that agent  for it may well be
supposed  that if the court furnished him with the means of supplying
us  they may not be willing to furnish authentic proofs of such a
transaction  so early in our dispute with britain  pray tell me  has
he dropped his demands  or does he still continue to worry you with
them 

i should like to have these original letters returned to me  but you
may if you please keep copies of them  it is true the million in
question makes no difference in your accounts with the king of france 
it not being mentioned or charged  as so much lent and to be repaid 
but stated as freely given  yet  if it was put into the hands of any
of your agents  or ministers  they ought certainly to account for it 
i do not recollect whether mr deane had arrived in france before the
10th of june  1776  33  but from his great want of money  when i
joined him a few months after  i hardly think it could have been paid
to him  possibly mr jefferson may obtain the information  though mr
grand could not  and i wish he may be directed to make the inquiry  as
i know he would do it directly  i mean if  by hortalez and co s
further demands  or for any other reason  such an inquiry should be

                     to the president of congress 

                                    philadelphia  november 29th  1788 

  sir 

when i had the honor of being the minister of the united states at the
court of france  mr barclay arriving there  brought me the following
resolution of congress 

 resolved  that a commissioner be appointed by congress  with full
power and authority to liquidate  and _finally to settle_  the
accounts of all the servants of the united states  who have been
intrusted with the expenditure of public money in europe  and to
commence and prosecute such suits  causes  and actions  as may be
necessary for that purpose  or for the recovery of any property of the
said united states in the hands of any person  or persons  whatsoever 

 that the said commissioner be authorised to appoint one or more
clerks  with such allowance as he may think reasonable 

 that the said commissioner and clerks  respectively  take an oath
before some person duly authorised to administer an oath  faithfully
to execute the trust reposed in them respectively 

 congress proceeded to the election of a commissioner  and ballots
being taken  mr t  barclay was elected  

in pursuance of this resolution  and as soon as mr barclay was at
leisure from more pressing business  i rendered to him all my
accounts  which he examined  and stated methodically  by his statement
he found a balance due me on the 4th of may  1785  of 7 533 livres  19
sols  3 den  which i accordingly received of the congress banker  the
difference between my statement and his being only seven sols  which
by mistake i had overcharged  about three pence halfpenny sterling 

at my request  however  the accounts were left open for the
consideration of congress  and not finally settled  there being some
articles on which i desired their judgment  and having some equitable
demands  as i thought them  for extra services  which he had not
conceived himself empowered to allow  and therefore i did not put them
in my account  he transmitted the accounts to congress  and had advice
of their being received  on my arrival at philadelphia  one of the
first things i did was to despatch my grandson  william t  franklin 
to new york  to obtain a final settlement of those accounts  he having
long acted as my secretary  and being well acquainted with the
transactions  was able to give an explanation of the articles  that
might seem to require explaining  if any such there were  he returned
without effecting the settlement  being told that it could not be made
till the arrival of some documents expected from france  what those
documents were  i have not been informed  nor can i readily conceive 
as all the vouchers existing there had been examined by mr barclay 
and i  having been immediately after my arrival engaged in the public
business of this state  waited in expectation of hearing from
congress  in case any part of my accounts had been objected to 

it is now more than three years that those accounts have been before
that honorable body  and  to this day  no notice of any such objection
has been communicated to me  but reports have  for some time past 
been circulated here  and propagated in the newspapers  that i am
greatly indebted to the united states for large sums  that had been
put into my hands  and that i avoid a settlement  this  together with
the little time one of my age may expect to live  makes it necessary
for me to request earnestly  which i hereby do  that the congress
would be pleased  without further delay  to examine those accounts 
and if they find therein any article or articles  which they do not
understand or approve  that they would cause me to be acquainted with
the same  that i may have an opportunity of offering such explanations
or reasons in support of them as may be in my power  and then that the
accounts may be finally closed 

i hope the congress will soon be able to attend to this business for
the satisfaction of the public  as well as in condescension to my
request  in the meantime  if there be no impropriety in it  i would
desire that this letter  together with another 35  relating to the
same subject  the copy of which is hereto annexed  may be put upon
their minutes 

with every sentiment of respect and duty to congress  i am  sir   c 

                                                          b  franklin

  the

  correspondence

  of

  john adams 


  one of the commissioners to france  minister
  plenipotentiary to holland  and one of the
  commissioners for negotiating the
  treaty of peace 




john adams was a delegate in the first continental congress  and one
of the most active  zealous  and efficient members of that body  for
three years his labors in congress were incessant  and of the most
valuable kind  it is said of him  that he belonged to more committees
than any other individual  and he discharged the duties of each with
remarkable promptness and energy 

the foreign affairs of the united states having assumed an important
aspect  mr adams was appointed a commissioner to france in the place
of silas deane  who had been recalled  this appointment took place on
the 28th of november  1777  and in the following february he embarked
from boston  after a long and disagreeable passage of fortyfive days
he arrived in france  here he devoted himself to the duties of his
mission  in conjunction with his colleagues  till dr franklin was
appointed minister plenipotentiary to the court of france  and the
commission was dissolved  having no longer any charge to execute in
europe  mr adams left paris on the 8th of march  1779  for nantes 
where he proposed to embark for his own country  various accidents and
unexpected causes of delay kept him there till the 14th of june  when
he sailed in the french frigate  the sensible  in company with m  de
la luzerne  who was coming to the united states in the character of
minister plenipotentiary  as successor to m  gerard  the french
government had voluntarily proffered to mr adams a passage in this
vessel  after his disappointment in not sailing in the american
frigate alliance  as he at first expected  the sensible arrived in
boston on the 3d of august 

but he was not long allowed to remain a spectator only of public
events  on the 27th of september he was again chosen by congress to
represent his country abroad  as minister plenipotentiary for
negotiating a treaty of peace and a treaty of commerce with great
britain  when that nation should be found in a humor to recognise the
independence of the united states  and enter into bonds of friendship 
a task more honorable  momentous  and difficult could not have awaited
him  nor one bearing more emphatical testimony of the confidence of
his countrymen in his wisdom  abilities  integrity  and patriotism  on
this second mission he sailed in the same frigate  which had brought
him from france  accommodations for this purpose having been offered
to congress by the french minister in philadelphia  the vessel sprang
a leak on the passage  and the captain was obliged to put into ferrol 
in spain  where he arrived on the 8th of december  from this place 
that he might avoid further hazards and uncertainty of a sea voyage in
the depth of winter  mr adams resolved to proceed by land to the point
of his destination  he reached paris on the 9th of february  1780  the
extreme badness of the travelling at this season had detained him
nearly two months on the road 

by the terms of his commission  the place of his residence was not
prescribed  but for the present he chose to fix himself in paris  as
amicable relations already subsisted between the french court and
congress  and he was instructed to consult the french ministry in
regard to any movements  that might be made in effecting a treaty with
england  he held a correspondence with count de vergennes  respecting
the time and manner of carrying his instructions into execution  and
on other topics  in all of which  however  his opinions and those of
the french minister were somewhat at variance  there seeming no
prospect that great britain would soon be inclined to peace  and mr
adams having no special reasons for remaining at the french court  he
made a tour to holland in the beginning of august  leaving his
secretary  mr dana  in paris 

meantime congress had assigned to him another duty  mr henry laurens
had been appointed  as early as november  1779  to negotiate a loan of
ten millions abroad  but having been prevented by various causes from
departing on this service  congress  on the 20th of june following 
authorised mr adams to engage in the undertaking  and prosecute it
till mr laurens  or some other person in his stead  should arrive in
europe  this commission reached paris four weeks after he had left
that city  and mr dana proceeded with it to holland  efforts were
immediately made to procure a loan in that country  which were for a
long time ineffectual  but which at last succeeded 

mr laurens sailed for holland in august  1780  but was captured a few
days afterwards by a british frigate  which conveyed him to
newfoundland  whence he was sent to england and imprisoned in the
tower  when this intelligence reached congress  it was resolved to
transfer his appointment to another person  and on the 29th of
december mr adams was commissioned to negotiate a treaty of amity and
commerce with the united provinces  and he was furnished with separate
letters of credence as minister plenipotentiary to the states general
and to the prince of orange  the state of parties in holland  and
particularly the influence of england there  rendered unavailing all
advances of the american minister towards a treaty 

it having been intimated to mr adams  by the duc de la vauguyon 
french ambassador in holland  that a treaty of peace was in prospect
through the mediation of russia and austria  and that count de
vergennes would be glad to see him on the subject at versailles  he
set off for paris on the 6th of july  1781  he had several interviews
with the count de vergennes  and a correspondence of some length 
after remaining three weeks at paris and versailles  without
perceiving any apparent indications  that this project for a
negotiation would come to maturity  he returned again to holland 

on the 14th of june congress appointed four other commissioners  in
conjunction with mr adams  to negotiate a treaty of peace  namely 
benjamin franklin  john jay  henry laurens  and thomas jefferson  and
the first commission of mr adams for this purpose was annulled 

a misunderstanding having grown up between england and the united
provinces  chiefly on account of the part taken by the latter in
joining the northern powers to carry into operation the plan of the
armed neutrality  the french court thought it a good opportunity for
the united states to seek a treaty of alliance with holland  this step
was accordingly recommended to congress through the french minister at
philadelphia  and  in consequence of this suggestion  new powers were
conferred on mr adams  dated august the 16th  by which he was
commissioned to negotiate a treaty of alliance with holland  limited
in duration to the continuance of the war with england  and
conformable to the treaties then subsisting with france 

the political relations between the several provinces of holland were
such  however  that the process of negotiation went on heavily and
slowly  the english interest still continued strong  even after the
war had begun  and embarrassments of various kinds were thrown in the
way  which required no common share of sagacity  firmness  and
perseverance to overcome  all these at length yielded  and on the 8th
of october  1782  a treaty of commerce between the united states and
holland  and a convention concerning recaptures  were signed at the
hague 

dr franklin and mr jay had now been for three or four months actively
engaged in the negotiation of peace at paris  having thus brought
affairs to a happy issue in holland  mr adams hastened to join the
commissioners  and arrived in paris before the end of october  from
that time till the preliminary articles were signed  november the
30th  he applied himself unremittingly with his colleagues to the
details of the negotiation  he also took part in the discussions
respecting the definitive treaty  which followed from time to time 
and was one of the signers of that instrument 

in the winter of 1784 he was in holland  in january  1785  he was
appointed the first american minister plenipotentiary to the court of
st james s  while in england  he wrote his defence of the american
constitutions  in the year 1788 permission was granted him to return
home  where he arrived after an absence of almost nine years  during
the whole of which period he had been employed in services of the
highest responsibility and importance  he was shortly afterwards
elected vice president of the united states  under the first
presidency of washington

  dear sir 

with great pleasure to ourselves we discharge our duty  by enclosing
to you your commission for representing these united states at the
court of france  we are by no means willing to admit a thought of your
declining this important service  and therefore we send duplicates of
the commission  and the late resolves  in order that you may take one
set with you  and send the other by another vessel 

these are important papers  and therefore we wish they may be put into
the hands of a particular and careful person  with directions to
deliver them himself into the hands of the commissioners  mr hancock 
before he left this place  said that he intended to send a gentleman
to france on some particular business  cannot we prevail to get this
gentleman to undertake the delivery of our packet to the
commissioners  they paying the expense of travel to paris  and back
again to his place of business 

it is unnecessary to mention the propriety of directing these
despatches to be bagged with weight proper for sinking them  on any
immediate prospect of their otherwise falling into the enemy s hands 

we sincerely wish you a quick and pleasant voyage  being truly your
affectionate friends

  sir 

having been absent on a journey  i had not the honor of receiving your
letters until yesterday  when one  of the 28th of november  enclosing
a resolution of congress of the same day  and another of the 3d of
december  enclosing a commission for dr franklin  dr lee  and myself 
to represent the united states at the court of france  were delivered
to me in boston 

as i am deeply penetrated with a sense of the high honor  which has
been done me in this appointment  i cannot but wish i were better
qualified for the important trust  but as congress are perfectly
acquainted with all my deficiencies  i conclude it is their
determination to make the necessary allowances  in the humble hope of
which  i shall submit my own judgment to theirs  and devote all the
faculties i have  and all that i can acquire  to their service 

you will be pleased to accept of my sincere thanks  for the polite
manner in which you have communicated to me the commands of congress 
and believe me to be  with the most perfect respect and esteem   c

                                                passy  may 21st  1778 

  dear sir 

i have never yet paid my respects to you since my arrival in europe 
for which seeming neglect of duty  the total novelty of the scenes
about me  and the incessant avocations of business  and ceremony  and
pleasure   for this last  i find in europe  makes an essential part of
both the other two   must plead my excuse 

the situation of the general affairs of europe is still critical and
of dubious tendency  it is still uncertain whether there will be war
between the turks and the russians  between the emperor and the king
of prussia  and indeed between england and france  in the opinion of
many people  my own conjecture  however  is that a war will commence 
and that soon 

before this reaches you  you will be informed that a strong squadron
of thirteen capital ships and several frigates has sailed from toulon 
and that another squadron is ordered to sail from spithead  whatever i
may have heard of the destination of the first  i am not at liberty to
mention it  we have no intelligence that the latter has sailed 

chatham the great is no more  but there is so much of his wild spirit
in his last speech yet left in the nation  that i have no doubt but
the administration will put all to the hazard 

we are happy to hear by the frigate  la sensible  which has returned
to brest  that the treaty arrived safe at casco bay  we hope to have
the earliest intelligence of the ratification of it  the commissioners
from england  of the 22d of april  will meet  as we suppose  with
nothing but ridicule  the king of prussia is yet upon the reserve
concerning america  or rather forgetting his promise  has determined
not to acknowledge our independence at present  his reason is obvious 
he wants the aid of those very german princes  who are most
subservient to great britain  who have furnished her with troops to
carry on the war against us  and  therefore  he does not choose to
offend them by an alliance with us at present  spain is on the reserve
too  but there is not the least doubt entertained here of her
intention to support america  in holland there is more friendship for
us than i was aware of before i came here  at least  they will take no
part against us 

our affairs in this kingdom i find in a state of confusion and
darkness  that surprises me  prodigious sums of money have been
expended  and large sums are yet due  but there are no books of
account  nor any documents from whence i have been able to learn what
the united states have received as an equivalent 

there is one subject which lies heavily on my mind  and that is the
expense of the commissioners  you have three commissioners at this
court  each of whom lives at an expense of at least three thousand
pounds sterling a year  i fear at a greater expense  few men in the
world are capable of living at a less expense than i am  but i find
the other gentlemen have expended from three to four thousand a year
each  and one of them from five to six  and by all the inquiries i
have been able to make  i cannot find any article of expense which can
be retrenched  36 

the truth is  in my humble opinion  our system is wrong in many
particulars 

1  in having three commissioners at this court  one in the character
of envoy is enough  at present  each of the three is considered in the
character of a public minister plenipotentiary  which lays him under
an absolute necessity of living up to this character  whereas  one
alone would be obliged to incur no greater expense  and would be quite
sufficient for all the business of a public minister 

2  in leaving the salaries of these ministers at an uncertainty  you
will never be able to obtain a satisfactory account of the public
monies while this system continues  it is a temptation to live at too
great an expense  and gentlemen will feel an aversion to demanding a
vigorous account 

3  in blending the business of a public minister with that of a
commercial agent  the business of various departments is by this means
so blended  and the public and private expenses so confounded with
each other  that i am sure no satisfaction can ever be given to the
public of the disposition of their interests  and i am very confident 
that jealousies and suspicions will hereafter arise against the
characters of gentlemen  who may  perhaps  have acted with perfect
integrity and the fairest intentions for the public good 

my idea is this  separate the offices of public ministers from those
of commercial agents  37  recall  or send to some other court  all
the public ministers but one at this court  determine with precision
the sum that shall be allowed to the remaining one for his expenses 
for his salary  and for his time  risk  trouble   c   and when this is
done  see that he receives no more than his allowance  the
inconveniences arising from the multiplicity of ministers and the
complication of business are infinite 

remember me with the most tender affection to my worthy colleagues 
and to all others to whom you know they are due 

  i am your friend and servant 

                                                           john adams 

footnotes 

   36  in another letter  which mr adams afterwards wrote to mr samuel
  adams  he says the account of the commissioners  expenses here given
  is  exaggerated   and  put much too high   owing to his having been
  but a short time in paris  and not being accurately informed on the
  subject  see this letter hereafter  dated february 14th  1779  in the
  present volume 

  by a letter from mr arthur lee  dated may 9th  1778  containing a
  transcript from the banker s books  it appears  that from december 
  1776  to march  1778  a period of fifteen months  silas deane received
  on his private account   20 926  arthur lee   12 749  and dr franklin 
   12 214  _see arthur lee s correspondence_  vol  ii  p  159  where the
  above sums are stated in livres  and they are here reduced to dollars
  by the rule practised at that time  of allowing five livres and eight
  sols to the dollar  the fractions are omitted in the reduction  it
  must be observed  that the above payments are not a specification of
  the amounts actually received for the period in question  because the
  commissioners may have had other expenses for which they afterwards
  drew on the banker  but these sums may serve as a tolerably correct
  indication of their expenses  and were probably intended as such by mr
  lee  at this time no fixed salary was allowed  but congress resolved
  that all expenses should be paid  and that such an additional
  compensation should be granted  as might afterwards be deemed
  expedient by congress 

  on the 1st of june  1778  mr lee wrote to congress   i am of opinion 
  with our colleague  mr adams  that it would be better for the public 
  that the appointment of your public ministers were fixed  instead of
  being left at large  and their expenses indefinite  from experience  i
  find the expense of living in that character cannot well be less than
  three thousand pounds sterling a year    13 333  which i believe is as
  little as is allowed to any public minister beyond the rank of
  consul   _arthur lee s correspondence_  vol  ii  p  165 

  the original mode of paying ministers abroad continued  however  till
  october 4th  1779  when congress 

  _resolved_  that each of the ministers plenipotentiary  be allowed at
  the rate of two thousand five hundred pounds sterling   11 111  per
  annum  and each of their secretaries at the rate of one thousand
  pounds sterling   4 444  per annum  in full for their services and
  expenses respectively 

   that the salary of each of the said officers be computed from the
  time of leaving his place of abode to enter on the duties of his
  office  and be continued three months after notice of his recall  
  _secret journals_  vol  ii  p  272 

  the salaries continued fixed at the above sums during the remainder of
  the revolution  and till may 7th  1784  when the salary of ministers
  was reduced to  9000  and that of secretaries to  3000 per annum 

   37  dr franklin expresses this opinion very strongly on several
  occasions  and after he was appointed minister plenipotentiary  with
  the duties of commercial agent attached to his office  he repeatedly
  solicited congress to separate these duties  and to leave him in
  charge only of those branches of business  which pertained to him in
  the character of minister  see _franklin s correspondence_  vol  iii

                                                passy  may 24th  1778 

  gentlemen 

i find that the american affairs on this side of the atlantic are in a
state of disorder  very much resembling that which is so much to be
regretted on the other  and arising  as i suppose  from the same
general causes  the novelty of the scenes  the inexperience of the
actors  and the rapidity with which great events have succeeded each
other  our resources are very inadequate to the demands made upon us 
which are perhaps unnecessarily increased by several irregularities of
proceeding 

we have in some places two or three persons  who claim the character
of american agents  agent for commercial affairs  and continental
agent  for they are called by all these different appellations  in one
quarter  one gentleman claims the character from the appointment of
mr william lee  another claims it from the appointment of the
commissioners at passy  and a third from the appointment of the
commercial committee of congress  this introduces a triple expense 
and much confusion and delay  these evils have been accidental  i
believe  and unavoidable  but they are evils still  and ought to be
removed 

one person at bordeaux  another at nantes  and a third perhaps at
havre de grace  or dunkirk  would be amply sufficient for all public
purposes  and to these persons all orders from congress  or the
commercial committee  or the commissioners at paris  ought to be
addressed  to the same persons all public ships of war  and all other
ships belonging to the united states  and their prizes  ought to be
addressed  and all orders for the supplies of provisions  clothing 
repairs of vessels   c  as well as all orders for shipping of
merchandises  or warlike stores for the united states  ought to go
through their hands  we have such abuses and irregularities every day
occurring  as are very alarming  agents of various sorts are drawing
bills upon us  and the commanders of vessels of war are drawing upon
us for expenses and supplies  which we never ordered  so that our
resources will soon fail  if a speedy stop is not put to this career 

and we find it so difficult to obtain accounts from agents of the
expenditure of monies  and of the goods and merchandises shipped by
them  that we can never know the true state of our finances  or when
and in what degree we have executed the orders of congress for sending
them arms  clothes  medicines  or other things 

in order to correct some of the abuses  and to bring our affairs into
a little better order  i have constantly given my voice against
paying for things we never ordered  against paying persons who have
never been authorised  and against throwing our affairs into a
multiplicity of hands in the same place  but the consequence has been
so many refusals of demands and requests  that i expect much
discontent will arise from it  and many clamors  whether the
appointment by congress of one or more consuls for this kingdom would
remedy these inconveniences  i must submit to their wisdom 

  i have the honor to be   c

  my dear friend 

i had yesterday the honor of receiving the despatches from congress 
which were sent by the saratoga from baltimore  arrived at nantes 
convoyed in by the boston  captain tucker   who was returning from a
short cruise  and who has sent in four prizes   and those by the spy 
from new london  arrived at brest  and the inexpressible pleasure of
your private letters by the same vessels  you acquaint me  that you
had written to me eight or nine times  which has given me some
anxiety  as these letters are the first i have received from you or
from any member of congress  since my arrival in france 

the ratification of the treaty gives universal joy to this court and
nation  who seem to be sincerely and deeply rejoiced at this connexion
between the two countries 

there is no declaration of war as yet at london or versailles  but the
ships of the two nations are often fighting at sea  and there is not
the smallest doubt but war will be declared  unless britain should
miraculously have wisdom given her to make a treaty with the congress
like that which france has made  spain has not made a treaty  but be
not deceived nor intimidated  all is safe in that quarter 

the unforeseen dispute in bavaria has made the empress queen and king
of prussia cautious of quarrelling with great britain  because her
connexion with a number of the german princes  whose aid each of those
potentates is soliciting  makes her friendship  or at least her
neutrality in the german war  of importance to each  but this will do
no hurt to america 

you have drawn so many bills of exchange upon us  and sent us so many
frigates  every one of which costs us a large sum of money  so many
merchandises and munitions of war have been sent  whether arrived or
not  and we expect so many more drafts upon us  that i assure you i am
very uneasy concerning our finances here  we are laboring to hire
money  and have some prospect of success  but i am afraid not for such
sums as will be wanted 

let me entreat you to omit no opportunity of writing me  send me all
the newspapers  journals   c  and believe me your friend and servant

  my dear friend 

your favors of may 16th and 25th  by captain barnes reached me
yesterday  these  with those by niles from connecticut  and those by
the saratoga from baltimore  are all that i have received from you  or
from anybody at congress  which gives me pain  because your other
letters must have miscarried  and i hold your letters in so high
esteem  that i cannot be willing to lose one 

the robbery of folger s packet  by all that i can learn  must have
been committed by a traitor  who made his escape to england  but dr
franklin and mr lee  who were acquainted with this transaction  will 
i suppose  develope the mystery as far as they are able  one of these
gentlemen has some other suspicions  but i believe the fugitive to
england was the only thief 

mr deane  whom you mention  is no doubt with you before now  but if
the count d estaing has not been able to strike a decisive blow before
the arrival of byron  i should fear that some misfortune has befallen
him since the junction of byron and howe  we are  however  anxious to
know the naval manoeuvres in america  as well as those of the armies 
mr deane complains of ill treatment  and claims great merit for his
services  i shall not add to the ill treatment  nor depreciate the
merit  but it will never do for congress to dread the resentment of
their servants  i have heard a great deal in this country concerning
his conduct  great panegyrics and harsh censures  but i believe he has
neither the extravagant merit that some persons ascribe to him  nor
the gross faults to answer for  which some others impute or suspect  i
believe he was a diligent servant of the public  and rendered it
useful service  his living was expensive  but whether he made the vast
profit to himself that some persons suspect  i know not  or whether
any profit at all  one thing i know  that my family will feel that i
shall not imitate him in this faculty  if it really was his  for which
reason i wish congress would determine  what allowance we shall have
for our time  that i might know whether my family can live upon it or
not 

extravagant claims to merit are always to be suspected  general gates
was the ablest negotiator you ever had in europe  38  and next to him 
general washington s attack upon the enemy at germantown  i do not
know  indeed  whether this last affair had not more influence upon the
european mind than that of saratoga  although the attempt was
unsuccessful  the military gentlemen in europe considered it as the
most decisive proof that america would finally succeed 

and you may depend upon it  although your agents in europe were to
plead with the tongues of men and angels  although they had the
talents and the experience of mazarin  or the integrity of d asset 
your army in america will have more success than they 

i foresee there will be diversities of sentiment concerning this
gentleman   deane   and perhaps warm debates  perhaps there will be as
much as there has been about a general in the northern department  all
that i request is  that i may not be drawn into the dispute  europe
has not charms enough for me to wish to stay here to the exclusion of
abler negotiators  much less at the expense of heat and divisions in
congress  how well united you were in the choice of me i never was
informed  and how soon attempts may be made to displace me i know not 
but one thing i beg of my friends  and one only  that if any attempt
of that kind should be made  they would give me up  rather than
continue my residence at the expense of debates in congress  and by
the favor of small majorities 

if i were capable of speculating in english funds  or of conducting
private trade  i might find opportunities here to make a private
profit  and might have inducements from private considerations to
continue here  but this will never be my case  and i am very well
persuaded that congress will never grant me so much for my services
here  as i could earn by my profession in boston  to which i will
return with submission to old ocean  old boreas  and british men of
war  the moment i am released from this station  i wish however that
congress would determine what allowance they will grant  that honest
men may not be made or suspected otherwise  as to the public  i am
fully persuaded that its interests are not at all concerned in my
residence here  as there is a great plenty of persons quite as well
qualified 

  i am   c

  sir 

i thank you for your kind congratulations on the favorable appearances
in our american concerns  and for so politely particularizing one of
the most inconsiderable of them  my safe arrival in france  which was
after a very inconvenient passage of fortyfive days 

your letter to mr izard i had the pleasure to send to him immediately
in paris  where he resides  the court of tuscany being so connected
with that of vienna  as to discourage hitherto his departure for
italy  he did me the honor of a visit yesterday  when we had much
conversation upon american affairs 

your other letter to your daughter in law  i have forwarded by a safe
opportunity  you may depend upon my conveying your letters to any of
your friends by the best opportunities  and with despatch  the more of
your commands you send me  the more pleasure you will give me 

war is not declared  that is  no manifesto has been published  but
each nation is daily manufacturing materials for the other s
manifesto  by open hostilities  in short  sir  the two nations have
been at war ever since the recall of the ambassadors  the king of
france has given orders to all his ships to attack the english  and
has given vast encouragement to privateers 

the king of great britain and his council have determined to send
instructions to their commissioners in america to offer us
independency  provided we will make peace with them  separate from
france  this appears to me to be the last effort to seduce  deceive 
and divide  they know that every man of honor in america must receive
this proposition with indignation  but they think they can get the men
of no honor to join them by such a proposal  and they think the men of
honor are not a majority  what has america done to give occasion to
that king and council to think so unworthily of her 

the proposition is in other words this   america  you have fought me
until i despair of beating you  you have made an alliance with the
first power of europe  which is a great honor to your country and a
great stability to your cause  so great that it has excited my highest
resentment  and has determined me to go to war with france  do you
break your faith with that power and forfeit her confidence  as well
as that of all the rest of mankind forever  and join me to beat her 
or stand by neuter and see me do it  and for all this i will
acknowledge your independency  because i think in that case you cannot
maintain it  but will be an easy prey to me afterwards  who am
determined to break my faith with you  as i wish you to do yours with
france  

my dear countrymen  i hope you will not be allured upon the rocks  by
the syren song of peace  they are now playing a sure game  they have
run all hazards  but now they hazard nothing 

i know your application is incessant and your moments precious  and 
therefore  that i ask a great favor in requesting your correspondence 
but the interests of the public  as well as private friendship  induce
me to do it 

  i am   c

  my dear sir 

the sovereign of britain and his council have determined to instruct
their commissioners to offer you independence  provided you will
disconnect yourselves from france 

the question arises  how came the king and council by authority to
offer this  it is certain that they have it not 

in the next place  is the treaty of alliance between us and france now
binding upon us  i think there is not room to doubt it  for
declarations and manifestos do not make the state of war  they are
only publications of the reasons of war  yet the message of the king
of great britain to both houses of parliament  and their answers to
that message were as full a declaration of war as ever was made  and
accordingly hostilities have been frequent ever since  this proposal 
then  is a modest invitation to a gross act of infidelity and breach
of faith  it is an observation that i have often heard you make  that
 france is the natural ally of the united states   this observation
is  in my opinion  both just and important  the reasons are plain  as
long as great britain shall have canada  nova scotia  and the
floridas  or any of them  so long will great britain be the enemy of
the united states  let her disguise it as much as she will 

it is not much to the honor of human nature  but the fact is certain 
that neighboring nations are never friends in reality  in the times of
the most perfect peace between them  their hearts and their passions
are hostile  and this will certainly be the case forever between the
thirteen united states and the english colonies  france and england 
as neighbors and rivals  never have been and never will be friends 
the hatred and jealousy between the nations are eternal and
irradicable  as we  therefore  on the one hand  have the surest ground
to expect the jealousy and hatred of great britain  so on the other we
have the strongest reasons to depend upon the friendship and alliance
of france  and no one reason in the world to expect her enmity or her
jealousy  as she has given up every pretension to any spot of ground
on the continent  the united states  therefore  will be for ages the
natural bulwark of france against the hostile designs of england
against her  and france is the natural defence of the united states
against the rapacious spirit of great britain against them  france is
a nation so vastly eminent  having been for so many centuries what
they call the dominant power of europe  being incomparably the most
powerful at land  that united in a close alliance with our states  and
enjoying the benefit of our trade  there is not the smallest reason to
doubt  but both will be a sufficient curb upon the naval power of
great britain 

this connexion  therefore  will forever secure a respect for our
states in spain  portugal  and holland too  who will always choose to
be upon friendly terms with powers  who have numerous cruisers at sea 
and indeed in all the rest  of europe  i presume  therefore  that
sound policy as well as good faith will induce us never to renounce
our alliance with france  even although it should continue us for some
time in war  the french are as sensible of the benefits of this
alliance to them as we are  and they are determined as much as we to
cultivate it 

in order to continue the war  or at least that we may do any good in
the common cause  the credit of our currency must be supported  but
how  taxes  my dear sir  taxes  pray let our countrymen consider and
be wise  every farthing they pay in taxes is a farthing s worth of
wealth and good policy  if it were possible to hire money in europe to
discharge the bills  it would be a dreadful drain to the country to
pay the interest of it  but i fear it will not be  the house of
austria has sent orders to amsterdam to hire a very great sum  england
is borrowing great sums  and france is borrowing largely  amidst such
demands for money  and by powers who offer better terms  i fear we
shall not be able to succeed 

pray write me as often as you can  and believe me your friend and
servant

  my dear sir 

your kind favor of july the 1st was brought here yesterday from
bordeaux  where captain ayres has arrived  but was not delivered to me
till this day  this is the second only received from you  i have
infinite satisfaction in learning from all parts of america the
prosperous train of our affairs  and the unanimity and spirit of the
people  every vessel brings us fresh accessions of ardor to the
french  and of depression to the english  in the war that is now begun
in earnest 

the resolutions of congress upon the conciliatory bills  the address
to the people  the ratification of the treaty  the answer to the
commissioners  the president s letter  the message of g  livingston 
and the letter of mr drayton  are read here with an avidity that would
surprise you  it is not one of the least misfortunes of great britain 
that she has to contend with so much eloquence  that there are such
painters to exhibit her atrocious actions to the world  and transmit
them to posterity  every publication of this kind seems to excite the
ardor of the french nation  and of their fleets and armies  as much as
if they were americans 

while american orators are thus employed in perpetuating the
remembrance of the injustice and cruelty of great britain towards us 
the french fleet has been giving such a check to her naval pride  as
she has not experienced before for many ages  the vessel  which is to
carry this  will carry information of a general engagement between
d orvilliers and keppel  which terminated in a disgraceful flight of
the english fleet  we hope soon to hear of d estaing s success  which
would demonstrate to the universe  that britain is no longer mistress
of the ocean  but the events of war are always uncertain  and a
misfortune may have happened to the french fleet in america  but even
if this should be the case  which i do not believe  still britain is
not mistress of the sea  and every day will bring fresh proofs that
she is not  the springs of her naval power are dried away 

i have hitherto had the happiness to find that my pulse beat in exact
unison with those of my countrymen  i have ventured with some freedom
to give my opinion  as to what congress would do with the conciliatory
bills  with the commissioners  with the treaty   c   c  and every
packet brings us proceedings of congress  according in substance  but
executed in a manner infinitely exceeding my abilities  nothing has
given me more joy  than the universal disdain that is expressed both
in public and private letters  at the idea of departing from the
treaty and violating the public faith  this faith is our american
glory  and it is our bulwark  it is the only foundation on which our
union can rest securely  it is the only support of our credit both in
finance and commerce  it is our sole security for the assistance of
foreign powers  if the british court with their arts could shake it 
or the confidence in it  we should be undone forever  they would
triumph over us  after all our toil and danger  they would subjugate
us more entirely than they ever intended  the idea of infidelity
cannot be treated with too much resentment or too much horror  the man
who can think of it with patience is a traitor in his heart  and ought
be execrated as one  who adds the deepest hypocrisy to the blackest
treason 

is there a sensible hypocrite in america  who can start a jealousy 
that religion may be in danger  from whence can this danger arise  not
from france  she claims no inch of ground upon your continent  she
claims no legislative authority over you  no negative upon your laws 
no right of appointing you bishops  nor of sending you missionaries 
besides  the spirit of crusading for religion is not in france  the
rage for making proselytes  which has existed in former centuries  is
no more  there is a spirit more liberal here in this respect  than i
expected to find  where has been the danger to the religion of the
protestant cantons of switzerland  from an alliance with france  which
has subsisted with entire harmony for one hundred and fifty years  or
thereabouts  but this subject is fitter for ridicule than serious
argument  as nothing can be clearer than that in this enlightened
tolerant age  at this vast distance  without a claim or color of
authority  with an express acknowledgment and warranty of sovereignty 
this  i had almost said tolerant nation  can never endanger our
religion 

the longer i live in europe  and the more i consider our affairs  the
more important our alliance with france appears to me  it is a rock
upon which we may safely build  narrow and illiberal prejudices 
peculiar to john bull  with which i might perhaps have been in some
degree infected when i was john bull  have now no influence over me  i
never was  however  much of john bull  i was john yankee  and such i
shall live and die  is great britain to be annihilated  no such thing 
a revolution in her government may possibly take place  but whether in
favor of despotism or republicanism  is the question  the scarcity of
virtue  and even the semblance of it  seems an invincible obstacle to
the latter  but the annihilation of a nation never takes place  it
depends wholly on herself to determine whether she shall sink down
into the rank of the middling powers of europe  or whether she shall
maintain the second place in the scale  if she continues this war  the
first will be her fate  if she stops short in her mad career and makes
peace  she may still be in the second predicament  america will grow
with astonishing rapidity  and england  france  and every other nation
in europe will be the better for her prosperity  peace  which is her
dear delight  will be her wealth and her glory  for i cannot see the
seed of a war with any part of the world in future  but with great
britain  and such states as may be weak enough  if any such there
should be  to become her allies  that such a peace may be speedily
concluded  and that you and i may return to our farms to enjoy the
fruits of it  spending our old age in recounting to our children the
toils and dangers we have encountered for their benefit  is the wish
of your friend

  my dear sir 

your letter of the 20th of june  by captain ayres  from boston  had a
quick passage  he sailed on the 4th of july  and your letters were
brought to passy from bordeaux  where she arrived the 3d of august 

i thank you  sir  for the kind expressions of your obliging anxiety
for me  the uncertainty in which you remain so long  concerning the
fate of the boston  must have been occasioned by the capture of many
vessels by which the news was sent  together with many bundles of
english newspapers and pamphlets  the prompt ratification of the
treaties  as well as the dignity with which you have received the
letters from the british commissioners  has given great satisfaction
here  the two articles  the count de vergennes agreed  when we
presented your instructions to him on that head  should be given up 

the confederation is an important object  and nothing is more wished
for in europe than its completion  and the finishing of the separate
governments  the eagerness to complete the american code  and the
strains of panegyric in which they speak and write of those parts of
it  which have been published in europe  are very remarkable  and seem
to indicate a general revolution in the sentiments of mankind upon the
subject of government  our currency cannot engage our attention too
much  and the more we think of it  the more we shall be convinced 
that taxation  deep and broad taxation  is the only sure and lasting
remedy  loans in europe will be very difficult to obtain  the powers
at war  or at the eve of war  have such vast demands  and offer terms
so much better than ours  that nothing but sheer benevolence to our
cause can induce any person to lend us  besides a large foreign debt
would be a greater evil  for what i know  than a paper currency 
moreover  your large drafts upon the commissioners here  from various
quarters  are like to consume more money than we can borrow  we shall
do however all we can 

i have hitherto had the good fortune to preserve a good understanding
with the gentleman you mention  and shall endeavor to continue it  i
have long known him to be employed very ably and usefully for our
country  and his merits and services  his integrity and abilities 
will induce me to cultivate his friendship  as far as i can 
consistently with the public service  i wish i could converse with you
freely upon this subject  but it would lead me into too long a detail 
it has given me much grief  since my arrival here  to find so little
harmony among many respectable characters  so many mutual jealousies 
and so much distrust of one another  as soon as i perceived it  i
determined neither to quarrel with any man here  because he had
quarrelled with another  or because another had quarrelled with him 
nor to make any man my bosom friend  because he was the bosom friend
of any other  but to attend solely to the public service  and give my
voice upon all occasions  as i should think that justice and policy
required  whether it agreed with the opinion of one man or another  i
cannot be more particular  if i were to take every man s word  i
should think there was not one disinterested american here  because it
is very certain  that there is nobody here  that everybody speaks well
of  there is no doubt to be made  that private interest has some
influence here upon some minds  and that our mercantile affairs and
competitions have occasioned some altercation  but there is  i think 
rather more of mutual reproaches of interested views and designs 
rather more of animosity among the americans here  than i remember to
have seen anywhere else  i will have nothing to do with any of these
things  i will have nothing to do with designs and endeavors to run
down characters  to paint in odious colors indifferent actions  to
excite or propagate suspicions without evidence  or to foment or
entertain prejudices of any kind  if i can possibly avoid it  i am
really ashamed to write to you in this enigmatical manner  which is
not natural to me  but i know not how to write clearer at present  i
sometimes differ in sentiment from each of my colleagues  and
sometimes agree with each  yet i do not trim  or at least i think i do
not  it has been and shall be my endeavor to heal and reconcile  to
the utmost of my power  yet i fear  that some gentlemen are gone over
to america  heated with altercation and inflamed with prejudice 
others still remain here  it is to be feared  in the same temper of
mind  and probably many letters are gone over loaded  these things
will probably make you uncomfortable  as they have and will make us  i
really wish  however  that you would remove the cause of this  and
appoint consuls to do the mercantile business  if you do not  however 
i am determined to go on  giving my voice clearly and without
equivocation  and at the same time without wrangling or ill will 

we expect on sunday  the 9th  the english accounts of the sea fight
between d orvilliers and keppel  which happened on the 27th ult  in
which the former obtained the laurels  whatever representation the
latter may make of it  there are so many facts  attested by so many
respectable witnesses  that there is no room to doubt  but that the
britons lost the day  a terrible loss indeed to a nation  who have the
empire of the sea to maintain  in order almost to preserve their
existence  it is not being equal to france at sea  they must support a
clear and decided superiority  not only to france  but to france and
spain in conjunction  not to mention our states  in order to preserve
their rank among the powers of europe  my tenderest respects to all
good men 

  i am  dear sir  affectionately yours

i have the honor to enclose the last gazettes  by which congress will
see the dearth of news in europe at present  we expect an abundance of
it at once soon  as we have nothing from america since the 4th of
july 

the french fleet went out again from brest the 17th  but we have not
yet heard that the english fleet is out  while the two fleets were in
the harbor  the british east india fleet  and another small west india
fleet  got in  a misfortune of no small moment  as the british
finances will receive by means of it a fresh supply of money for the
present  and their fleet a considerable reinforcement of seamen 

i have the honor to be  with the highest respect   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress all the newspapers i have by
me  enough to show that we have nothing very important here at
present  the french and british fleets are again at sea  and we hourly
expect intelligence of a second battle  but our expectations from
america are still more interesting and anxious  having nothing from
them since the 3d of july  except what is contained in the english
gazettes 

events have probably already passed in america  although not known in
europe  which will determine the great question  whether we shall
have a long war or a short one  the eyes of all europe are fixed upon
spain  whose armaments by sea and land are vastly expensive and
extremely formidable  but whose designs are a profound  impenetrable
secret  time  however  will discover them  in the meantime  we have
the satisfaction to be sure  that they are not inimical to america 
for this  we have the word of a king  signified by his ministers  a
king  who they say never breaks his word  but  on the contrary  has
given many striking proofs of his sacred regard to it 

i have the honor to be  with the greatest esteem   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the latest gazettes  we have
no other intelligence  than is contained in them 

since the 11th of july  the date of lord howe s announcing the arrival
of the count d estaing off sandy hook  we have not a syllable from
america  by the way of england  in france  we have nothing from
america since july 3d  this long interval leaves a vast scope for
imagination to play  and  accordingly  there is no end to the
speculations prompted by the hopes and fears of the nations of europe 
we are weary of conjectures  and must patiently wait for time to end
them 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect   c

  sir 

as our finances are  at present  in a situation seriously critical 
and as i hold myself accountable to congress for every part of my
conduct  even to the smallest article of my expenses  i must beg the
favor of you to consider what rent we ought to pay you for this house
and furniture  both for the time past and to come  every part of your
conduct towards me  and towards our americans in general  and in all
our affairs  has been polite and obliging  as far as i have had an
opportunity of observing  and i have no doubt it will continue so  yet
it is not reasonable  that the united states should be under so great
an obligation to a private gentleman  as that two of their
representatives should occupy  for so long a time  so elegant a seat 
with so much furniture and so fine accommodations without any
compensation  and in order to avoid the danger of the disapprobation
of our constituents on the one hand  for living here at too great or
at too uncertain an expense  and on the other  the censure of the
world for not making sufficient compensation to a gentleman  who has
done so much for our convenience  it seems to me necessary that we
should come to an eclaircissement upon this head 

as you have an account against the commissioners  or against the
united states  for several other matters  i should also be obliged to
you  if you would send it in as soon as possible  as every day renders
it more and more necessary for us to look into our affairs with the
utmost precision 

i am  sir  with much esteem and respect  your most obedient  humble
servant

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write to me
on the 15th inst  making inquiry as to the rent of my house  in which
you live  for the past and the future  when i consecrated my house to
dr franklin  and his associates  who might live with him  i made it
fully understood that i should expect no compensation  because i
perceived that you had need of all your means to send to the succor of
your country  or to relieve the distresses of your countrymen escaping
from the chains of their enemies  i pray you  sir  to permit this
arrangement to remain  which i made when the fate of your country was
doubtful  when she shall enjoy all her splendor  such sacrifices on my
part will be superfluous  or unworthy of her  but  at present  they
may be useful  and i am most happy in offering them to you 

there is no occasion for strangers to be informed of my proceeding in
this respect  it is so much the worse for those  who would not do the
same if they had the opportunity  and so much the better for me  to
have immortalized my house by receiving into it dr franklin and his
associates 

i have the honor to be  sir  with the most perfect respect   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the latest gazettes  which contain all the
news of europe  the news from america by the way of london  which are
contained in the _courier de l europe_ of the 15th instant  have
raised our expectations and increased our anxiety  we are not without
apprehensions  that the count d estaing may fall in with the combined
fleets of howe and byron 

the english are beginning to elevate their heads a little  and to
renew their old insolent language  both in coffee houses and in daily
papers  the refugees from america  unable to bear the thought of being
excluded forever from that country  and still less that of soliciting
for pardon from their injured countrymen  and returning to see
established principles  which they detest  and forms of government 
against which they have ever combated  are said to be indefatigable in
instilling hopes into the king and ministers  that by persevering
another campaign  and sending twenty thousand more men to america  the
people will be worn out  and glad to petition for dependence upon
them 

they flatter themselves and others with hopes  that spain will remain
neuter  and that by intriguing in france  they can get the french
ministry changed  and then that they shall have little trouble from
this quarter  nothing can be more whimsical  more groundless or
ridiculous  than all this  yet it is said to amuse and please the
credulous multitude in that devoted island  those  who pretend to know
the bosoms of the persons highest in power in that kingdom  say  that
they delight themselves with the thought  that if it is not in their
power to reduce america once more to their yoke  yet they are able to
harass  to distress  and to render miserable those whom they cannot
subdue  that they have some little compunction at the thought  that
they shall be ranked in history with the philips and alvas  the
alberts and gislers of this world  but this  instead of producing
repentance and reformation as it ought  engenders nothing but rage 
envy  and revenge  this revenge  however  is impotent  their marine
and their finances are in so bad a condition  that it is with infinite
difficulty they can cope with france alone  even at sea  and it seems
to be the intention of providence  that they shall be permitted to go
on with their cruelties  just long enough to wean the affection of
every american heart  and make room for connexions between us and
other nations  who have not the ties of language  of acquaintance  and
of custom to bind us 

i am  with the most perfect respect  sir  your most obedient  humble
servant

  sir 

i have received with much pleasure your favor of yesterday s date  no
apology was necessary for the delay of so few days to answer a letter 
the contents of which did not  from any public consideration  require
haste  my most fervent wishes mingle themselves with yours  that the
happy time may soon arrive when we may enjoy the blessings of peace 
uninterrupted by disputes with any power whatever  but alas  my
apprehensions are very strong  that we are yet at a distance from so
great a felicity 

you will readily acknowledge the impropriety of my entering into the
question concerning the duty of the commissioners here  to have made
the communications of the treaty  which you mention  but of this you
may be assured  that i shall at all times hold myself obliged to you
for the communication of your sentiments upon any public affair  i am
therefore sorry  that in your letter you have confined yourself to
that part of the treaty  upon which i particularly requested your
sentiments  and i now take the liberty to request your sentiments upon
every part of the treaty  which you conceive liable to doubtful
construction  or capable of producing discontent or dispute  for i
have the honor to be fully of your opinion  that it is of very great
importance to be upon our guard  and avoid every cause of controversy
with france as much as possible  she is  and will be  in spite of the
obstacles of language  of customs  religion  and government  our
natural ally against great britain as long as she shall continue our
enemy  and that will be at least as long as she shall hold a foot of
ground in america  however she may disguise it  and whatever peace or
truce she may make 

your sentiments of the fishery  as a source of wealth  of commerce and
naval power  are perfectly just  and therefore this object will and
ought to be attended to with precision  and cherished with care 
nevertheless  agriculture is the most essential interest of america 
and even of the massachusetts bay  and it is very possible to injure
both  by diverting too much of the thoughts and labor of the people
from the cultivation of the earth to adventures upon the sea  and
this  in the opinion of some persons  has been a fault in the
massachusetts bay  experience has taught us in the course of this war 
that the fishery was not so essential to our welfare as it was once
thought  necessity has taught us to dig in the ground instead of
fishing in the sea for our bread  and we have found that the resource
did not fail us 

the fishery was a source of luxury and vanity  that did us much
injury  yet this was the fault of the management  not of the fishery 
one part of our fish went to the west india islands for rum  and
molasses to be distilled into rum  which injured our health and our
morals  the other part went to spain and portugal for gold and silver 
almost the whole of which went to london  sometimes for valuable
articles of clothing  but too often for lace and ribands  if 
therefore  the cessation of the fishery for twenty years to come was
to introduce the culture of flax and wool  which it certainly would do
as far as would be necessary for the purposes of decency and comfort 
if a loss of wealth should be the consequence of it  the acquisition
of morals and of wisdom would perhaps make us gainers in the end 

these are vain speculations i know  the taste for rum and ribands will
continue  and there are no means for the new england people to obtain
them so convenient as the fishery  and therefore the first opportunity
will be eagerly embraced to revive it  as a nursery of seamen  and a
source of naval power  it has been  and is an object of serious
importance  and perhaps indispensably necessary to the accomplishment
and the preservation of our independence  i shall therefore always
think it my duty to defend and secure our rights to it with all
industry and zeal  and shall ever be obliged to you for your advice
and co operation 

pardon the length of this letter  and believe me  with much esteem 
your friend and servant

  sir 

i have the pleasure of yours of the 28th  and agree with you in
sentiment  that if the money  which has heretofore been squandered
upon articles of luxury  could for the future be applied to discharge
our national debt  it would be a great felicity  but is it certain
that it will  will not the national debt itself be the means  at least
a temptation to continue  if not increase the luxury  it is with great
pleasure that i see you mention sumptuary laws  but is there room to
hope that our legislatures will pass such laws  or that the people
have  or can be persuaded to acquire those qualities  that are
necessary to execute such laws  i wish your answer may be in the
affirmative  and that it may be found true in fact and experience  but
much prudence and delicacy will be necessary  i think  to bring all
our countrymen to this just way of thinking upon this head  there is
such a charm to the human heart in elegance  it is so flattering to
our self love to be distinguished from the world in general by
extraordinary degrees of splendor  in dress  in furniture  equipage 
buildings   c  and our countrymen  by their connexion with europe  are
so much infected with the habit of this taste and these passions  that
i fear it will be a work of time and difficulty  if not quite
impracticable  to introduce an alteration  to which the late condition
of our trade and currency  besides the great inequality of fortune 
and the late enterprises introduced by privateers  are dangerous
enemies 

you ask my opinion  whether the reasons in your last letter are well
founded  it is observable  that the french court were not content
with the treaty proposed by congress  which contained all  in my
opinion  which is contained in the article as it now stands in the
treaty of the 6th of february  what motive they had for inserting the
words   indefinite and exclusive   is left to conjecture  39  the
suspicion  that they meant more than the treaty proposed by congress
expressed  arises from a fact  which you remember  viz  that the
french at the time of the last peace claimed more  i wish to know if
there is any letter or memorial extant  in which such a claim is
contained  or whether it was only a verbal claim made by their
ambassadors  whether any of the magazines of that time mention and
discuss any such claim  if the fact is incontestible  that they made
such a claim  it is possible that it may be revived under the words
 indefinite and exclusive   but i hope it will not  and i hope it was
not intended when these words were inserted  yet i confess i cannot
think of any other reason for inserting them  the word indefinite is
not amiss  for it is a right of catching fish and drying them on land 
which is a right indefinite enough  but the word exclusive is more
mysterious  it cannot mean that americans and all other nations shall
be  excluded  from the same right of fishing and drying on land 
between the same limits of bonavista and riche  it would be much
easier to suppose  that the following words   in that part only  and
in no other besides that   gave rise to the word  exclusive   that is 
that right of fishing and drying within those limits  for which we
have excluded ourselves from all others  i will undertake to show
better reasons  or at least as good  for this sense of the word
exclusive  as the most subtle interpreter of treaties can offer for
the other  although i think them both untenable 

my opinion further is this  that as contemporaneous exposition is
allowed by all writers on the law of nations to be the best
interpreter of treaties  as well as of all other writings  and as
neither the treaty of utrecht  or the treaty of paris in 1763  ever
received such an interpretation as you are apprehensive may hereafter
be contended for  and as the uninterrupted practice has been against
such a construction  so i think that the treaty of paris of the 6th of
february  1778  is not justly liable to such a construction  and that
it cannot be attempted with any prospect of success  i agree with you 
however  that as we are young states  and not practised in the art of
negotiation  it becomes us to look into all these things with as much
caution and exactness as possible  and furnish ourselves with the best
historical light  and every other honest means of securing our rights 
for which reason i requested your sentiments upon this subject in
writing  and continue to desire in the same way your observations on
other parts of the treaty  reduced to writing  such things remain in
letters and letter books  as well as more distinctly in the memory 
and the same men or other men may recur to them at future
opportunities  whereas transient conversations  especially among men
who have many things to do and to think of  slip away and are
forgotten  i shall make use of all the prudence i can  that these
letters may not come to the knowledge of improper persons  or be used
to the disadvantage of our country  or to you or me in our present
capacity 

  i am   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the latest gazettes  by which congress
will perceive  that we have no intelligence from america since the
departure of the count d estaing from sandy hook  our anxiety is very
great  but we hope that a few hours will relieve it  in the midst of a
war in germany  and between france and england  there was scarcely
ever a greater dearth of news in a profound peace 

captain mc neil  the bearer of this  makes the most conversation 
having taken and destroyed  i think  thirteen vessels in the course of
his last cruise  six of which have safely arrived in france  the
others  not destroyed  he sent to america  his cruise will prove a
great disappointment to the enemy  having deprived them of a great
quantity of naval stores  upon which they depended

  sir 

while we officially communicate to you the enclosed resolve  the
foundation of which you cannot remain a stranger to  we must entreat
you to be assiduous in sending to those commissioners who have left
france  and gone to the courts for which  they were respectively
appointed  all the american intelligence  which you have greater
opportunity than they of receiving from hence  particularly to mr
izard and mr william lee  we do not often send more than one set of
gazettes by one opportunity  and we hear of several vessels which have
miscarried 

congress must and will speedily determine upon the general arrangement
of their foreign affairs  this is become  so far as regards you 
peculiarly necessary  upon a new commission being sent to dr franklin 
in the meantime we hope you will exercise your whole extensive
abilities on the subject of our finances  the doctor will communicate
to you our situation in that regard 

to the gazettes  and to conversation with the marquis de lafayette  we
must refer you for what relates to our enemies  and close with our
most cordial wishes for your happiness

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the latest newspapers  as they
contain the speech at the opening of parliament  and some of the
debates in both houses  upon the addresses in answer to it  they are
of very great importance  i learn by some newspapers and private
letters  that an opinion has been prevalent in america  that the enemy
intended to withdraw from the united states  and considering the cruel
devastations of the war  and the unfortunate situation of our
finances  nothing would give me so much joy  as to see reasons to
concur in that opinion  and to furnish congress with intelligence in
support of it  but i am sorry to say the reverse is too apparent  we
may call it obstinacy or blindness  if we will  but such is the state
of parties in england  so deep would be the disgrace  and perhaps so
great the personal danger to those who have commenced and prosecuted
this war  that they cannot but persevere in it at every hazard  and
nothing is clearer in my mind  than that they never will quit the
united states until they are either driven or starved out of them  i
hope  therefore  congress will excuse me for suggesting  that there is
but one course for us to take  which is to concert every measure  and
exert every nerve  for the total destruction of the british power
within the united states 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

it is necessary that you should be minutely informed of the minutest
and most secret springs of action here  if it is possible  yet the
danger is so great of our letters being taken  and getting into
english newspapers  that it is very discouraging to a free
correspondence  i will  however  take all the precaution in my power
to have the letters sunk  but if all these fail  and my letters become
public  the world must take them as they find them  and i hope they
will do more good upon the whole than harm 

this court and nation appear to me  to be well convinced of the
utility to their interests of the american alliance  but
notwithstanding this  they appear to me to have too much diffidence of
us  too much diffidence of the people of america  and too much
reserve towards the commissioners here  i am not satisfied in the
cause of this  whether they think  that the obstacles of language 
religion  laws  customs and manners  are obstacles in the way of a
perfect friendship  which cannot be removed  and therefore that they
shall lose our connexion as soon as britain comes to her senses  or
whether they are embarrassed by the conduct of spain  and are acting
in this reserved manner  and with an appearance of irresolution in
hopes of her coming in  or whether they have any prejudices against
the personal characters of the commissioners  and are loth to be
unreserved with them  for fear they shall communicate either
indiscreetly or by design anything to the english  or to anybody here 
who might convey it to england  or whether all these motives together
have a share in it  i know not  thus much is certain  that ever since
i have been here  i have never seen any disposition in any minister of
state to talk with any of the commissioners  either upon intelligence
from spain or england  upon the designs or negotiations of either  or
any other court in europe  or upon the conduct of the war by sea or
land  or upon their own plans or designs of policy or war  if this
reserve was ever thrown off to any one  i should think  that putting
it on to others had some personal motive  but it is exactly equal and
alike to all three 

each commissioner here  before i came  had his own set of friends 
admirers  and dependents  both among the french and americans  two
households united in some degree against one  very unjustly  i fear 
and very impolitically  but this set the friends of the two to
injuring the third in conversation  and they cannot forbear to do it 
to this day  this dissension  i suspect  has made the ministry
cautious  lest in the course of altercations  improper use should be
made of free communications  for my own part  however odd you may
think it in me to say it  i have no friends  much less dependents 
here  and am determined to have none  for i am convinced  that
competitions among these have done the evil  but i am determined  if i
am continued here  to have free communication with the ministry upon
these subjects and to search them to the bottom  the ministry are
candid men and sensible  and i am sure  that some eclaircissements
would do good 

however  i am reckoning without my host  for by the bruits  which mr
deane s letters have scattered  i may expect  that the first vessel
will bring my recall or removal to some other court  but wherever i
am  my heart will ever be anxious for the good of our country  and
warm with friendship for her friends  among whom you will ever be
reckoned in the foremost rank  by your most obedient

i have had the honor to enclose to congress the speech at the opening
of the british parliament by several opportunities  but as it opens
the intention of the enemy  and warns us to be prepared for all the
evils  which are in their power to inflict  and not in our power to
prevent  i enclose it again in another form 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect

  dear sir 

from the long series of arduous services in which we have acted
together  i have had experience enough of your accurate judgment  in
cases of difficulty  to wish very often that i could have the benefit
of it here  to me it appears  that there will be no more cordial
friendship  nor for many years to come any long peace between great
britain and america  and therefore the french alliance is and will be
an important barrier to us  and ought to be cultivated with perfect
faith and much tenderness  but still it is a delicate and dangerous
connexion  there is danger to the simplicity of our manners  and to
the principles of our constitution  and there may be danger that too
much will be demanded of us  there is danger  that the people and
their representatives may have too much timidity in their conduct
towards this power  and that your ministers here may have too much
diffidence of themselves  and too much complaisance for the court 
there is danger  that french councils  and emissaries  and
correspondents may have too much influence in our deliberations 

i hope that this court will not interfere  by attaching themselves to
persons  parties  or measures in america  it would be ill policy  but
no court is always directed by sound policy  and we cannot be too much
upon our guard  some americans will naturally endeavor to avail
themselves of the aid of the french influence  to raise their
reputation  to extend their influence  to strengthen their parties 
and in short to promote the purposes of private ambition and
interest  but these things must be guarded against 

i wish for a letter from you as often as you can  and that you would
believe me your friend 

                                                           john adams

                                            passy  december 8th  1778 

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress one other copy of the speech
at the opening of parliament  together with the debates in consequence
of it 

the hints in those debates  especially those given out by lord
suffolk  are confirmed by the general strain of intelligence from
london  letters from persons  who are supposed to know  announce the
determination of the cabinet to be  that clinton and byron  with their
fleet and army  shall ravage the coast  and bombard and pillage the
towns  that their army in canada shall be reinforced  and that parties
of regulars  with such tories and indians as they can persuade to join
them  shall ravage  burn  and massacre on the frontiers of
massachusetts bay  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  virginia and
the carolinas 

their magnificent menaces we know it is not in their power to execute
entirely  yet we may depend they will do as much as they can  they
will neither acknowledge our independence  nor withdraw their fleets
and armies  nor shall we get rid of them  but by destroying them  or
making them prisoners  until the nation is so exhausted  and their
credit so sunk  that the minister can raise no more money 

it has been usual to consider this as a ministerial war  but i have
ever thought  they would some time or other discover it to be a
national war  the few men of the nation  who think seriously of the
business  see clearly in the long train of consequences of american
independence the loss of their west india islands  a great part of
their east india trade  the total loss of canada  nova scotia  the
floridas  all the american fisheries  a diminution of their naval
power  as well as national bankruptcy  and a revolution in their
government in favor of arbitrary power  and the nation in general has
a confused dread of all these things upon its spirits 

the inference they draw from all this is to go on with the war  and
make it more cruel  which is the way in the opinion of impartial
persons to make all their gloomy visions realities  whereas the only
way to prevent them is to make peace now  before a total alteration
takes place on both sides  however  all we can do is to be prepared
for the worst they can do 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect   c

  sir 

your favors of may 9th and 16th from brest  we duly received  we
congratulate you on your success  and safe arrival at brest  as well
as on the honor you have acquired by your conduct and bravery in
taking one of the king s ships 

as we have some expectation of obtaining an exchange of prisoners from
england  we would advise you to keep those you have made securely
confined  though in a manner most consistent with humanity  till we
have an answer from thence  for if we can get an equal number of our
own seamen to man the drake  she will be an additional strength to you
in a future expedition  whereas sending her with the prisoners to
america  will not only weaken you by the hands you must spare to
navigate her  and to keep the prisoners in subjection  but will also
hazard their being retaken  we should have been happy to have been
early informed of the particulars of your cruise  and of the prizes
you have made  of which we have no authentic advice to this hour 

your bill of exchange in favor of m  bussolle for twentyfour thousand
livres  which you inform us you mean to distribute among the brave
officers and men to whom you owe your late success has been presented
to us by m  chaumont  we are sorry to inform you  that we have been
under the disagreeable necessity of refusing payment  and that for
several reasons  first  because your application should have been made
to m  schweighauser  who is the person regularly authorised to act as
continental agent at brest  and we are determined that all american
concerns  within our department  shall go through his hands  as long
as he shall continue in the character of american agent  or at least
until we shall find it necessary to order otherwise  secondly  because
the bill is drawn for an expense  which we have no right or authority
to defray  we have no authority to make presents of the public money
to officers or men  however gallant and deserving  for the purpose of
providing their families with clothing  or for any other purpose  nor
to advance them money upon the credit of their share of prizes  nor
have we authority to advance them any part of their pay or bounties 
all these things belong to congress alone  and must be done by the
proper boards in america  our authority extends no further than to
order the necessary repairs to be made to your ship  to order her to
be furnished with necessary victuals  which we are ready to order m 
schweighauser to do as soon as we shall be informed by you what
repairs and victuals are wanted  with an estimate of the amount of the
expenses 

there is one thing further  which we should venture to do for the
benefit of your men  upon a representation from you of the quantity of
slops necessary for them  we should order m  schweighauser to furnish
your ship with them  not more however than one suit of clothes for
each man  that you may take them on board of your ship  and deliver
them out to the men as they shall be wanted  charging each man upon
the ship s books with what he shall receive  that it may be deducted
out of his pay 

lieutenant simpson has stated to us your having put him under arrest
for disobeying orders  as a court martial must  by order of congress 
consist of three captains  three lieutenants  and three captains of
marines  and these cannot be had here  it is our desire that he may
have a passage procured for him by the first opportunity to america 
allowing him whatever may be necessary for his defence  as the
consequences of an arrest in foreign countries are thus extremely
troublesome  they should be well considered before they are made  if
you are in possession of any resolution of congress  giving the whole
of ships of war when made prizes to the captors  we should be obliged
to you for a copy of it  we should also be obliged to you for a
particular account in whose hands the prizes made by you are  and in
what forwardness is the sale of them  we have the honor to be   c

  sir 

we have received sundry letters from lieutenant simpson  and sundry
certificates from officers and others  concerning his behavior in
general  and particularly upon that occasion in which he is charged
with disobedience of orders  without giving or forming any decided
opinion concerning his guilt or innocence of the crime laid to his
charge  we may venture to say  that the certificates we have received
are very favorable to his character  and at least afford reason to
hope  that he did not mean to disobey his orders  be this however as
it may  we are constrained to say  that his confinement on board of
any other ship than the ranger  and much more his confinement in a
prison on shore  appears to us to carry in it a degree of severity 
which cannot be justified by reason or law  we therefore desire you
would release mr simpson from his imprisonment  and permit him to go
at large upon his parole to go to nantes  there to take his passage to
america by the first favorable opportunity  in order to take his trial
by a court martial 

we request you to transmit to us as soon as possible  an account of
what is due to lieutenant simpson  according to the ship s books  for
wages 

an application has been made to us in behalf of mr andrew fallen  one
of the prisoners lately made by you  and his case represented with
such circumstances as have induced us to request you to let mr fallen
go where he will  after taking his parole in writing  that he will not
communicate any intelligence  which may be prejudicial to the united
states  that he will not take arms against them during the war  and
that he will surrender himself prisoner of war  whenever called upon
by congress  or their ministers at paris  we are  sir   c

we have received several letters from you  and several certificates
from officers and others  respecting your behavior in general  as well
as particularly relative to the charge of disobedience of orders  for
which you have been confined  it would be improper for us to give any
opinion concerning this charge  which is to be determined only by a
court martial  but we have requested captain jones to set you at
liberty upon your parole to go to nantes  there to take your passage
to america by the first favorable opportunity  in order to take your
trial by a court martial  40 

  we are  sir  your humble servants

  gentlemen 

i had yesterday the honor of your favor of the 28th of october 
enclosing a resolution of congress  of the 22d of the same month  to
which i shall give all the attention in my power  41  i have much
satisfaction in the reflection  that i have hitherto endeavored with
much sincerity to conform to the spirit of it  what you recommend to
me  viz  to communicate to the ministers of other courts such
intelligence as i may receive  will not in future be so much in my
power  but as far as i can  while i stay in europe  i shall endeavor
to comply  indeed  it is a long time that we have had no intelligence
to communicate  three vessels we know have been taken  each of which
had many letters  and two of them public despatches  one that sailed
from philadelphia the 4th of november  another that sailed from the
same port the 24th  and another that sailed from boston on the 20th 
these letters and despatches were all sunk  and we fear that others
are lost 

it would be agreeable to me  indeed  if i were able to throw any light
on the subject of finances  as to a loan in europe  all has been done
that was in our power to this end  but without the desired effect 
taxation and economy comprehend all the resources that i can think of 

we expect the honor of a visit from the marquis de lafayette this
morning  whom we shall receive with gratitude for his gallant and
glorious exertions in one of the best causes in which a hero ever
fought 

be pleased to accept my thanks for your kind wishes for my happiness 
and believe me to be your affectionate friend

  my dear sir 

the marquis de lafayette did me the honor of a visit yesterday  and
delivered me your favor of the 25th of october  i am not sorry  as
things have been ordered  that mine of may 24th did not reach you till
the 24th of october  because  as the new arrangement 42  was
previously made  it cannot be said that i had any hand in
accomplishing it  yet i am glad the letter has arrived  because it
will show that the new system is quite agreeable to me  that is  the
appointment of a single minister here  believe me  sir  it was become
very necessary 

footnote 

   42  dissolving the commission in paris  and appointing dr franklin
  minister plenipotentiary 

how congress will dispose of me  i do not know  if it is intended that
i shall return  this will be very agreeable to me  and i think that
this is the most probable opinion  because mr deane s  address  was on
the 5th of december  congress soon after resolved to enter on foreign
affairs and go through them  the alliance sailed on the 14th of
january  and there is no resolution arrived here respecting me  i
think  therefore  that it is my duty to return  and that is my present
determination  but whether i shall go to amsterdam  and from thence to
st eustatia  or to spain  and thence home  or in a french man of war
to martinique  or an american frigate to america  i have not decided 
some hint that i am to go to holland  others to spain  this last
implies the removal of mr lee  which would give me much pain on many
accounts  i think him a faithful man and able  yet what the
determination will be upon the complaint of mr deane  i cannot say 
this is a subject which i cannot write or talk about  i would not feel
such another sensation to be made a prince  i confess i expected the
most dismal consequences from it  because i thought it would render
business and confidence between us three totally impracticable  that
it would destroy all confidence between this court and us  and that it
would startle spain  that it would alienate many in holland from us 
and that it would encourage the ministry in england and disconcert
opposition so much  that they would even make another vigorous
campaign  besides all the evils it would produce among you  but the
arrival of dr franklin s commission has relieved me from many of these
fears  this court have confidence in him alone  but i think they were
cautious  even of him  when he had two colleagues  to whom he was
obliged to communicate everything  one of whom was upon as bad terms
with him as with mr deane  i have had a kind of a task here  as mr
lovell expresses himself  determined to be the partizan of neither 
yet to be the friend of both  as far as the service would admit  i am
fixed in these two opinions  that leaving the doctor here alone is
right  and that mr lee is a very honest and faithful man 

you say that france should be our polar star in case war should take
place  i was  i confess  surprised at this expression  was not war
sufficiently declared in the king of england s speech  and in the
answers of both houses  and in the recall of his ambassador  has it
not been sufficiently declared by actual hostilities in most parts of
the world  i suspect there will never be any other declaration of war 
yet  there is in fact as complete a war as ever existed  and it will
continue  for you may depend upon it  the king of france is immovably
fixed in your support  and so are his ministers  every suspicion of a
wavering disposition in this court concerning the support of american
independence is groundless  is ridiculous  is impossible  you may
remember  that several years ago  several gentlemen were obliged to
reason  to show that american independence was the interest of france 
since my arrival in this kingdom  i never yet found one man  nor heard
of more than one  who doubted it  if the voice of popularity is
anything  i assure you that this voice was never so unanimous in
america in favor of our independence as it is here  it is so much so 
that if the court were to depart from its present system in this
respect  it is my clear opinion it would make this nation very
unhappy  and the court too  but i again repeat  that the court is as
fixed as the nation  and this union of sentiment arises out of such
principles in nature  as  without a miracle  cannot alter  common
sense in america supported independence  common sense in france
supports the alliance  and will support it to the last  nay  the
common sense of europe supports the common sense of france 

by the way  my regards to mr paine  and tell him  that i do not agree
with him in his ideas about natural enemies  it is because england is
the natural enemy of france  that america in her present situation is
her natural friend  at least  this is one cause  although there are
many others  some of them are more glorious  for human nature 

france scarcely ever made a war before  that was popular in europe 
there is not a state  that i can hear of  but applauds her  and wishes
her success  and in point of finance and naval strength  and in skill
and bravery of officers  she seems to be superior to england  you may
be surprised to hear me say naval strength  yet if you consider the
wretched state of the british navy  as to masts  yards  rigging  and
men  you will not wonder  although their number of ships may be
superior  i therefore think  that all is safe  we may have further
trouble  and trials of our faith and patience  but trouble is to you
and me familiar  and i begin to think it necessary for my health 

there is one thing in my letter to you exaggerated  the expenses of
the commissioners  i had been here but a short time  and wrote
according to the best guess i could make  from what i had heard  but i
now think i put it much too high  yet i cannot say exactly  43 

_february 20th _ there is not the least appearance of the embarkation
of troops for america  nor any intelligence of transports taken up 
the national discontent is great  and tumults have arisen in edinburgh
and london  according to present appearances  they will have occasion
for so many of their troops to keep their populace in order  as to be
able to spare few for america  their proclamations are all alike from
burgoyne s to those of the commissioners  the weaker they are  the
more they puff 

  i am   c

  sir 

last evening i had the honor of your letter of the 13th of this month 
in answer to mine of the 11th  44 

i thank your excellency for the politeness with which you have agreed
to my proposition  of a conference upon the subject of mr deane s
 address to the people of the united states  

at the time when my letter of the 11th was written and sent to your
excellency  there were three commissioners here  representatives of
congress  between whom it appeared to me mr deane s address had a
tendency to destroy all confidence  as well as between your excellency
and them  for which reason i thought it my duty to endeavor  by a
conference with your excellency  to lessen those evils as far as
should be in my power 

but within a few hours after my letter of the 11th was sent  the
aid de camp of the marquis de lafayette arrived  with despatches from
congress to dr franklin  and from their committee of foreign affairs
to me  informing me of the new arrangement by which dr franklin is
constituted minister plenipotentiary here  and i am restored to the
character of a private citizen  by which  so wholly changed are the
scene and the characters here  that i now think i have no right to do
what  if i had continued in the character of a commissioner  i should
have thought it my indispensable duty to do 

this masterly measure of congress  which has my most hearty
approbation  and of the necessity of which i was fully convinced
before i had been two months in europe  has taken away the
possibilities of those dissensions  which i so much apprehended  i
shall not  therefore  give your excellency any further trouble  than
to take an opportunity of paying my respects in order to take leave 
and to assure you  that i shall leave this kingdom with the most
entire confidence in his majesty s benevolence to the united states 
and inviolable adherence to the treaties between the two powers  with
a similar confidence in the good disposition of his majesty s
ministers of state and of this nation towards us  and with a heart
impressed with gratitude for the many civilities which i have
received  in the short space i have resided here  at brest  in the
city  and in the country  and particularly from your excellency 

  i have the honor to be   c

  my dear marquis 

the conversation with which you honored me last evening  has induced
me to give you the trouble of this letter upon the same subject 

it is certain that a loan of money is very much needed to redeem the
redundancy of our paper bills  and without it  it is impossible to
foresee what will be the consequence to their credit  and therefore
every service  that may be rendered in order to obtain it from this
kingdom  from spain  or holland  will be a most acceptable service 

but without some other exertions  even a loan perhaps would be but a
temporary relief  with them a smaller loan might suffice  you know
perfectly well  that the enemy in america are at present very weak 
and in great distress in every part  they are weak in canada  weak in
halifax  weak in rhode island  weak in new york  weak in the floridas 
and weak in every one of the west india islands  a strong armament of
ships of the line  with five thousand troops  directed against
halifax  rhode island  or new york  must infallibly succeed  so it
must against the floridas  so it must against canada  or any one of
the west india islands 

you are very sensible  that in this state of weakness  the british
possessions in america depend upon each other for reciprocal support 
the troops and ships derive such supplies of provisions from canada
and nova scotia  that if these places or either of them were lost  it
would be difficult  if not impossible  for the other to subsist  the
west india islands derive such supplies from the floridas  that if
they were lost the others could hardly subsist  their fleets and
armies in canada  halifax  rhode island  new york  and the floridas 
receive supplies of rum  sugar  molasses   c  from the west india
islands  without which they could scarcely subsist  every part of
their possessions in america  both on the continent and in the
islands  receives constant supplies from europe  from england 
scotland  and ireland  without which they must fall  you perceive 
therefore  that their dominions in america at present form such a
chain  that the links mutually support each other in such a manner 
that if one or two were taken away  the whole  or at least the greater
part  must fall  in this state of things then  the obvious policy is
to send a strong squadron of ships of the line to co operate with the
count d estaing and the american army  in some expedition directed
against new york  rhode island  halifax or perhaps all of them in
course  five or six thousand troops would be quite enough  above all 
it is indispensably necessary to keep a clear naval superiority  both
on the coast of the continent  and in the west islands  this together
with french and american privateers would make such havoc among the
enemy s transports  passing from one of their possessions to another 
as must ruin their affairs  the french have a great advantage in
carrying on this kind of war in america  at present  the british ships
are badly manned and in bad repair  they cannot send them into the
american seas  without the utmost terror for their own coasts  and
when they are in america  they have not such advantages for supplies
of provisions  naval stores   c  as the french 

the devastation  which was made among their ships of the line 
frigates  transports  and traders  in the american seas the last
summer  shows how much might be done  if a stronger force were sent
there  as long as the enemy have possession of new york and rhode
island  so long it will be necessary for us to keep up large armies 
to watch their motions  and defend the country against them  which
will oblige us to emit more paper  and still further to increase the
depreciation  now as long as they maintain the dominion of those seas 
their troops will be protected by the cannon of their ships  and we
could not dislodge them with an army  however large  at least we could
not keep possession of those places  but if their force was captivated
in those seas  as it might easily be by a sea force  co operating with
the land forces  we might reduce our army and innumerable other
articles of expense  we need not emit any more paper  and that already
out would depreciate no further  i should be happy to have further
conversation with you  sir  upon these subjects  or to explain
anything by letter  which may be in my power 

with the highest sentiments of esteem and respect  i have the honor to
be   c

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you have done me the honor to write
me on the 16th of this month  although you are to be henceforth
without a public character in france  be persuaded that the esteem and
consideration  which you have justly acquired  are by no means
diminished  and i flatter myself  sir  that you will not deprive me of
the pleasure of assuring you of it by word of mouth  and being at the
same time the interpreter of the favorable sentiments with which the
king honors you  they are the consequence of the particular
satisfaction  which his majesty has received from the wise conduct you
have held during the whole time of your commission  as well as the
zeal you have constantly displayed  both for the cause of your
country  and for the support of the alliance which attaches it to his
majesty 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect   c

  sir 

i have received the letter  which your excellency did me the honor to
write me on the 21st of this month  this testimony from your
excellency of those indulgent sentiments  with which his majesty is
pleased to honor my sincere intentions  cannot fail to be preserved by
me and my posterity as a most precious monument  and what is of
infinitely more importance  it cannot fail to give great satisfaction
to my country  to find that a servant of theirs  who has been honored
with no small share of their confidence in the most dangerous of
times  and most critical circumstances  has been so happy as not to
forfeit the confidence of their illustrious ally

  sir 

by the new arrangement  which was brought by the marquis de lafayette 
i find myself restored to the character of a private citizen 

the appointment of a single minister at the court of versailles was
not unexpected to me  because i had not been two months in europe
before i was convinced of the policy  and indeed of the necessity  of
such a measure  but i ever entertained hopes  that when the news of
such an alteration should arrive  the path of my own duty would have
been made plain to me by the directions of congress  either to return
home or go elsewhere  but as no information that we have received from
congress has expressed their intentions concerning me  i am obliged to
collect them by implication  according to the best of my
understanding  and as the election of the new minister plenipotentiary
was on the fourteenth of september  and the alliance sailed from
boston the fourteenth of january  and in this space of four months no
notice appears to have been taken of me  i think the only inference
that can be made is  that congress have no further service for me on
this side the water  and that all my duties are on the other  i have
accordingly given notice to his excellency  m  de sartine  and to his
excellency the minister plenipotentiary here  of my intentions to
return  which i shall do by the first frigate that sails for any part
of the united states  unless i should receive counter orders in the
meantime  in a matter of so much uncertainty  i hope i shall not incur
the disapprobation of congress  even if i should not judge aright of
their intentions  which it is my desire as well as my duty to observe 
as far as i can know them 

by the papers enclosed with this  congress will perceive the
discontented and tumultuous state of the three kingdoms of england 
scotland  and ireland  which is so great and so rapidly increasing 
that the united states will have little to fear from reinforcements of
their enemies the ensuing campaign  all their forces will be necessary
to keep in order their own riotous populace  and to replace those
which are daily consuming in the west indies  there is  however  no
prospect of their evacuating either new york or rhode island  the
possession of those places is so indispensable for the preservation of
their west india and other trade  as well as of their other dominions
in america  that nothing but the last necessity will induce them to
give them up 

the greatest source of danger and unhappiness to the states then
probably will be a depreciating currency  the prospect of a loan in
europe  after every measure that has been or could be taken  i think
it my duty to say frankly to congress  is very unpromising  the causes
of this are very obvious  and cannot be removed  the state of our
country itself  and the course of exchange  would be sufficient to
discourage such a loan  if there were no other obstruction  but there
are many others  there are more borrowers in europe than lenders  and
the british loan itself will not be made this year at a less interest
than seven and a half per cent 

i see no hope of relief  but from economy and taxation  and those i
flatter myself will be found sufficient  if the people are once
convinced of the necessity of them  when a people are contending not
only for the greatest object  that any people ever had in view  but
for security from the greatest evil that any nation ever had to dread 
 for there is at this hour no medium between unlimited subjugation to
parliament and entire sovereignty  they must be destitute of sense as
well as of virtue  if they are not willing to pay sufficient sums
annually to defray the necessary expense of their defence in future 
supported as they are by so powerful an ally  and by the prospect of
others  against a kingdom already exhausted  without any ally at all 
or a possibility of obtaining one  as this is the first time i have
had the honor to address myself to congress  since we received the
news of your excellency s appointment to the chair  you will please
to accept of my congratulations on that event 

  i have the honor to be  with the highest esteem   c

  sir 

my last letter to congress was on the twentyseventh of last month 
since which an account of the new loan is received from london  and as
this may  perhaps  afford to congress the clearest proof of the
weakness of their enemies  it is of importance  that it should be
transmitted to them  some accounts say  that the loan is to be seven
millions  others eight  the conditions of the loan are  in general 
the established interest of three per cent  an annuity for three and
three quarters per cent for twentynine years  and seven lottery
tickets for every thousand pounds 

in one account the advantages are thus stated 

  100 3 per cent                                       £61 00 00
  £3 15s  annuity for twentynine years  at
    twelve years  purchase                              45 00 00
  two fifths of a year s interest and annuity  gained
    by both beginning from the 5th of january 
    although the money is paid monthly  and
    not ended until december                             2 14 00
  £3 premium of seven lottery tickets for each
    £1000  gives for each hundred                        2  2 00
                                                                
  for each £100 paid  there is received               £110 16 00

this statement for the first year is pretty accurate  another account
makes it ten and one quarter per cent for the first year  the
subsequent years  however it will not be so much  yet for all the
subsequent years  during the term of the annuity  it will be six and
three quarters per cent  upon the whole  it is generally looked upon
as good as seven and a half per cent  in a country where the highest
interest  that is tolerated by the standing laws  is five per cent 
this is a terrible symptom 

while this system has any credit among the money lenders in holland 
switzerland  geneva   c  congress will perceive  that there is little
hope of procuring a private loan for the united states from any of
those places  whether any may be procured from any state  or prince 
time must discover 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

i beg leave to apply to you  in an instance where i am much concerned 
the case i shall lay before you  and recommend to your care  there is
an officer in paris  whom i wish to send over to america on board the
alliance  and who i know would be of service in the american army  for
that reason  besides his recommendations  i have a great regard for
him  i wish the gentleman may find a passage in the frigate  dr
franklin cannot officially send an officer  but i beg you would take
him along with you  as i take upon myself the charge of presenting him
to congress  all the marks of kindness i ever met with from them  and
the knowledge which the strictest friendship has given me of general
washington s sentiments  make me as certain as possible  that my
officer will meet with the best reception in philadelphia and in the
army  who know i am acquainted with what may be convenient to them 

it is with a great concern  that i hear of discontents between captain
landais and his officers  and i flatter myself  that you will again
establish harmony and concord among them  i will take the opportunity
of this frigate to write over to my friends in america 

the articles alluded to in your letter from passy  i have been very
busy about  but i did not meet with great success till now  and what
is done is not equal to what i could wish  it is true  our
circumstances are rather narrow at this moment  and i believe  that
the ministers are willing to do what they think possible  or
advantageous  but we do not always agree in opinion  i hope  however 
america will have more and more occasions of knowing the true
attachment of this nation for her 

with great impatience i wait for your answer  that i may send the
officer to nantes  i hope you will not refuse your patronage on this
occasion  and i may answer congress will have no objection to take a
gentleman whom i send them  you will  my dear sir  in settling his
passage  much oblige your humble servant

  dear sir 

your favors of june the 2d and 5th are now before me  that of the 29th
of march i have answered  if i ever received it  for i have answered
every one i have received from you  but not having my papers at hand
cannot be particular  i thank you for the manuscript and the pamphlet 

i am happy to hear from you  and from all others  so agreeable a
character of the chevalier de la luzerne  and m  marbois  the last of
whom i have had the pleasure to see 

i wish it was in my power to do more for mr ford  and to take him with
me  but the frigate will be so crowded  i fear it will be impossible 

the declarations of the northern powers against the right of england
to stop their merchant vessels  and arming to support their rights 
are important events  the displacing of mr paine is a disagreeable and
alarming one 

it is with no small astonishment  that i learn by your letter of the
5th  that by advices from america since your last to me  your enemies
are determined to impeach your attachment to our country and her
cause  your request that i would give my opinion on that subject  from
the knowledge i have had of your conduct  while we acted in commission
together  can meet with no objection from me  but i hope i need not
inform you  that my opinion upon this point is no secret at
versailles  paris  nantes  or elsewhere  enclosed is a copy of a
letter i did myself the honor to write to his excellency the count de
vergennes some time ago  which  for anything i know  is communicated
to all the court  but the answer shows that it was received  i had my
reasons then for keeping it to myself  which exist now no more  i
would transcribe the whole correspondence if it was in my power  but i
have not time  and it is sufficient to say  that it was conducted by
his excellency with the most obliging politeness  it is my duty now to
furnish you with a copy  lest any accident may befal me  which is by
no means improbable  i thought then  and am confirmed in that opinion
more and more  that it was my duty to communicate my sentiments at
court  upon that very extraordinary occasion  and from regard to my
own reputation  i am very glad you have given me an opportunity of
furnishing you with evidence  that i did this part of my duty so far
forth  the letter was written  sent to versailles  and received by his
excellency before the arrival of the marquis de lafayette  his
aid de camp  or dr winship  that is  before the news reached passy of
the new arrangement  45  but lest that letter should not be
sufficient  i shall enclose another certificate  not without a
heartfelt grief  that malice should have been so daring and so
barbarous  as to make either such a letter or such a certificate from
me either necessary or even pardonable  46  your hint  that i must
correct some things that are amiss  extorts from me an involuntary
sigh  i shall be in a situation critical and difficult without
example  my own character at stake from various quarters  and without
anything to support me but truth and innocence  and you need not be
informed  that these are not always sufficient  i have little
expectation of doing good  god grant i may do no harm  i shall not
designedly  but i suppose congress intend to examine me as a witness 
and i must tell the truth  the whole truth  and nothing but the truth 
as far as i know it  if the task should end here  i should not be much
embarrassed  but if they should proceed to demand of me opinions and
judgments of men and things  as there is reason to expect they will 
although i hope they will not  what will be the consequences  upon the
whole  truth must be my shield  and if the shafts of interested malice
can pierce through this  they shall pierce me 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

on the 27th of february  i had the honor of writing to congress 
informing them of my intention of returning home  in consequence of
the commission which superseded mine  on the first of march  i had
again the honor of writing some information concerning the
unprecedented interest  which the british government are obliged to
give for the loan of money for the service of the present year  on the
8th of march  i took my leave of the american minister  and left paris
for nantes  in expectation of there meeting the alliance  and sailing
in her for america in a few weeks  upon my arrival at nantes  i
learned the alliance was yet at brest  and so embarrassed with nearly
forty prisoners  who were supposed to have been concerned in a
conspiracy to carry her to england  and with other difficulties  that
it was uncertain when she would be ready 

the agent at nantes at this time receiving a letter from his
excellency  dr franklin  desiring him to consult me about the
direction of the alliance  i thought it would expedite the public
service for me to make a journey to brest  about two hundred miles 
which i undertook accordingly  and arrived at that port without loss
of time  there  after an attendance of some weeks  and much
negotiation with the commandant  intendant  and agent  all things were
prepared for the frigate to sail for nantes  with about one hundred
british prisoners  to be exchanged for a like number of american
prisoners  arrived there from england in a cartel  i returned to
nantes  and the alliance in a few days arrived in the river  the
prisoners were exchanged  about sixty enlisted in the alliance  and
the rest in the poor richard  captain jones 

after accommodating all the difficulties with the british prisoners 
the american prisoners  the officers and crew of the alliance  and
supplying all their necessary wants  captain landais  having orders to
sail for america  and everything ready to proceed to sea in a few
days  received unexpected orders to proceed to l orient  and wait
there for further orders  i had the honor of a letter at the same time
from his excellency  enclosing one from the minister of marine  by
which i learned  that the king had been graciously pleased to grant me
a passage on board the frigate  which was to carry his majesty s new
minister plenipotentiary to the united states  that the frigate was at
l orient  and that the minister would be there in a few days  i went
in the alliance from nantes to l orient  where after some time the
frigate  the sensible  arrived  but his excellency  the chevalier de
la luzerne  did not arrive until the 10th of june  on the 14th of
june  and not before  i had the pleasure to be under sail  and on the
3d of august  arrived in nantasket roads 

i have entered into this detail of disappointments to justify myself
for not returning sooner  and to shew that it was not my fault  that i
was not at home in eight weeks from the first authentic information 
that i had nothing further to do in france  there is nothing remaining
for me to do but to settle my accounts with congress  but as part of
my accounts are in conjunction with my late colleagues  with whom i
lived in the same house during my residence in paris  i am not able to
judge whether congress will choose to receive my accounts  or to wait
until the other commissioners shall exhibit theirs  and have the whole
together  under one view  so as to do equal justice to all  i am
ready  however  to render all the account in my power  either jointly
or separately  whenever congress shall order it  and i shall wait
their directions accordingly 

it is not in my power  having been so long from paris  to give
congress any news of importance  except that the brest fleet  under
the count d orvilliers  was at sea the beginning of june  that admiral
arbuthnot was at plymouth the 31st of may  and that there was a
universal persuasion  arising from letters from paris and london  that
spain had decided against the english  the chevalier de la luzerne
will be able to give congress satisfactory information upon this head 

i ought not to conclude this letter  without expressing my obligations
to captain chavagne  and the other officers of the sensible  for their
civilities in the course of my passage home  and the pleasure i have
had in the conversation of his excellency  the new minister
plenipotentiary from our august ally  and the secretary to the
embassy  monsieur marbois 

the chevalier de la luzerne is a knight of the order of st john of
jerusalem  of an ancient and noble family  connected by blood with
many characters of principal name in the kingdom  a grandson of the
celebrated chancellor de la moignon  a nephew of monsieur malesherbes 
perhaps still more famous as first president of the court of aids and
as a minister of state  a brother to the count de la luzerne  and of
the bishop of sangres  one of the three dukes and peers who had the
honor to assist in the consecration of the king  a near relation of
the marcéhal de broglie and the count his brother  and of many other
important personages in that country  nor is his personal character
less respectable than his connexions  as he is possessed of much
useful information of all kinds  and particularly of the political
system of europe  obtained in his late embassy in bavaria  and of the
justest sentiments of the mutual interests of his country and ours 
and of the utility to both of that alliance  which so happily unites
them  and at the same time divested of all personal and party
attachments and aversions  congress and their constituents  i flatter
myself  will have much satisfaction in his negotiations  as well as in
those of the secretary to the embassy  who was recently secretary to
the embassy in bavaria  and who is a counsellor of the parliament of
metz  a gentleman whose abilities  application  and disposition cannot
fail to make him useful in the momentous office he sustains 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect   c

  sir 

at the close of the service on which congress have done me the honor
to send me  it may not be amiss to submit a few remarks to their
consideration on the general state of affairs in europe  as far as
they relate to the interests of the united states  as the time
approaches  when our relations with the most considerable states in
europe will multiply and assume a greater stability  they deserve the
attention of americans in general  but especially of those composing
their supreme council 

france deserves the first place among those powers  with which our
connexions will be the most intimate  and it is with pleasure i am
able to assure congress  that from the observations i have made during
my residence in that kingdom  i have the strongest reasons to believe 
that their august ally  his ministers  and nation  are possessed of
the fullest persuasion of the justice of our cause  of the great
importance of our independence to their interests  and the firmest
resolution to preserve the faith of treaties inviolate  and to
cultivate our friendship with sincerity and zeal  this is of the more
consequence to us  as this power enjoys in europe at this hour an
influence  which it has not before experienced for many years 

men are so sensible of a constant tendency in others to excesses  that
a signal superiority of power never appears  without exciting
jealousies and efforts to reduce it  thus  when spain  under charles
the fifth and his successor  made herself dangerous  a great part of
europe united against her  assisted in severing the united provinces
from her  and by degrees greatly diminished her power  thus  when
france  under lewis the fourteenth  indulged the spirit of conquest
too far  a great part of mankind united their forces against her  with
such success as to involve her in a train of misfortunes  out of which
she never emerged before the present reign  the english  in their
turn  by means of their commerce and extensive settlements abroad 
arose to a degree of opulence and naval power  which excited more
extravagant passions in her own breast  and more tyrannical exertions
of her influence  than appeared in either of the other cases  the
consequence has been similar  but more remarkable  europe seems to be
more universally and sincerely united in the desire of reducing her 
than they ever were in any former instance  this is the true cause why
the french court never made war with so universal a popularity among
their own subjects  so general an approbation of other courts  and
such unanimous wishes among all nations for her success  as at this
time 

the personal character of the king  his declared patronage of morals
and economy  and the great strokes of wisdom  which have marked the
commencement of his reign  the active spring which has been given to
commerce by the division of the british empire  and our new connexions
with his subjects  all these causes  together with the two treaties of
peace  which have been lately signed under his auspices and his
mediation  have given to this power a reputation  which the last reign
had lost 

the first of these treaties has determined those controversies  which
had for a long time divided russia and the porte  and the parties have
been equally satisfied with the conditions of their reconciliation  a
circumstance the more honorable for the french ministry  and the
chevalier de st priest  their ambassador at constantinople  as it is
uncommon  the ancient confidence of the porte in the court of
versailles has revived  and the coolness  or rather enmity  which
divided france and russia for near twenty years  gives place to a
friendship  which is at this time in all its fervor  and will probably
be durable  as these powers have no interest to annoy each other  but 
on the contrary  are able to assist each other in a manner the most
essential 

the peace of germany  signed at teschin  the 13th of last may  has not
equally satisfied the belligerent powers  who were on the one part the
emperor  and on the other  the king of prussia and the elector of
saxony his ally 

from the multitudes of writings  which have appeared before and during
this war  in which the causes  the motives  and the rights of it are
discussed  it appears  that in 1768  at the extinction of one of the
branches of the house of bavaria  which has been separated from its
trunk for near five centuries  the house of austria thought itself
able  and priests and lawyers among their own subjects were
complaisant enough to tell her  that she had a right to put herself in
possession of the best part of the patrimony of the extinguished line 

the king of prussia  to whose interest this augmentation of power
would have been dangerous  has crowned an illustrious reign  by
displaying all the resources of military genius and profound policy in
opposition to it  while he contended in the field  france negotiated 
and the work  begun by his arms  was completed by the cabinet of
versailles 

the palatine house of bavaria  the duke of deux ponts  and
particularly the elector of saxony  have obtained all they could
reasonably demand  and the empire has preserved its balance of power
in spite of its head  the king of prussia had covered himself with
glory  to which he put the finishing stroke  by not demanding any
compensation for the expenses of the war  all parties have been
satisfied except the emperor  who has disordered his finances  ruined
his kingdom of bohemia with immense fines  has not obtained any
advantage over his adversary  and consequently has destroyed among his
own troops the opinion they had of their superiority  and  in fine 
has sustained a loss the most sensible for a young prince just
beginning to reign  the reputation of justice and moderation  it is
the influence  the address  and ability of the french minister  joined
to the firmness of russia  which have completed this work  and lewis
the sixteenth has restored in germany to the nation over which he
reigns  that reputation which his grandfather had lost 

the merit of the chevalier de la luzerne  who was ambassador in
bavaria during the transaction of this business  and that of m 
marbois  the secretary to that embassy  in accomplishing an affair of
such importance  which was rendered peculiarly delicate by the late
family connexion between the courts of vienna and versailles  was
probably a motive for sending them now to america  a mission of no
less importance and no less delicacy 

it is not probable  however  that they could have succeeded so soon 
if england could have afforded subsidies to the emperor  the
revolution in america  in which the french king has taken an earlier
and a greater part than any other sovereign in europe  has operated so
as to conciliate to him a consideration that is universal  the new
minister will give to congress information the most precise in this
respect  and touching the part which spain is taking at this time  for
which reason i shall refrain from entering into it  and content myself
with observing  that all these considerations ought to induce us to
cherish the alliance of france  and that every good citizen of the
united states ought to endeavor to destroy the remains of those
prejudices  which our ancient rulers have endeavored to inspire us
with  that we have nothing to fear and much to hope from france  while
we conduct ourselves with good sense and firmness  and that we cannot
take too much pains to multiply the commercial relations  and
strengthen the political connexions between the two nations  provided
always  that we preserve prudence and resolution enough to receive
implicitly no advice whatever  but to judge always for ourselves  and
to guard ourselves against those principles in government  and those
manners  which are so opposite to our own constitution and to our own
characters  as a young people  called by providence to the most
honorable and important of all duties  that of forming establishments
for a great nation and a new world 

in the opinion of some  the power with which we shall one day have a
relation the most immediate  next to that of france  is great britain 
but it ought to be considered  that this power loses every day her
consideration  and runs towards her ruin  her riches  in which her
power consisted  she has lost with us  and never can regain  with us
she has lost her mediterranean trade  her african trade  her german
and holland trade  her ally  portugal  her ally  russia  and her
natural ally  the house of austria  at least  as being unable to
protect these as she once did  she can obtain no succor from them  in
short  one branch of commerce has been lopped off after another  and
one political interest sacrificed after another  she resembles the
melancholy spectacle of a great wide spreading tree  that has been
girded at the root  her endeavors to regain these advantages  will
continually keep alive in her breast the most malevolent passions
towards us  her envy  her jealousy  and resentment  will never leave
us  while we are what we must unavoidably be  her rivals in the
fisheries  in various other branches of commerce  and even in naval
power  if peace should unhappily be made  leaving canada  nova scotia 
or the floridas  or any of them  in her hands  jealousies and
controversies will be perpetually arising  the degree  therefore  of
intercourse with this nation  which will ever again take place  may
justly be considered as problematical  or rather the probability is 
that it will never be so great as some persons imagine  moreover  i
think that every citizen in the present circumstances  who respects
his country  and the engagements she has taken  ought to abstain from
the foresight of a return of friendship between us and the english 
and act as if it never was to be 

but it is lawful to consider  that which will probably be formed
between the hollanders and us  the similitude of manners  of religion 
and in some respects of constitution  the analogy between the means by
which the two republics arrived at independency  but above all the
attractions of commercial interest  will infallibly draw them
together  this connexion will not probably show itself  before a peace
or a near prospect of peace  too many motives of fear or interest
place the hollanders in a dependance on england  to suffer her to
connect herself openly with us at present  nevertheless  if the king
of prussia  could be induced to take us by the hand  his great
influence in the united provinces might contribute greatly to
conciliate their friendship for us  loans of money  and the operations
of commercial agents or societies  will be the first threads of our
connexions with this power  from the essays and inquiries of your
commissioners at paris  it appears  that some money may be borrowed
there  and from the success of several enterprises by the way of st
eustatia  it seems that the trade between the two countries is likely
to increase  and possibly congress may think it expedient to send a
minister there  if they should  it will be proper to give him a
discretionary power to produce his commission or not  as he shall find
it likely to succeed  to give him full powers and clear instructions
concerning the borrowing of money  and the man himself above all
should have consummate prudence  and a caution and discretion  that
will be proof against every trial 

if congress could find any means of paying the interest annually in
europe  commercial and pecuniary connexions would strengthen
themselves from day to day  and if the fall of the credit of england
should terminate in bankruptcy  the seven united provinces  having
nothing to dissemble  would be zealous for a part of those rich
benefits  which our commerce offers to the maritime powers  and by an
early treaty with us secure those advantages  from which they have
already discovered strong symptoms of a fear of being excluded by
delays  it is scarcely necessary to observe to congress  that holland
has lost her influence in europe to such a degree  that there is
little other regard for her remaining but that of a prodigal heir for
a rich usurer  who lends him money at a high interest  the state
which is poor and in debt has no political stability  their army is
very small  and their navy is less  the immense riches of individuals
may possibly be in some future time the great misfortune of the
nation  because the means of defence are not proportioned to the
temptation which is held out for some necessitous  avaricious  and
formidable neighbor to invade her 

the active commerce of spain is very inconsiderable  of her passive
commerce  we shall not fail to have a part  the vicinity of this
power  her forces  her resources  ought to make us attentive to her
conduct  but if we may judge of the future by the past  i should hope
we had nothing to fear from it  the genius and interest of the nation
incline it to repose  she cannot determine upon war but in the last
extremity  and even then she sighs for peace  she is not possessed of
the spirit of conquest  and we have reason to congratulate ourselves 
that we have her for the nearest and principal neighbor  her conduct
towards us at this time will perhaps appear equivocal and indecisive 
her determinations appear to be solely the fruit of the negotiations
of the court of versailles  but it ought to be considered  she has not
had motives so pressing as those of france to take in hand our
defence  whether she has an eye upon the floridas  or what other terms
she may expect from congress  they are no doubt better informed than i
am  to their wisdom it must be submitted to give her satisfaction  if
her terms are moderate  and her offers in proportion  this conduct may
conciliate her affection and shorten delays  a point of great
importance  as the present moment appears to be decisive 

portugal  under the administration of the marquis de pombal  broke
some of the shackles by which she was held to england  but the
treaty  by which a permanent friendship is established between the
crowns of spain and portugal  was made in 1777  an event that the
english deplore as the greatest evil  next to the irrecoverable loss
of the colonies  arising from this war  because they will now no
longer be able to play off portugal against spain  in order to draw
away her attention as well as her forces  as in former times  but as
portugal has not known how to deliver herself entirely from the
influence of england  we shall have little to hope from her  on the
other hand  such is her internal weakness  that we have absolutely
nothing to fear  we shall necessarily have commerce with her  but
whether she will ever have the courage to sacrifice the friendship of
england for the sake of it is uncertain 

it would be useless to consider that infinite number of little
sovereignties into which germany is divided  and develope all their
political interests  this task is as much beyond my knowledge as it
would be useless to congress  they will have few relations friendly or
hostile with this country  excepting in two branches of commerce  that
of merchandise and that of soldiers  the latter  infamous and
detestable as it is  has been established between a nation  once
generous  humane  and brave  and certain princes  as avaricious of
money as they are prodigal of the blood of their subjects  and such is
the scarcity of cash  and the avidity for it in germany  and so little
are the rights of humanity understood and respected  that sellers will
probably be found as long as buyers  america will never be found in
either class  the state of germany  with which we may have commerce of
an honorable kind  is the house of austria  one of the most powerful
in europe  she possesses very few countries  however  near the sea 
ostend is the principal city  where she might have established a trade
of some consequence  if the jealousy of the maritime powers had not
constantly opposed it  france  spain  holland  and england  have been
all agreed in their opposition  and the treaty of utrecht  ratified
more than once by subsequent treaties  has so shackled this port  that
it will be impossible to open a direct trade to it  without some new
treaty  which possibly may not be very distant  england may possibly
make a new treaty with austria  and agree to privileges for this port 
in order to draw away the advantages of the american trade from france
and spain  and in such a treaty holland may possibly acquiesce  if not
accede to it  the port of trieste enjoys liberty without limits  and
the court of vienna is anxious to make its commerce flourish  situated
as it is at the bottom of the gulf of trieste  the remotest part of
the gulf of venice  tedious and difficult as the navigation of those
seas is  we could make little use of it at any time  and none at all
while this war continues 

this court would seize with eagerness the advantages  that are
presented to her by the independence of america  but an interest more
powerful restrains her  and although she is certainly attentive to
this revolution  there is reason to believe she will be one of the
last powers to acknowledge our independence  she is so far from being
rich  that she is destitute of the means of making war without
subsidies  as is proved by the peace which has lately been made  she
has occasion for the succors of france or of england to put in motion
her numerous armies  she conceives easily  that the loss of the
resources and credit of the english has disabled them to pay the
enormous subsidies  which  in former times  they have poured into the
austrian coffers  she sees therefore with a secret mortification  that
she shall be hereafter more at the mercy of france  who may choose her
ally  and prefer at her pleasure either austria or prussia  while
neither vienna nor berlin will be able  as in times past  to choose
between paris and london  since the latter has lost her past opulence
and pecuniary resources  it is our duty to remark these great changes
in the system of mankind  which have already happened in consequence
of the american war  the alienation of portugal from england  the
peace of germany  and that between petersburg and constantinople  by
all which events england has lost  and france gained  such a
superiority of influence and power  are owing entirely to the blind
division of that policy and wealth  which the english might have still
enjoyed  from the objects of their true interests and honor  to the
ruinous american war 

the court of berlin flatters itself  that the connexions which have
heretofore so long united france and prussia will renew themselves
sooner or later  this system is more rational than that which subsists
at this day  the king of prussia may then wait without anxiety the
consequences of the present revolution  because it tends to increase
the resources of his natural ally  the jealousy between the emperor
and the king of prussia  and that between the houses of bourbon and
austria  are a natural tie between france and prussia  the rivalry
between france and great britain is another motive  too natural and
too permanent for the former to suffer the king of prussia to be long
the ally of the latter  one of the favorite projects of prussia  that
of rendering the port of emden a place of flourishing trade  interests
him most powerfully in our independence  silesia  one of his best
provinces  has already felt the influence of it  and  sensible of the
force that empires derive from commerce  he is earnestly desirous to
see it introduced between america and his states  which gives ground
to believe  that as austria will be one of the last so prussia will be
one of the first to acknowledge our independence  an opinion which is
rendered more probable by the answer  which was given by the baron de
schulenburg to mr arthur lee  and the influence of the king of prussia
in the united provinces  which is greater than that of any other
power  arising from his great military force  and the vicinity of his
dominions  his near relation to the stadtholder and the prince of
brunswick  is an additional motive to cultivate his friendship  the
electorate of saxony  with a fruitful soil  contains a numerous and
industrious people  and most of the commerce between the east and the
west of europe passes through it  the fairs of leipsic have drawn
considerable advantages for these four years from our trade  this
power will see with pleasure the moment  which shall put the last hand
to our independence  the rest of germany  excepting hamburgh and
bremen  have no means of opening a direct commerce with us  with the
latter we have no connexion at present  in the former all the commerce
of lower germany is transacted  here we shall soon have occasion to
establish an agent or consul 

poland  depopulated by the war and a vicious government  reduced by a
shameful treaty to two thirds of her ancient dominion  destitute of
industry and manufactures  even of the first necessity  has no
occasion for the productions of america  dantzic sees her ancient
prosperity diminish every day  there is  therefore  little probability
of commerce  and less of any political connexion between that nation
and us 

russia  sweden  and denmark  comprehended under the denomination of
the northern powers  have been thought by some to be interested in our
return to the domination of great britain  whether they consider
themselves in this light or not  their late declarations against the
right of england to interrupt their navigation  and their arming for
the protection of their commerce on the ocean  and even in the english
channel  are unequivocal proofs of their opinion concerning the right
in our contest  and of their intentions not to interfere against us 
it is very true  that the articles of commerce which they produce  are
in many respects the same with those of america  yet if we consider
that we shall have occasion to purchase from them large quantities of
hemp and sailcloth  and that our productions of timber  pitch  tar 
and turpentine  are less profitable with us without bounties  than
some other branches of labor  it is not probable that we shall lower
the price of these articles in europe so much as some conjecture  and
consequently our increased demand upon those countries for several
articles will be more than a compensation to them for the small loss
they may sustain  by a trifling reduction in the price of those
articles  it is not probable that the courts of petersburg  stockholm 
and copenhagen have viewed with indifference the present revolution 
if they have been apprehensive of being hurt by it in some respects 
which however i think must have been a mistaken apprehension  yet the
motive of humbling the pride of the english  who have endeavored to
exercise their domination  even over the northern seas  and to render
the danish and swedish flag dependent on theirs  has prevailed over
all others  and they are considered in europe as having given their
testimony against the english in this war 

italy  a country which declines every day from its ancient prosperity 
offers few objects to our speculations  the privileges of the port of
leghorn  nevertheless  may render it useful to our ships  when our
independence shall be acknowledged by great britain  if  as we once
flattered ourselves  the court of vienna might receive an american
minister  we were equally in error respecting the court of the grand
duchy of tuscany  where an austrian prince reigns  who receives all
his directions from vienna  in such a manner that he will probably
never receive any person in a public character  until the chief of his
house has set him the example  the king of the two sicilies is in the
same dependence on the court of madrid  and we may depend upon it  he
will conform himself to all it shall suggest to him  this prince has
already ordered the ports of his dominions to be open to american
vessels  public and private  and has ordered his ambassador at paris
to apply to your commissioners for a description of the american flag 
that our vessels might be known  and receive no molestation upon their
appearance in his harbors 

the court of rome  attached to ancient customs  would be one of the
last to acknowledge our independence  if we were to solicit for it 
but congress will probably never send a minister to his holiness  who
can do them no service  upon condition of receiving a catholic legate
or nuncio in return  or in other words  an ecclesiastical tyrant 
which it is to be hoped the united states will be too wise ever to
admit into their territories 

the states of the king of sardinia are poor  and their commerce is
very small  the little port of villa franca will probably see few
american vessels  nor will there be any close relations  either
commercial or political  between this prince and us 

the republic of genoa is scarcely known at this day in europe  but by
those powers who borrow money  it is possible that some small sums
might be obtained there  if congress would fall upon means of insuring
a punctual payment of interest in europe 

venice  heretofore so powerful  is reduced to a very inconsiderable
commerce  and is in an entire state of decay 

switzerland is another lender of money  but neither her position nor
her commerce can occasion any near relation with us 

whether there is anything in these remarks worth the trouble of
reading  i shall submit to the wisdom of congress  and subscribe
myself  with the highest consideration  your most obedient and humble
servant

  my dear sir 

since i have had opportunity to converse a little in this country  and
to read a few gazettes  i find that questions have been agitated here
in the newspapers  and in private circles  as well as in congress 
concerning his excellency  the count de vergennes  and mr arthur lee 
which seem to make it necessary that i should send the enclosed
copies  47  you can judge better than i whether it will be of any
public utility to lay them before congress  my first letter  and his
excellency s answer  i can see no objection to laying before
congress  but as the rest 48  contain little else besides mutual
compliments  perhaps it will be as well to conceal them  i submit the
whole  however  to your discretion  and am  with much esteem   c

  sir 

looking over the printed journals of the 15th of last april  i find in
the report of the committee appointed to take into consideration the
foreign affairs of the united states  and also the conduct of the late
and present commissioners of these states  the two following articles 

1   that it appears to them  that dr franklin is plenipotentiary for
these states at the court of france  dr arthur lee  commissioner for
the court of spain  mr william lee  commissioner for the courts of
vienna and berlin  mr ralph izard  commissioner for the court of
tuscany  that mr john adams was appointed one of the commissioners at
the court of france  in the place of mr deane  who had been appointed
a joint commissioner with dr franklin and dr arthur lee  but that the
said commission of mr adams is superseded by the plenipotentiary
commission to dr franklin 

2   that in the course of their examination and inquiry  they find
many complaints against the said commissioners  and the political and
commercial agency of mr deane  which complaints  with the evidence in
support thereof  are herewith delivered  and to which the committee
beg leave to refer  

the word  said  in the second article  refers to the commissioners
mentioned in the first  and as my name is among them  i learn from
hence  that there were some complaints against me  and that the
evidence in support of them was delivered to congress by the
committee 

i therefore pray  that i may be favored with copies of those
complaints  evidences  and the names of my accusers  and the witnesses
against me  that i may take such measures as may be in my power to
justify myself to congress 

i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i had yesterday the honor of your letter of the 7th of this month  i
thank you  sir  for your obliging congratulations on my return to my
family and country 

the reason why my letters of the 27th of february  and the 1st of
march  arrived so late was  that they were delivered at the time of
their dates to gentlemen then bound to the seaports  who expected to
sail directly for america  but were disappointed of passages  until
the vessels sailed under the convoy of the sensible 

i have not my letter book here  but i do not remember that they
contained anything of much consequence  so that i suppose the
inconvenience of their late arrival was not much 

you will be pleased to make my most respectful compliments to the
members of congress  and believe me  with great esteem   c

  my dear sir 

what shall i say to your favors of the 27th and 28th of september 
which came by the last post  the unanimity of my election surprises
me  as much as the delicacy  importance  and danger of the trust
distress me  the appointment of mr dana to be secretary pleases me
more than my own to be minister  commissioner  negotiator  call it
what you will  i have communicated to him your letters in confidence 
and all other material intelligence i had  and hope he will not
decline  but you know the peculiarities of his situation  and if he
should refuse  i hope you will not force your name out of nomination
again  i did not suppose that such characters would be willing to go
as secretaries  because i did not know your plan  otherwise i should
not have mentioned mr jennings to mr gerry for one to dr franklin 
your mastery of the language  and your indefatigability  would make
you infinitely useful in any of these departments 

i rejoice that you produced my letter to the count de vergennes and
his answer before the choice  because it contained a testimony in
favor of mr lee  which was his due  49  i am very much affected at his
recall  because i know his merit  and  therefore  i am glad i was not
placed in his stead  for suspicions would have arisen  and
reflections would have been cast upon me  as having favored his
removal in order to make room  which i certainly did not  i am
infinitely obliged to you for those letters  and for that received the
post before last  but i really tremble for your health  let me entreat
you  for the sake of our country  to take care of it  if i was to
apply myself as you do  i should soon go to study politics in another
sphere  yet i am so selfish as to beg the continuance of your favors
to me  and i pledge myself to you  i will not be in debt any more than
may be made by the intrinsic difference in the value of the letters 
which will be unavoidable 

i thank you for the extract from mr izard s letter  i am not a little
surprised at its contents  it was written  i see  to his friend  and i
suppose intended in confidence  i am fully persuaded he did not
intend  that the whole should have been laid before congress  50  i
utterly deny that i ever used to him any such language  as the
indecent paragraph that closes what he says about me  indeed  that is
manifestly his own inference  and in his own words  from what he says
he had heard me say  and he draws the same from what dr franklin and
mr deane had said upon the same subject  i further deny that i ever
_threatened_ him with the displeasure of congress  for writing his
opinion concerning these articles to congress  or for suggesting them
to the commissioners  but to enter into all the conversations that
have passed between mr izard and me respecting those articles  and
many other points in order to give a full and fair representation of
those conversations  would fill a small volume  yet there never was
any angry or rude conversation between him and me  that i can
recollect  i lived with him on good terms  visited him and he me 
dined with his family  and his family with me  and i ever told him 
and repeated it often  that i should be always obliged to him for his
advice  opinions  and sentiments upon any american subject  and that i
should always give it its due weight  although i did not think myself
bound to follow it any further than it seemed to me to be just  as
congress have declined giving me the charges against me by their
authority  and have  upon the whole  acquitted me with so much
splendor  it would look like a littleness of soul in me to make myself
anxious  or give them any further trouble about it  and as i have in
general so good an opinion of mr izard s attachment to his country 
and of his honor  i shall not think myself bound to take any further
notice of this fruit of his inexperience in public life  this peevish
ebullition of the rashness of his temper  i have written a few other
observations to mr gerry on the same subject  you and he will compare
these with them for your private satisfaction  but be sure that they
are not exposed where they will do harm to the public  to mr izard  or
me  unnecessarily 

if i should go abroad  cannot you lend me twenty or thirty complete
sets of the journals  they are much wanted in europe  a set of them is
a genteel present  and perhaps would do me and the public more service
than you are aware of  if congress  or some committee would order it 
i should be very glad 

  i am   c

  sir 

i had in paris an opportunity of procuring information concerning the
british whale fishery on the coast of brazil  which it is proper to
communicate to congress  that if any advantage can be made of it the
opportunity may not be lost 

the last year and the year before the english carried on this fishery
to very great advantage  off the river plate in south america  in the
latitude of 35° south  and from thence to 40°  just on the edge of
soundings  off and on  as the sailors express it  and about longitude
65° from london  they had about seventeen vessels in this fishery 
which all sailed from london in the months of september and october 
all the officers and men americans from nantucket and cape cod  two or
three from rhode island  and one from long island  four or five of
these vessels went to greenland  to which place they sail yearly  the
last of february or the beginning of march 

the year before last  there was published in the english newspapers  a
letter from the lords of the admiralty to dennis de bredt  in coleman
street  informing him  that a convoy should be appointed to the brazil
fleet  but this i had certain information was a forgery  calculated
merely to deceive american privateers  and no convoy actually went or
was appointed  either last year or the year before  although the
imposture was repeated both times  and will no doubt be renewed this 

for the capture or destruction of a fishery so wholly defenceless  not
one of the vessels having any arms  a single frigate  or indeed a
privateer of four and twenty guns  would be sufficient  the beginning
of december would be the best time to proceed from boston or
philadelphia  because the frigate would then find the whaling vessels
nearly loaded  the cargoes of bone and oil are very valuable  and at
least four hundred and fifty of the best kind of seamen would be taken
out of the hands of the english  and might be gained into the american
service  most of the officers and men wish well to this country  and
would gladly be in its service  if they could be delivered from that
they are engaged in  whenever the english men of war or privateers 
have taken an american vessel  they have given to all the whalemen
found among the crew  by order of government  their choice  either to
go on board a man of war and fight against their country  or into the
whale fishery  such numbers have chosen the latter  as have made up
the crews of seventeen vessels 

i thought it my duty to communicate this  that if so profitable a
branch of commerce  and so valuable a nursery of seamen  can be taken
from the english  it may be done  i prevailed with my colleagues last
year to represent these facts to his excellency  m  de sartine  but it
appears that his majesty s service would not admit of any enterprise
from france in consequence of it  since my return i have represented
them to the council of this state  but whether anything can be done by
them  after the disaster at penobscot  i doubt  if congress should not
deem it consistent with the public service to send a frigate upon this
service  nothing will be lost but the trouble of this letter 

i have the honor to congratulate your excellency on your advancement
to the chair  and to subscribe myself with great respect   c

  sir 

m  schweighauser of nantes  who is a native of switzerland  observing
me as i was one day at his house looking with some attention upon a
stamp of the heroic deed of william tell  asked me to take a few of
them to america  as a present from him  which i agreed to do with
pleasure  he accordingly sent on board the frigate a box containing 
as he told me  one stamp for each state  neatly framed and glazed 
which he desired me to present to congress  as a small token of his
respect  the box has never been opened  but i hope the pictures are
safe  and with permission of congress i will deliver it to the navy
board in boston  to be by them transmitted to the delegates from the
several states  or to their order

  sir 

so many advantages might be derived to the united states in the
conduct of the war  in furnishing the army and navy  in augmenting the
value  or at least in preventing the further depreciation of their
currency  in lowering the prices of goods  in supplying the wants of
the people  and in preventing murmurs and discontents  that i have
ever thought it of very great importance  in some way or other  to
procure convoys to their trade  to and from the west india islands 
and europe 

france and spain have such advantages of england in carrying on the
war in the american seas  and would receive such assistance from our
commerce  privateers  and growing navy  that i have ever thought it a
main principle of their policy to maintain a constant and decided
superiority of naval power in the west indies  and upon the coasts of
this continent  i would  therefore  with due deference to the superior
wisdom of congress  beg leave to submit to their consideration 
whether it would not be expedient for them  either by a direct
representation from themselves to the french and spanish courts  or by
instructions to their plenipotentiary ministers  to convince those
courts  that their true interest lies in adopting this plan  it is
certainly their interest  reasoning upon french and spanish principles
simply  to conduct this war in such a manner as has a tendency in the
shortest time  and with the least expense  to diminish the power of
their enemies  and increase their own  now i would submit it to
congress whether it may not be easily demonstrated  that these ends
may be obtained the most easily in this way  a representation from
congress  either directly or by instructions to their ministers 
showing what assistance in provisions  artists  materials  vessels of
war  privateers  land armies  or in any other way  france and spain
might depend upon receiving from these states  either for money or as
the exertions of an ally  would have great weight 

much has been already said to the french ministry upon these subjects 
and not wholly without effect  yet much more may be said to greater
advantage  and perhaps to better purpose  for they are extremely well
disposed to do what can be made to appear to them for the advantage of
the common cause 

i have the honor to enclose some papers on this subject  one is a
letter from the commissioners to his excellency the count de
vergennes  which he received the beginning of january last  51  the
other is a letter from me to the marquis de lafayette 52  in february 
with his answer 

  i have the honor to be   c

  my dear sir 

your favor of the 4th of this month gave me great pleasure  but i am
afraid that you and some others of my friends felt more for me in the
awkward situation you mention than i did for myself  though i cannot
say that i was wholly insensible  i could compare it to nothing  but
shakspeare s idea of ariel  wedged in the middle of a rifted oak  for
i was sufficiently sensible  that it was owing to an unhappy division
in congress  and pains enough were taken to inform me  that one side
were for sending me to spain  and the other to holland  so that i was
flattered to find that neither side had any decisive objection against
trusting me  and that the apparent question was only _where_ 

that i was sent without the least solicitation of mine  directly or
indirectly  is certainly true  and i had such formidable ideas of the
sea and of british men of war  such diffidence in my own
qualifications to do service in that way  and such uncertainty of the
reception i should meet  that i had little inclination to adventure 
that i went against my interest is most undoubtedly so  for i never
yet served the public without losing by it  i was not  however  as you
suppose  kept unemployed  i had business enough to do  as i could
easily convince you  there is a great field of business there  and i
could easily show you that i did my share of it  there is so much to
do  and so much difficulty to do it well  that i am rejoiced to find a
gentleman of such abilities  principles  and activity as colonel
laurens undoubtedly is  without a compliment  appointed to assist in
it  53  i most sincerely hope for his friendship  and an entire
harmony with him  for which reason i should be very happy in his
company in the passage  or in an interview with him as soon as
possible in europe  he will be in a delicate situation  but not so
much so as i was  and plain sense  honest intentions  and common
civility will  i think  be sufficient to secure him  and do much good 

your kind compliments on my safe return and most honorable re election
are very obliging  i have received no commission  nor instructions 
nor any particular information of the plan  but from the advice and
information from you and several other of my friends at philadelphia
and here  i shall make no hesitation to say  that  notwithstanding the
delicacy and danger of this commission  i suppose i shall accept it
without delay and trust events to heaven  as i have been long used to
do 

the convulsions at philadelphia are very affecting and alarming  but
not entirely unexpected to me  the state of parties  and the nature of
their government  have a long time given me disagreeable
apprehensions  but i hope they will find some remedy  methods will be
found to feed the army  but i know of none to clothe it without
convoys to trade  which congress  i think  will do well to undertake 
and persuade france and spain to undertake as soon as possible  your
packets for your friends in europe will give me pleasure  and shall be
forwarded with care and despatch 

  with great truth and regard  i am   c

  sir 

i had yesterday the honor of receiving your letter of the 20th of
october  enclosed with two commissions  appointing me minister
plenipotentiary from the united states  to negotiate peace and
commerce with great britain  together with instructions for my
government in the execution of these commissions  copies of
instructions to the ministers plenipotentiary at versailles and
madrid  and two acts of congress of the 4th and 15th of october 

peace is an object of such vast importance  the interests to be
adjusted in the negotiations to obtain it are so complicated and so
delicate  and the difficulty of giving even general satisfaction is so
great  that i feel myself more distressed at the prospect of executing
the trust  than at the thought of leaving my country  and again
encountering the dangers of the seas and of enemies  yet  when i
reflect on the general voice in my favor  and the high honor that is
done me by this appointment  i feel the warmest sentiments of
gratitude to congress  and shall make no hesitation to accept it  and
devote myself without reserve or loss of time to the discharge of it 
my success  however  may depend  in a very great degree  on the
intelligence and advices that i may receive from time to time from
congress  and on the punctuality with which several articles in my
instructions may be kept secret  it shall be my most earnest endeavor
to transmit to congress the most constant and exact information in my
power of whatever may occur  and to conceal those instructions  which
depend in any measure on my judgment  and i hope i need not suggest to
congress the necessity of communicating to me  as early as possible 
their commands from time to time  and of keeping all the discretionary
articles an impenetrable secret  a suggestion  however  that the
constitution of that sovereignty  which i have the honor to represent 
might excuse 

as the frigate has been some time waiting  i shall embark in eight or
ten days at furthest  your excellency will please to present my most
dutiful respects to congress  and accept my thanks for the polite and
obliging manner in which you have communicated their commands 

  i have the honor to be   c

      instructions for a treaty of peace with great britain  54 

footnote 

   54  these instructions  and those for a treaty of commerce which
  follow were agreed to unanimously in congress on the 14th of august 
  nearly six weeks before the minister was chosen  they were drawn up by
  gouverneur morris 

sir 

you will herewith receive a commission  giving you full power to
negotiate a treaty of peace with great britain  in doing which you
will conform to the following information and instructions 

1  the united states are sincerely desirous of peace  and wish by
every means  consistent with their dignity and safety  to spare the
further effusion of blood  they have  therefore  by your commission
and these instructions  labored to remove the obstacles to that event 
before the enemy have evidenced their disposition for it  but as the
great object of the present defensive war  on the part of the allies 
is to establish the independence of the united states  and as any
treaty whereby this end cannot be obtained must be only ostensible and
illusory  you are  therefore  to make it a preliminary article to any
negotiation  that great britain shall agree to treat with the united
states  as sovereign  free  and independent 

2  you shall take especial care also  that the independence of the
said states be effectually assured and confirmed by the treaty or
treaties of peace  according to the form and effect of the treaty of
alliance with his most christian majesty  and you shall not agree to
such treaty or treaties  unless the same be thereby so assured and
confirmed 

3  the boundaries of these states are as follows  viz  these states
are bounded north  by a line to be drawn from the northwest angle of
nova scotia along the highlands  which divide those rivers which empty
themselves into the river st lawrence  from those which fall into the
atlantic ocean  to the northwesternmost head of connecticut river 
thence down along the middle of that river to the fortyfifth degree of
north latitude  thence due west in the latitude fortyfive degrees
north from the equator to the northwesternmost side of the river st
lawrence or cadaraqui  thence straight to the south end of nepissing 
and thence straight to the source of the river mississippi  west  by a
line to be drawn along the middle of the river mississippi from its
source to where the said line shall intersect the thirtyfirst degree
of north latitude  south  by a line to be drawn due east  from the
termination of the line last mentioned in the latitude of thirtyone
degrees north from the equator to the middle of the river
appalachicola  or catahouchi  thence along the middle thereof to its
junction with the flint river  thence straight to the head of st
mary s river  and thence down along the middle of st mary s river to
the atlantic ocean  and east  by a line to be drawn along the middle
of st john s river from its source to its mouth in the bay of fundy 
comprehending all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the
shores of the united states  and lying between lines to be drawn due
east from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between nova
scotia on the one part  and east florida on the other part  shall
respectively touch the bay of fundy and the atlantic ocean  you are 
therefore  strongly to contend that the whole of the said countries
and islands lying within the boundaries aforesaid  and every citadel 
fort  post  place  harbor  and road to them belonging  be absolutely
evacuated by the land and sea forces of his britannic majesty  and
yielded to the powers of the states to which they respectively belong 
in such situation as they may be at the termination of the war  but 
notwithstanding the clear right of these states  and the importance of
the object  yet they are so much influenced by the dictates of
religion and humanity  and so desirous of complying with the earnest
request of their allies  that if the line to be drawn from the mouth
of the lake nepissing to the head of the mississippi cannot be
obtained without continuing the war for that purpose  you are hereby
empowered to agree to some other line between that point and the river
mississippi  provided the same shall in no part thereof be to the
southward of latitude fortyfive degrees north  and in like manner  if
the eastern boundary above described cannot be obtained  you are
hereby empowered to agree  that the same shall be afterwards adjusted 
by commissioners to be duly appointed for that purpose  according to
such line as shall be by them settled and agreed on  as the boundary
between that part of the state of massachusetts bay  formerly called
the province of maine  and the colony of nova scotia  agreeably to
their respective rights  and you may also consent  that the enemy
shall destroy such fortifications as they may have erected 

3  although it is of the utmost importance to the peace and commerce
of the united states that canada and nova scotia should be ceded  and
more particularly that their equal common right to the fisheries
should be guarantied to them  yet a desire of terminating the war has
induced us not to make the acquisition of these objects an ultimatum
on the present occasion 

5  you are empowered to agree to a cessation of hostilities during the
negotiation  provided our ally shall consent to the same  and provided
it shall be stipulated that all the forces of the enemy shall be
immediately withdrawn from the united states 

6  in all other matters not abovementioned  you are to govern yourself
by the alliance between his most christian majesty and these states 
by the advice of our allies  by your knowledge of our interests  and
by your own discretion  in which we repose the fullest confidence 

                                                   

        instructions for a treaty of commerce with great britain 

sir 

you will herewith receive a commission  giving you full power to
negotiate a treaty of commerce with great britain  in doing which  you
will consider yourself bound by the following information and
instructions 

1  you will govern yourself principally by the treaty of commerce with
his most christian majesty  and as  on the one hand  you shall grant
no privilege to great britain not granted by that treaty to france 
so  on the other  you shall not consent to any peculiar restrictions
or limitations whatever in favor of great britain 

2  in order that you may be the better able to act with propriety on
this occasion  it is necessary for you to know  that we have
determined  1st  that the common right of fishing shall in no case be
given up  2dly  that it is essential to the welfare of all these
united states that the inhabitants thereof  at the expiration of the
war  should continue to enjoy the free and undisturbed exercise of
their common right to fish on the banks of newfoundland  and the
other fishing banks and seas of north america  preserving inviolate
the treaties between france and the said states  3dly  that
application shall be made to his most christian majesty to agree to
some article or articles for the better securing to these states a
share in the said fisheries  4thly  that if  after a treaty of peace
with great britain  she shall molest the citizens or inhabitants of
any of the united states  in taking fish on the banks and places
hereinafter described  such molestation  being in our opinion a direct
violation and breach of the peace  shall be a common cause of the said
states  and the force of the union be exerted to obtain redress for
the parties injured  and 5thly  that our faith be pledged to the
several states  that  without their unanimous consent  no treaty of
commerce shall be entered into  nor any trade or commerce carried on
with great britain  without the explicit stipulation hereinafter
mentioned  you are therefore not to consent to any treaty of commerce
with great britain without an explicit stipulation on her part  not to
molest or disturb the inhabitants of the united states of america in
taking fish on the banks of newfoundland and other fisheries in the
american seas anywhere  excepting within the distance of three leagues
of the shores of the territories remaining to great britain at the
close of the war  if a nearer distance cannot be obtained by
negotiation  and in the negotiation you are to exert your most
strenuous endeavors to obtain a nearer distance to the gulf of st
lawrence  and particularly along the shores of nova scotia  as to
which latter we are desirous that even the shores may be occasionally
used for the purpose of carrying on the fisheries by the inhabitants
of these states 

in all matters you are to govern yourself by your own discretion  as
shall be most for the interest of these states  taking care that the
said treaty be founded on principles of equality and reciprocity  so
as to conduce to the mutual advantage of both nations  but not to the
exclusion of others

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress a copy of the letter book of
the commissioners at the court of versailles  during the time i had
the honor to be one of them  as the letter book was kept by me  and
almost wholly in my hand writing  the minister plenipotentiary
consented  that i should bring it home with me  leaving him a copy 
which was done 

as there may be many things in it which congress may have occasion to
know  i have prevailed with mr thaxter to copy it  i shall submit to
the consideration of congress  whether he ought to have any allowance
for this service  and how much  as mr thaxter will accompany me to
europe  in the character of my private secretary  if congress think
proper to allow him anything for these copies  i can pay him in europe
if it is thought proper 

i chose to mention mr thaxter s going with me to congress  because
jealousies have arisen heretofore concerning private secretaries  mr
thaxter is known to congress  and i think i can safely confide in his
fidelity  diligence  and discretion  and from the experience i have
had in europe i am fully convinced  that it is my duty to take with me
some one of this character 

i have the honor to be  with great respect   c

  sir 

i have the honor to inform your excellency  that  congress having
judged it proper to appoint me to a new mission in europe  i embarked
on the 13th of november  at the instance of the chevalier de la
luzerne and m  gerard  on board the same frigate  that carried me to
america  soon after we got to sea  a formidable leak in the ship
discovered itself  so as to oblige us to keep two pumps constantly
going by night and day  which induced the captain to think it
necessary to put into this place  where we have just now cast anchor 
whether i shall go to paris by land or wait for the frigate is
uncertain  i believe the former  as the latter might detain me four or
five weeks  i have despatches for your excellency from congress  which
i shall carry with me  and newspapers  these latter contain little
remarkable save the evacuation of rhode island by the enemy  and the
count d estaing s progress in georgia  in co operation with general
lincoln  which was in a fair course of success 

i hope the confederacy  which sailed from philadelphia three or four
weeks before us  with m  gerard and mr jay  who is appointed minister
plenipotentiary for spain  has happily arrived  and made it
unnecessary for me to enlarge upon the general state of affairs in
america  which were upon the whole in a favorable train  i hope to
have the honor of saluting you at passy in a few weeks  and am  with
great respect  sir  your most obedient humble servant

                                          ferrol  december 11th  1779 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that on the 13th of november i
embarked on board the french frigate  la sensible  and on the 14th
came on board mr francis dana  the secretary to my commission  when we
fell down to king s roads  and on the 15th we sailed for france 

a leak was soon discovered in the ship  which obliged us to ply the
pumps  as it seemed a steady leak  it gave little alarm at first  but
continuing to increase to such a degree as to make two pumps
constantly necessary night and day  obliging the passengers to take
their turns in common with the ship s people  the captain judged it
necessary to make the first port he could find  accordingly  on the
7th of december  we happily discovered cape finisterre  and on the 8th
arrived in the magnificent spanish port of ferrol  where we found a
squadron of french ships of the line  the officers of which think we
were very happy in making this port  as the frigate  since she has
been in this harbor  is found to make seven or eight feet of water an
hour 

the advice of all the gentlemen here is to make the best of my way to
paris by land  as it is the opinion of many  that the frigate will be
condemned  but if not  she certainly will not be ready to sail again
from this port in less than four or five weeks 

this is unfortunate to me  because  by all the information i can
obtain  travelling in this kingdom is attended with many difficulties
and delays  as well as a very great expense  there being no regular
posts as in france  and no possibility of passing over the mountainous
part of this country in carriages 

i find there has been no engagement in the european seas between the
english and the combined fleets of france and spain  as was reported
in america  there has been an epidemic sickness on board the french
fleet  which caused it to return rather sooner than was intended 
there are twentyfive spanish ships of the line in brest harbor with
the french  it is reported that m  du chaffault is appointed commander
in chief of the french fleet  and that the count d orvilliers has
retired 

captain jones has done another brilliant action  by taking a fortyfour
gun ship  after an obstinate engagement  which he carried into the
texel  but i cannot learn the particulars with much certainty or
exactness 

i have been treated with the utmost attention and politeness since my
arrival in this place  both by the spanish and french officers 
particularly by the spanish lieutenant general of marine  don joseph
st vincent  who is commander in chief of the marine  by m  de sade 
the french _chef d escadré_  and by the french consul and vice consul 
who have all obligingly offered me every assistance in their power 

i shall endeavor to inform congress of every step of my progress  as i
may find opportunity  i have heard nothing as yet  which makes it
probable to me  that i shall have anything to do openly and directly 
in pursuance of my commission very speedily  there is a confused rumor
here of a mediation of russia and holland  but i am persuaded without
foundation  it seems to be much more certain  that the english
continue in their old ill humor and insolent language  notwithstanding
their impotence grows every day more apparent 

i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

by the opportunity of a small vessel accidentally in this harbor 
bound to newburyport  i have the honor to inform congress that i have
been detained by violent rains  and several accidents  in ferrol until
yesterday  when i set out with my family for this place  and arrived
last evening without any accident  i awaited immediately on the
governor of the province  and on the governor of the town  and
received many civilities from both  and particularly from his
excellency the governor of the province of galicia  an assurance that
he was not only disposed personally to render me every hospitality and
assistance in his power  but that he had received express orders from
his court  to treat all americans who should arrive here like their
best friends  these personages were very inquisitive about american
affairs  particularly the progress of our arms  and the operations of
the count d estaing  and more particularly still about the appointment
of a minister plenipotentiary to the court of madrid  they requested
his name  character  nativity  age  whether he was a member of
congress  and whether he had been president  with many other
particulars 

to all these questions i made the best answers in my power  and with
regard to his excellency  the minister plenipotentiary at the court
of madrid  i gave them the most exact information  and such a
respectable character as the high offices he has sustained  and his
own personal merit require  it is the prevailing opinion here  that
the court of madrid is well disposed to enter into a treaty with the
united states  and that the minister from congress will be immediately
received  american independence acknowledged  and a treaty concluded 
the frigate la sensible is found to be in so bad a condition  that i
am advised by everybody to go to france by land  the season  the
roads  the accommodations for travelling are so unfavorable  that it
is not expected i can get to paris in less than thirty days  but if i
were to wait for the frigate  it would probably be much longer  i am
determined  therefore  to make the best of my way by land  and it is
possible that this journey may prove of some service to the public 
although it will be tedious and expensive to me  at least  i hope the
public will sustain no loss by it 

there are six battalions of irish troops in spain  in three regiments 
several of whose officers have visited me to assure me of their regard
to the united states  i have been this afternoon to the tower de fer
to see the island of cezarga  which was rendered famous in the course
of the last summer by being appointed the rendezvous of the french and
spanish fleets  the french fleet arrived at this island on the 9th of
june last  but were not joined by the spanish fleet from ferrol  till
some time in july  nor by the fleet from cadiz till much later  so
that the combined fleets were not able to sail for the english
channel  until the 30th of july  to prevent a similar inconvenience
another campaign  there are about twentyfive spanish ships of the line
now in brest  which are to winter there  and to be ready to sail with
the french fleets the approaching summer  at the first opening of the
season 

god grant them success and triumph  although no man wishes for peace
more sincerely than i  or would take more pleasure  or think himself
more highly honored in being instrumental in bringing it about  yet  i
confess  i see no prospect or hope of it  at least before the end of
another summer  america will be amused with rumors of peace  and
europe too  but the english are not yet in a temper for it 

the court of russia has lately changed its ambassador at the court of
london  and sometime in the month of october  m  simolin  the new
minister plenipotentiary from the court of petersburg to the court of
london  passed through france in his way to england  and resided three
weeks in paris  from this circumstance  a report has been spread in
europe  that the court of russia is about to undertake the office of
mediator between the belligerent powers  but from conversation with
several persons of distinction since my arrival in spain  particularly
with the count de sade  the chef d escadré  commanding the french men
of war now in ferrol  i am persuaded  that if russia has any thoughts
of a mediation  the independence of the united states will be insisted
upon by her as a preliminary  and great britain will feel much more
reluctance to agree to this  than to the cession of gibraltar  which
it is said spain absolutely insists upon 

i have the honor to be   c

                                         corunna  december 18th  1779 

mr adams presents his compliments to the governor of corunna  and
informs him  according to his desire expressed last evening  that the
names of the persons for whom he requests a passport from his
excellency  the governor of this province  are as follows 

john adams  a minister plenipotentiary from the united states of
america 

francis dana  secretary to mr adams s commission  a member of
congress  and a member of the council of massachusetts bay 

john thaxter  private secretary to mr adams 

john quincy adams  a son of mr adams  about twelve years of age 

charles adams  another son of mr adams  nearly ten years of age 

jeremiah allen of boston  in massachusetts  a private gentleman
accidentally in company  he is a merchant travelling with the view of
establishing a private commerce in spain  as well as france 

samuel cooper johonnot  ten or eleven years of age  a grandson of a
particular friend of mr adams in boston  going to paris for an
education in the university there 

joseph stevens  a servant of mr adams 

john william christian frieke  a servant of mr dana 

andrew desmia  a servant of mr allen 

mr adams requests a passport for all these persons to go to madrid 
and from thence to bilboa  and from thence to bayonne  in their way to
paris  with liberty at the same time to go directly to bayonne by the
nearest road  without going to madrid  or to bilboa  as it is
uncertain whether mr adams will have the time to gratify his
inclination with the sight of those cities

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write to me
on the 6th of october last 

i was well persuaded  that m  de chavagne 55  would endeavor to
procure for you everything in his power to render your passage
agreeable  this was conformable to the instructions i had given him
respecting the intentions of the king 

i learn with pleasure  that  being again charged with an important
mission by congress  you will be able to profit by the frigate
sensible a second time in your voyage to france 

i have the honor to be   c

   55  these instructions  and those for a treaty of commerce which
  follow were agreed to unanimously in congress on the 14th of august 
  nearly six weeks before the minister was chosen  they were drawn up by
  gouverneur morris 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                           bilboa  january 16th  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that last night  and not before 
i arrived at this place 

at ferrol and corunna i was advised by all the friends of america  to
undertake a journey by land  the consul of france and m  lagoanere  a
gentleman who has acted for some time as the american agent at
corunna  obligingly offered me all the assistance in their power  and
accordingly used their utmost diligence to procure me the necessary
mules and carriages  for the transportation of the small number of
persons in company with me  and the small quantity of baggage we found
it indispensably necessary to take with us  having left more than two
thirds of what we had with us to take the chance of a passage by sea
to france  from the 8th of december  when we arrived at ferrol  to the
26th of the same month  when we set off from corunna  we were detained
by the violent rains  and the impossibility of getting accommodations
for travelling  all our beds and provisions we were obliged to carry
with us  we travelled through the ancient kingdoms of galicia  leon 
old castile  and biscay  and although we made the best of our way
without loss of time  we found it impossible to go more than eight
leagues a day  and sometimes not more than four  the roads and inns
are inconvenient to a degree that i should blush to describe  and the
pain we suffered in a cold season of the year for want of fire  in a
country where there are no chimnies  gave us all such violent colds 
that i was under great apprehensions of our being seized with fevers 

as we were so near madrid  within about forty leagues  i balanced some
time in my own mind  whether to go to that fine city  but considering
that this would lengthen our journey near a hundred leagues  the
severe season of the year  and above all the political situation that
i might be in  my country not being yet acknowledged as a sovereign
state by any formal act of that court  it being known  that another
gentleman had a commission for that court  and he being expected soon
to arrive  i thought it upon the whole the least hazardous to the
public interest to avoid that route 

it may be of some use to my countrymen to transmit a few observations
upon the country i have passed through  because it appears to me that
a commerce extremely advantageous to both countries may be opened
between us and spain  as soon as our independence shall be
acknowledged by that power  at least as soon as we shall obtain the
great object of all our wishes  peace 

the province of galicia is one of the largest in spain  and said to be
one of the best peopled  corunna is in effect the principal city 
although st jago  in respect to its patron saint  or more probably to
the archbishop who resides there  is in name the capital  this
province  one of those whereof the ancient crown of castile was
formed  is washed by the ocean for more than seventy leagues from
ribadeo  on the frontiers of asturias  to the mouth of the river
minks  which separates it from portugal  this coast  which is divided
by cape finisterre  is provided on both sides of the cape with ports
equally safe and convenient  which nature seems to have prepared
around this cape  an object oftentimes so necessary to be made by
navigators  both at their departure from europe  and at their return 
as so many asylums both from the apprehensions and the consequences of
storms  the most known of these ports are ribadeo  ferrol  corunna 
and camarinas  to the eastward of cape finisterre  corubios  muros 
pontevidia  and vigo to the westward  all proper to receive vessels of
the first rate  especially ferrol and vigo  the first  the most
considerable department of the marine of spain  is embellished with
everything that art and the treasures  profusely spent upon it for
thirty years past  could add to its happy situation  vigo  represented
to be one of the most beautiful ports in the world  is another
department of the marine  more extensive and proper  for such an
establishment than ferrol itself  besides these ports  there are a
multitude of harbors and bays round cape finisterre  which afford a
safe and convenient shelter to merchant vessels  with all these
advantages for foreign commerce  this province has very little but
what is passive  it receives from abroad some objects of daily
consumption  some of luxury  some of convenience  and some even of the
first necessity  at present it offers little for exportation to
foreign countries  the sardiné of its coast  the famous fish which it
furnishes to all spain  the cattle which it fattens for the provision
of madrid  and a few coarse linens which are its only manufacture  and
are well esteemed  are the objects of its active commerce  and form
its balance with the other provinces  the wine and the grain  the
chief productions of its lands  seldom suffice for its consumption 
and never go beyond it 

the liberty of commerce with the windward islands  granted by the
court within a few years  and the particular establishment of     
opened the ports of that part of the new world to this province  and
although without manufactures herself  or any of those productions
proper for america  she renders to foreign hands the product of those
which she receives from them and carries thither  in this circulation
of so many treasures  she enriches herself with parts that she
detaches from the whole 

the civil government of this province is formed by a superior tribunal
called the _audience_  to which an appeal lies from all the subaltern
jurisdictions  public and private  this court hears and determines 
as sovereign and without appeal  all civil affairs of a less value
than a thousand ducats  or three thousand livres  appeals in those
which exceed that value are carried to the chancery of valladolid  or
to the council of castile  although justice is gratis on the part of
the judges  who are paid by the government  it is said to be not less
costly  tedious  and vexatious  it may not be useless to observe that
the criminal chambers  whose decrees extend to the punishment of
death  and are executed without any application to the king or any
other authority  is composed only of three judges  and these three are
the youngest of the whole tribunal  and this order is generally
followed in spain in the composition of the criminal tribunals 
although no one pretends to conjecture the motive of so singular a
reverse of the rational order of things  the administration of the
royal police belongs also to the audience  and forms the third chamber
into which this tribunal is divided 

all the military authority  and the government of the troops in this
department  are in the hands of the captain general of the province 
there is not any one under him who has even the title of commandant 
but in case of his death or absence  he is succeeded by the general
officer  the most ancient in the province  to this title of captain
general is added  commonly  that of president of the audience  a
prerogative which  by uniting in his hands the civil authority to all
that of his place  gives a power the most absolute and unlimited 

the inspection general  and all the economy of the affairs of the king
in the province  belong to the intendant  the different branches of
the public revenue are all administered by officers appointed by the
king  as in the rest of the kingdom  and there are no farmers general
as in france  their product is about twentysix millions of reals  or
six millions five hundred thousand livres  the expense of collection
being deducted  the expenses of the administration  including the
maintenance of three regiments of infantry scattered about in
different places  do not exceed two millions five hundred thousand
livres  the surplus goes into the dry docks  arsenals  and fund of
fortifications  to the support of which this sum is far from being
sufficient  such is in general the government  military  political 
and civil of this province  and nearly pf all the others  except
biscay  guipuscoa  and alaba 

there is not in this province any particular jurisdiction of commerce 
but there is a tribunal  under the name of the judge considerator of
commerce  which takes cognizance of all their causes  civil and
criminal  except the case of contraband  at this day  the judge
considerator of strangers is the governor of the province himself  and
the appeals from his judgment are carried directly to the council of
war  which is said to be a precious privilege  by the form and brevity
of procedure compared with the expensive and insupportable delays of
the ordinary jurisdiction 

i cannot but think that if some measures could be taken to convince
the court  that it is their interest to take off the vast duties with
which commerce is overloaded in this port  fifteen per cent being to
be paid upon all commodities exported and upon all imported  and if
the rigid prohibitions of tobacco could be relaxed or repealed 
several of the productions of america would find a good market here 
and a commerce be opened that would put a new face upon this province 
and be profitable to america too  the conveniency of such a number of
excellent ports would be a vast advantage  which bilboa cannot have 
as her harbor is neither safe nor convenient  besides its being so
much further down the stormy  turbulent gulf of biscay  yet biscay 
which is commonly used to comprehend biscay proper  the principal city
of which is bilboa  although orduna is the capital  guipuscoa  the
capital of which is st sebastian  and alaba  the capital of which is
vittoria  three free provinces  whose laws the kings of spain have
hitherto been sworn to observe inviolate  have attracted almost the
whole of the american trade  because the king has no custom house or
officers here  and there are no duties to be paid 

it may seem surprising to hear of free provinces in spain  but such is
the fact  that the high and independent spirit of the people  so
essentially different from the other provinces  that a traveller
perceives it even in their countenances  their dress  their air  and
their ordinary manner of speech  has induced the spanish nation and
her kings to respect the ancient liberties of these people so far 
that each monarch at his accession to the throne takes an oath to
observe the laws of biscay  the government here is therefore
diametrically opposite to that of galicia  and the other provinces 
the king of spain has never assumed any higher title than lord of
biscay  he has no troops of any sort in the lordship  nor is there any
standing array  instead of which every man is obliged to serve in the
militia  the king has no custom house officers  nor other revenue
officers  nor any other officers whatsoever in the lordship except a
corregidor  and lately a commissary of marine  this last is considered
as an encroachment and a grievance  and the authority of the
corregidor is very small  as there lies an appeal from his judgment
to another tribunal  that of the two deputy generals  who are
biennially elected by the people  few of the grandees of spain have
any considerable estates here  the duke of medina coeli  and the duke
of berwick  have some lands here of no great value  the lands 
generally  belong to the inhabitants and possessors  who hold them of
no lord but the king of spain  who is lord of biscay 

there is a board of trade here  which is annually instituted by the
merchants of the place  partly by lot and partly by election  which
decides all controversies arising in trade  and all the affairs of
strangers  they have never admitted any foreign consul to reside here 
although it has been solicited by holland  england  and france 

it is not at all surprising  that a constitution in its nature so
favorable to commerce  should have succeeded 

in travelling through the provinces of leon and castile  and observing
the numerous flocks of sheep  with the most beautiful fleeces of wool
in the world  i could not but wish that some communication might be
opened  by which the united states of america might be furnished with
this necessary article from this country  there are few of our
articles of exportation but might be sent to the spanish market to
advantage  rice  pitch  tar  turpentine  tobacco  wheat  flour  ship
timber  masts  yards  bowsprits  and salt fish might be supplied to
spain  and at an advantage  and in return  she might furnish us wine 
oil  fruits  some silks  some linens  perhaps  and with any quantity
of wool  which is now exported to foreign countries for manufacture 
and might as well be sent to us  but above all with silver and gold 

it must be the work of time and a free intercourse between the two
nations  and a future negotiation to ripen these hints into a plan
that may be beneficial to both  the system of revenue  which it is
dangerous and difficult to alter in spain  as well as in all other
countries of europe  will be the principal objection  i have collected
together with some difficulty a few gazettes  which i have the honor
to transmit to congress  from which all the news may be collected that
i have been able to learn  congress will easily perceive the eagerness
with which the belligerent powers are bent on war  without manifesting
the least disposition for peace  and most of all  great britain  whose
ostentatious display of trifling successes  and whose weak exultation
shows  that nothing can divert her from her furious course  but she is
exhausting and sinking her forces every day  without gaining any
lasting or solid advantage  and she has reason to fear  from the
combined fleets of france and spain  under such enterprising 
experienced  and approved officers  as d estaing and du chaffault  the
entire ruin of her commerce and navy in the course of a campaign or
two more 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

having obtained permission from your excellency yesterday  when i did
myself the honor to wait on you at versailles  to write on the subject
of my mission  i have now the honor to acquaint you  that on the 29th
day of september last the congress of the united states of america did
me the honor to elect me their plenipotentiary to negotiate a peace
with great britain  and also to negotiate a treaty of commerce with
that kingdom  and mr francis dana  member of congress  and of the
council of massachusetts bay  secretary to both commissions 

as i was not at congress when this transaction took place  i am not
able to inform your excellency very particularly of the rise and
progress of it  but from conversation with gentlemen at boston  who
were members of congress  and from private letters  i learned in
general  that it was not the result of any sudden deliberation  or the
fruit of any particular event of the war  prosperous or adverse  but a
measure that has been more than a year under consideration  and
finally agreed to on this principle  that as it was uncertain at what
time the belligerent powers might be disposed to treat of peace  which
could not be concluded without a minister from the united states  it
would save a great deal of time for this power to have a minister in
europe fully authorised to treat  and in concert with ministers from
the other powers at war  conclude a peace with great britain  and a
treaty of commerce consistent with that already made with his most
christian majesty  and such others as might be made with other powers 
i am persuaded it is the intention of my constituents and of all
america  and i am sure it is my own determination  to take no steps of
consequence in pursuance of my commissions  without consulting his
majesty s ministers  and as various conjectures have been  and may be
made concerning the nature of my appointment and powers  and as it may
be expected by some  that i should take some measures for announcing
these to the public  or at least to the court of london  i beg the
favor of your excellency s opinion and advice upon these questions 

1  whether  in the present state of things  it is prudent in me to
acquaint the british ministry that i am arrived here  and that i shall
be ready to treat  whenever the belligerent powers shall be inclined
to treat 

2  whether it is prudent in me to publish in any manner  more than the
journals of congress may have already done  the nature of my mission 

3  or whether to remain on the reserve  as i have hitherto done since
my arrival in europe 

if any propositions should be made to me directly or indirectly from
the british ministry  i shall not fail to communicate them without
loss of time to your excellency  and i beg the favor of your
excellency  as i am the only person in europe who has authority to
treat of peace  that if any propositions on the part of great britain
should be made to his majesty s ministers  that they may be
communicated to me  at least as far as they may relate to the interest
of the united states 

although i am not confined by commissions  nor instructions  nor by
any intimations from congress to reside in any one place in europe
more than another  yet my own inclinations as well as those of the
public would be most gratified  and the public service most promoted 
by my residing here  i must  therefore  request his majesty s
protection and permission to reside in this kingdom for some time 
with or without assuming any public character  as your excellency may
think most advisable 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

it was not until my arrival at passy  that i had the honor of your
excellency s letter of the 31st of december last 

when his majesty s intentions of granting me a passage to america were
communicated to me  i had little expectation of returning in the same
frigate  but the congress having honored me with a fresh mission to
europe  their excellencies  the late and present ministers from his
majesty to the united states  concurred in a proposal to congress  and
a requisition to the commander of the frigate  to afford me a passage
in her voyage home  which captain chavagne agreed to with particular
marks of politeness to me and mr dana  and the others who accompanied
me 

i have again to express to your excellency the obligations i am under
to the captain  and all the officers of the sensible  for their
goodness to me and mine  but it is more particularly my duty to
express again my thanks to his majesty  for this fresh favor  to m 
gerard and the chevalier de la luzerne  who procured it for me  and to
your excellency  for your approbation of it 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on
the 12th of this month  i think before i reply to the different
points on which you consult me  that it is proper to wait for the
arrival of m  gerard  because he is probably the bearer of your
instructions  and will certainly be able to make me better acquainted
with the nature and extent of your commission  but in the mean time  i
am of opinion  that it will be prudent to conceal your eventual
character  and above all to take the necessary precautions  that the
object of your commission may remain unknown to the court of london 
besides  sir  you may be assured  that his majesty sees you with
pleasure in his dominions  that you will constantly enjoy his
protection  and the prerogatives of the law of nations  for my own
part  sir  i shall be eager to give you proofs of my confidence  as
well as of the sentiments with which i have the honor to be   c

                                           paris  february 15th  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to inform congress  that on the 9th of this month 
and not before  i had the good fortune to arrive in this city  from
ferrol  where i arrived on the 8th of december  with mr dana  mr
thaxter  and the rest of the company in tolerable health  after a
journey of near five hundred leagues  in the dead of winter  through
bad roads  and worse accommodations of every kind  we lost no time
more than was indispensably necessary to restore our health  which was
several times affected  and in great danger  yet we were more than
twice as long in making the journey by land  as we had been in
crossing the atlantic ocean 

the next morning after our arrival at paris  mr dana and myself went
out to passy  and spent the day with his excellency dr franklin  who
did us the honor the next day to accompany us to versailles  where we
had the honor to wait on their excellencies the count de vergennes  m 
de sartine  and the count maurepas  with each of whom we had the honor
of a short conference  upon the state of public affairs  it is
sufficient for me to say in general  that i never heard the french
ministry so frank  so explicit  so decided  as each of these gentlemen
was in the course of this conversation  in his declarations to persue
the war with vigor  and to afford effectual aid to the united states 
i learned with great satisfaction  that they are sending  under
convoy  clothing and arms for fifteen thousand men to america  that
seventeen ships of the line were already gone to the west indies 
under m  de guichen  and that five or six more at least are to follow 
in addition to ten or twelve they have already there  i asked
permission of the count de vergennes to write to him on the subject of
my mission  which he cheerfully and politely agreed to  i have
accordingly written to his excellency  and shall forward copies of my
letter and his answer  as soon as it may be safe to do it 

the english are to borrow twelve millions this year  and it is said 
that the loan is filled up  they have thrown a sop to ireland  but
have not appeased her rage  they give out exactly such threats as they
did last year  and every other year  of terrible preparations  but
congress knows perfectly well how these measures have been
accomplished  they will not be more fully executed the next year than
the last  and if france and spain should throw more of their force 
especially by sea  into america the next year  america will have no
essential injury to fear 

i have learned since my arrival at paris  with the highest pleasure 
the arrival of m  gerard  mr jay  and mr carmichael  at cadiz  for
whose safety we had been under great apprehensions  i have now very
solid hopes  that a treaty will soon be concluded with spain  hopes
which everything that i saw and heard seemed to favor 

the alliance frigate  now under the command of captain jones  with
captain cunningham on board  is arrived at corunna  where she is to be
careened  after which she is to return to l orient  and from thence to
go to america  as i am informed by dr franklin 

mr auther lee  and mr izard  are still in paris  under many
difficulties in procuring a passage home  mr william lee is at
brussels  mr izard has been to holland  to obtain a passage from
thence  but unfortunately missed his opportunity and returned
disappointed 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

it is necessary  that i should inform congress in what manner i have
been able to procure money to defray my expenses in my long journey 
through the greatest part of spain and france to this city 

on my arrival at ferrol  i was offered the loan of money by the french
consul  m  de tournelle  who  at the same time told me  there was a
gentleman at corunna  m  michael lagoanere  who had heretofore acted
as an american agent at that place  and who would be very happy to
supply me  on my arrival at corunna  m  lagoanere did me the honor of
a visit  and offered me every assistance in cash  otherwise telling me
at the same time  he had some money in his hands  which he supposed
belonged to the united states  being part of the proceeds of some
prizes heretofore made by captain cunningham  that this money 
however  had been attached in his hands by some spanish merchant  who
had commenced a lawsuit against captain cunningham  i accordingly
received three thousand dollars for myself and mr dana  and a letter
of credit on the house of cabarous at bayonne  for as much more as i
should have occasion for  on our arrival at bayonne  mr dana and i
received of that house fifty louis d ors  and a bill of exchange on
another house of the same name and family at bordeaux for the like
sums  our expenses having exceeded all our computations at corunna  as
our journey was necessarily much longer than we expected  on account
of the uncommon bad weather and bad roads  this bill was paid upon
sight  so that  upon the whole  we have received the amount of
seventeen thousand four hundred livres  all on account of m  lagoanere
of corunna  of this sum  mr dana has received the amount of four
thousand nine hundred and seventyone livres and fifteen sols  and i
have received twelve thousand four hundred and twentyeight livres and
five sols  for which sums we desire to be respectively charged in the
treasury books of congress 

as this money is expended  if m  lagoanere should draw upon us for it 
all the authority we have to draw upon his excellency the minister
here will not enable us to pay it  and if m  lagoanere should be so
happy as to avoid the attachment and leave us to account with congress
for this money  the small sum we are empowered to receive from his
excellency will go a very little way in discharging our expenses  we
must therefore pray  that congress would forward us authority to draw
upon his excellency for the amount of our salaries annually  which 
without all doubt  will be paid 

i have the honor to be  with the highest respect   c

  my dear general 

you know extremely well the skill of our enemies in forging false
news  and their artifice in circulating it  not only through the
various parts of europe  but in the united states of america  to keep
up the spirits of their friends and depress those of their
adversaries  it is their annual custom in the winter to send abroad
large cargoes of these lies  and they meet with a success in making
them believed  that is really astonishing 

since my arrival here  i find they have been this winter at their old
game again  and have circulated reports here  in holland  and other
parts of europe  that they have made new contracts with other petty
princes in germany  by which  together with those made before  they
will be able to draw seven thousand fresh troops from that country to
serve in america  that by appeasing the troubles in ireland  they
shall be able to avail themselves even of the military associations
in that kingdom  by depending upon them for the defence of the
country  and to draw near ten thousand men from thence for the service
in america  that they have concluded a treaty with the court of
petersburg  by which russia is to furnish them with twelve ships of
the line and twenty thousand men  which they say is of the more
importance  on account of the intimate connexion between russia and
denmark  as the latter will be likely by this means to be drawn into
the war  with their numerous fleet of fortyfive ships of the line  the
greatest part of these tales are false  i know very well what is said
of russia is so contrary to all that i have seen and heard of the good
understanding between versailles and russia  that i have no doubt of
its falsehood  but as i am very lately arrived  and  consequently 
have not opportunity to examine these reports to the bottom  i beg the
favor of you to inform me  with all the exactness possible  how much
truth there is in them  if any at all 

you are very sensible that it is of the utmost importance  that
congress should have the exactest information of these things  and
that you and i cannot render a more useful service to our country at
present  than by collecting such intelligence with precision  and
transmitting it without delay  knowing the pleasure you take in
serving the united states in every way in your power  i thought i
could beg this favor of you with propriety  and that you would believe
me always your friend and servant 

                                                           john adams

                                           paris  february 18th  1780 

  dear sir 

whether it is  that the art of political lying is better understood in
england than in any other country  or whether it is more practised
there than elsewhere  or whether it is accidental that they have more
success in making their fictions gain credit in the world  i know not 
but it is certain  that every winter since the commencement of the
present war with america  and indeed for some years before  they sent
out large quantities of this manufacture over all europe  and
throughout all america  and what is astonishing is  that they should
still find numbers in every country ready to take them off their
hands 

since my arrival in this city  i find they have been this winter at
their old trade  and have spread reports here and in holland  and in
various other parts of europe  and no doubt they have found means to
propagate them in america too  tending to keep up the spirits of their
friends  and to sink those of their opponents  such as  that they have
made new contracts with several german princes  by which they are to
obtain seven thousand men to serve in america  that they have so
skilfully appeased the troubles in ireland  that they shall ever be
able to take advantage of the military associations there  by
depending upon them for the defence of the kingdom  while they draw
from thence ten thousand regular troops for the service in america 
that they have even concluded a treaty with russia  by which the
empress is to furnish them with twelve ships of the line and twenty
thousand men  as some say  and twenty ship of the line and twelve
thousand men as others relate  this they say is of the greater moment 
because of an intimate connexion  i know not of what nature it is 
between russia and denmark  by which the latter will be likely to be
drawn into the war against the house of bourbon and america  and
denmark  they say  has fortyfive ships of the line 

i know very well that the greatest part of these reports is false  and
particularly what is said of russia is so contrary to all those
reports  which i have heard for these twelve months past of the
harmony between versailles and petersburg  that i give no credit to it
at all  but i find that all these reports make impressions on some
minds  and among the rest some americans 

i therefore beg the favor of you to inform me of the exact truth in
all these matters  that i may take the earliest opportunity of
transmitting the intelligence to congress  where it is of importance
it should be known 

i was much mortified when i was at versailles the other day  that i
could not have the honor of paying my respects to you  but i was so
connected with other gentlemen  who were obliged to return to dinner 
that i could not  but i shall take the first opportunity i can get to
wait on you  and assure you that i am  with great respect   c

                                           paris  february 19th  1780 

  dear sir 

as i came but this morning from versailles  it was not in my power
sooner to answer the letter you have honored me with  and this duty i
now perform with the more pleasure  as it is of some importance to the
interests of america  since the first day  when i had the happiness of
making myself and of being considered in the world as an american  i
have always observed  that among the many ways of attacking our
liberties  and among the most ungenerous ones  misrepresentations have
ever been the first weapons on which the british nation has the most
depended 

i am glad it is in my power generally to assure you  that the many
reports propagated by them and alluded to in your letter are not
founded upon truth  new contracts with petty princes in germany have
not  i believe  taken place  and if any such merchandise were sent to
america  it would at most consist of a few recruits  the troubles in
ireland  if there is the least common sense among the first patriots
of that country  are not i hope at an end  and it seems they now begin
to raise our expectations  the russian troops  so much talked of in
their gazettes  i take to be mere recruits for those thirty thousand
russians  that mr rivington had three years ago ordered to embark for
america 

those intelligences  my dear sir  must be counteracted by letters to
our friends in america  but as the respect  which we owe to the free
citizens of the united states  makes it a point of duty never to
deceive them  and as the most candid frankness must ever distinguish
our side of the question from the course of tyranny and falsehood  i
intend paying tomorrow morning a visit to the minister of foreign
affairs  and from him get such minute intelligence as shall answer
your purpose 

with the most sincere regard  i have the honor to be   c 

                                                            lafayette 

_p  s _ on my return from versailles  my dear sir  where i will settle
the affairs of arms that i have undertaken  i will impart to you a
project privately relating to me  that is not inconsistent with my
sentiments for our country  america 

                                                                    l 

                                                   

                    to the president of congress 

                                           paris  february 19th  1780 

  sir 

enclosed are copies of former letters to congress  and i shall
continue to transmit copies  until i learn that some have arrived  for
which reason i must request the favor that his excellency the
president  or some committee  may be desired to acknowledge the
receipt of letters  so that i may know as soon as may be  what letters
have arrived  and which have been less fortunate 

the art of making and spreading false news to answer political
purposes is not peculiar to great britain  but yet she seems to
possess this art  and the talent of giving to her fictions the colors
of probability beyond other nations  at least  she seems to have more
success in making her impostures believed than any other  it is her
annual practice in the winter to fabricate and export large quantities
of this merchandise to all parts of europe and america  and she finds
more customers to take them off her hands than she ought  considering
how illicit the traffic is 

this winter her emissaries have been more assiduous than ever in
propagating reports  that they have entered into new engagements with
several other petty principalities in germany  by which they shall
hire seven thousand men  for the service of the next campaign in
america  that by compromising with ireland  they shall be able to take
advantage even of the military associations in that kingdom  and draw
from them a large number of regular troops for the service in america 
depending on the volunteer militia  or associators for the defence of
the country  that they have made a treaty with russia  whereby that
power has engaged to furnish them with twelve ships of the line and
twenty thousand troops  as some say  and twenty ships of the line and
twelve thousand troops  according to others  this alliance they say
too is of the more consequence  on account of some connexion between
russia and denmark  who  it is insinuated  will follow russia into the
war  and denmark they add has fortyfive ships of the line  not manned
it is true  but england they say can man them 

these tales one would think are so extravagant and absurd  that they
would not find a believer in the world  yet there are persons  who
believe them in all nations of europe  particularly in holland  and
there is no doubt the same song will be sung in america  and many will
listen to it  there is nothing further from the truth  they will find
the utmost difficulty to draw from germany troops enough to repair the
breaches in the german troops made in america the last year  the same
with regard to ireland  and as to what is said of russia  there is not
even a color of truth in it  but on the contrary  the same good
understanding continues between versailles and petersburg  which
subsisted last winter  spring  and summer  as to denmark  i have no
reason to think that she is disposed to assist great britain  but on
the contrary that she has armed to defend herself at sea against great
britain  but if it were otherwise  to what purpose would her ships of
the line be unmanned  when great britain cannot man the ships of the
line she already has 

france seems determined to pursue the naval war with vigor and
decision in the american seas  m  de guichen sailed the beginning of
january with seventeen or eighteen ships of the line  seven more are
now preparing at brest with all possible expedition  supposed to be
for america  those  if they all happily join the twelve ships left
there by the count d estaing  will make a fleet of six and thirty
ships of the line  and the court seems determined to maintain the
superiority in the american seas  this will give scope to our
privateers to weaken and distress the enemies of their country  while
they are enriching themselves 

there is no news of admiral rodney  from whence i conclude he is gone
to the west indies 

the english have derived such a flush of spirits from their late
successes  which are mostly however of the negative kind  that they
talk in a style very different from that of peace  there are two
reflections  which the english cannot bear  one is that of losing the
domination of the colonies as indispensable to the support of their
naval superiority over france and spain  or either of them  in
possession of a powerful fleet at the peace  their maxim is to make
themselves terrible at sea to all nations  and they are convinced that
if they make a peace leaving america independent  and france and spain
powerful at sea  they shall never again be terrible to any maritime
power  these reasons convince me  that great britain will hazard all
rather than make peace at present  thompson s  britannia   which
expresses the feelings as well as the sentiments of every briton  is
so much to the present purpose  that i hope i shall be pardoned for
referring to it  even in a letter to congress 

i have the honor to be  with the highest esteem   c

  sir 

i have received the letter  which your excellency did me the honor to
write me on the 15th of this month  and lest i should not have
explained sufficiently in my letter of the 12th the nature and extent
of my commissions  i have now the honor to enclose attested copies of
both  as well as of that to mr dana 

with regard to my instructions  i presume your excellency will not
judge it proper  that i should communicate them any further than to
assure you  as i do in the fullest manner  that they contain nothing
inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the treaty between his
majesty and the united states  or the most perfect friendship between
france and america  but  on the contrary  the clearest orders to
cultivate both  i have hitherto conducted according to your advice 
having never communicated to any person since my arrival in europe the
nature of my mission  excepting to your excellency and dr franklin  to
whom it was indeed communicated by a resolution of congress  and to
him in confidence  i shall continue to conceal  as far as may depend
upon me  my actual character  but i ought to observe to your
excellency  that my appointment was as notorious in america as that
of mr jay  or dr franklin  before my departure  so it is probably
already known to the court of london  although they have not regular
evidence of it  i mention this  lest some persons might charge me with
publishing what i certainly did not publish 

i thank your excellency for the assurances of his majesty s protection
and of your confidence  which it shall be my study and endeavor at all
times to deserve 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                      versailles  february 20th  1780 

  sir 

you have been afraid to trouble the count de vergennes  and you have
done me the honor of addressing yourself to me  in order to know what
you are to think of several rumors  which the english have endeavored
to spread  i am infinitely flattered by the mark of confidence  which
you have been pleased to give me  but i have thought myself obliged to
lay the letter before the minister  he has directed me to assure you 
that on every occasion he will be very happy that you should address
yourself directly to him  and that you will always find him ready to
satisfy your inquiries 

he has remarked  as well as yourself  the address which our enemies
use to circulate false reports  and to make europe believe that the
americans are making advances to them  in order to treat of an
arrangement with them  the count de vergennes is likewise persuaded
of the contrary  as he is assured that no new treaty has been
negotiated with the princes of germany  and that no levies are making
there  but for the sake of filling up the old ones  he does not think
that the news of the treaty with russia  nor that which relates to the
court of denmark  are better founded  he told me that i might do
myself the honor to write you  that all those rumors are false  and
that you run no risk in presenting them as such to the persons  on
whom you think they have made some impression  both in europe and
america 

i am extremely anxious to have the honor to see you  and congratulate
you on your happy return  as i but seldom go to paris  i wish your
business may permit you to do me the honor to call at my house and
accept of a family dinner 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                           paris  february 20th  1780 

  sir 

since my arrival in europe  i have had the mortification to see in the
public papers a series of little successes  which our enemies have had
in the prosecution of the war  the first was a very exaggerated
account in the english court gazette  of their successes against the
spaniards in south america  the next was the history of the repulse of
general lincoln and the count d estaing at savannah  and the raising
of the siege at that post  these were soon followed by the capture of
the spanish fleet of transport ships by rodney s squadron  and the
advantage gained by that admiral over the spanish ships of war  after
a most gallant resistance  however  off gibraltar 

these small triumphs  although chiefly of the defensive and negative
kind  and a poor compensation for the blood and the millions they are
annually wasting  are  however  sufficient to cheer the spirits of the
british populace  and to banish from the minds of the ministry all
thoughts of peace upon reasonable terms  for the english in the
present war act upon a maxim diametrically opposite to that of the
romans  and never think of peace upon any event fortunate to them  but
are anxious for it under every great adversity 

a report of my appointment having also been carried to england by the
cartels from boston  and being spread in europe by various other ways 
by passengers in the committee  by french passengers in the sensible 
of whom there were a great number who had heard of it in all companies
in america  and by many private letters  and the english ministerial
writers having made use of this as evidence of a drooping spirit in
america in order to favor their loan of money  i thought it my best
policy to communicate my appointment and powers to the french court 
and ask their advice  as our good allies  how to proceed in the
present emergency  i accordingly wrote to his excellency  the count de
vergennes  the letter of the 12th of february  a copy of which is
enclosed  and received his answer of the 15th  a copy of which is
enclosed  to which i replied in a letter of the 19th  a copy of which
is also enclosed  when i shall receive his excellency s answer  i
shall do myself the honor to enclose that 

if there is anything in these letters of mine  which is not
conformable to the views and sentiments of congress  i wish to be
instructed in it  or if congress should not concur with his excellency
the count  i shall obey their orders with the utmost punctuality and
alacrity  i have ever understood  that congress were first advised to
the measure of appointing a minister to negotiate peace  by the french
minister then at philadelphia  in the name of the count de vergennes 
however this may have been  it cannot be improper to have some one in
europe empowered to think and treat of peace  which some time or other
must come 

since my last  which was of yesterday s date  i have had opportunity
to make more particular inquiries concerning the pretended treaty with
russia  and am informed  that the english ministry did  not long
since  make a formal application by their ambassador to the empress of
russia for a body of troops and a number of ships  but that the
application was opposed with great spirit and ability in the russian
council  particularly by the minister for foreign affairs  and
rejected in council with great unanimity  and that the harmony between
versailles and petersburg remains as perfect as when i left france 

i have the honor to be  with very great respect   c

                                            paris  february 22d  1780 

  dear sir 

i most sincerely congratulate you on your happy arrival in europe 
which must be the more agreeable to you  for the terrible voyages you
have had  every good american in europe  i believe  suffered a great
anxiety from the length of time that passed between the day when it
was known  that the confederacy sailed  and the time when the news
arrived of your being in cadiz  i  too  have had my hairbreadth
escapes  and  after my arrival  a very tedious journey in the worst
season of the year by land  happy  however  shall we be  if all our
hazards and fatigues should contribute to lay the foundation of a free
and prosperous people 

i hope no accident or disagreeable circumstance has happened to your
family  to whom i shall be obliged to you to present my respects  from
what i saw and heard in spain  from the strong assurances i received
of the good will of the court and nation  and from the great attention
and respect  that were paid me by officers of government of the
highest rank in the provinces through which i passed  i am persuaded
you will meet with the most distinguished reception  and i hope will
soon have the honor and satisfaction of concluding a treaty with
spain  you will have the advantage of more frequent and speedy
intelligence from home  than we can have here  at least you will have
it in your power  there are vessels oftener arriving from america at
bilboa and cadiz  i think  than in france  many of these vessels come
from boston and newburyport  perhaps the most of them  so that by
directing your correspondents to send their letters that way  you will
have them much sooner than we can commonly obtain them  and by
transmitting yours to messrs gardoqui   co  at bilboa  and mr
montgomery  or some other  at cadiz  your despatches will go more
speedily  and more safely than ours  for we find it almost impossible
to get a letter across the bay of biscay from france in a merchant
vessel  there are so many privateers in the route  the danger of whom
is avoided chiefly by vessels from bilboa keeping near the coast  and
running into harbor in case of danger  and wholly by those from cadiz 
you will excuse my mentioning to you this channel of intelligence 
which might not possibly have occurred to you  and my wishing to make
some advantage of it to myself  by asking the favor of your
correspondence  and that you will impart to me the advices you may
receive through it 

we have nothing new here at present  but what you have had before 
pray what think you of peace  it seems to be the will of heaven  that
the english should have success enough to lead them on to final
destruction  they are quite intoxicated with their late advantages 
although a poor compensation for what they cost

  sir 

having been informed this morning by the marquis de lafayette  of
another opportunity for america  i have the honor to enclose to
congress triplicates of former letters  and copies of some other
letters  which i have written and received lately  i have also packed
up all the newspapers and pamphlets i can obtain  the _mercure de
france_ is a weekly publication of very ancient origin  and is become
lately very interesting to america  because those political
intelligences and speculations  which were formerly published in
another pamphlet  under the title of _affaires de l angleterre et de
l amérique_ are now published in this  the other having been dropped 
the _courrier de l europe_ has the most extensive circulation of any
gazette  although supposed to be rather too much under the influence
of the british ministry sometimes  the _gazette de france_ is
published by authority here  and has a great reputation for integrity 
in the _gazette de la hague_ the english find means to publish many
false reports  these papers and pamphlets  together with one or two
english papers  for which i shall subscribe as soon as possible  i
shall do myself the honor to transmit to congress constantly as they
come out  from these  congress will be able to collect from time to
time all the public news of europe 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect   c

  dear sir 

you will see by the public papers  that your committee of
correspondence is making greater progress in the world  and doing
greater things in the political world  than the electrical rod ever
did in the physical  ireland and england have adopted it  but mean
plagiaries as they are  they do not acknowledge who was the inventor
of it  mr lee and mr izard will go with this letter in the alliance 
and probably go to boston  they will be able to inform you of
everything of a public nature much better than i can do  as i have
scarcely had opportunity to look about me as yet  they will give you
few hopes of peace  at least very speedily 

the associations of counties and committees of correspondence in
england  are very ominous to our old acquaintances the refugees  as
they attack unmerited pensions in the first place  but they must do
greater things than distressing these gentry  they must necessarily
produce great commotions in the nation  the speeches at these meetings
go great lengths  some of them openly justifying and applauding the
americans  and others even applauding france and spain for stepping in
to our assistance  the court here seems determined more than ever to
pursue the war with vigor  especially by sea  and above all in the
american seas  they have already sent seventeen ships of the line
under m  de guichen  to reinforce m  de la motte piquet  and seven
others are preparing at brest  they are sending out clothing and arms
for fifteen thousand men for our army  and seem confident  that the
next campaign will be better than the last  i hope the spirit of
privateering among us will increase  because i think this is the way
in which we can do the most service to the common cause  i hope you
will be so good as to inform me of what passes  particularly what
progress the convention makes in the constitution  56  i assure you it
is more comfortable making constitutions in the dead of winter at
cambridge or boston  than sailing in a leaky ship  or climbing on
foot  or upon mules  over the mountains of galicia  and the pyrenees 

  believe me your friend and servant 
                                                           john adams

  dear sir 

the french court seems to be now every day more and more convinced of
the good policy  and indeed the necessity of prosecuting the war with
vigor in the american seas  they have been  and are making great
preparations accordingly  and are determined to maintain a clear
superiority 

m  de la motte piquet has with him the hannibal  the magnifique  the
diadème  the dauphin royal  the artisane  the réfléchi  and the
vengeur  and if m  de grace has joined him from the chesapeake bay 
the robuste  the fendant  and the sphinx  in all ten ships of the
line  m  de guichen has gone to join him with the couronne  eighty
guns  the triumphant  eighty  the palmier  the victoire  the destin 
the conquérant  the citoyen  the intrépide  the hercule  and the
souverain  all of seventyfour  the jason  the actionnaire  the caton 
the julien  the solitaire  the st michael  and the triton  all of
sixtyfour  the frigates  the medea  courageuse  gentille  and the
charmante  all of thirtytwo  he had above a hundred sail of vessels
under his convoy  and the regiment of touraine and enghien  of more
than thirteen hundred men each  and the second battalions of royal
corntois  and of walsh  of seven hundred men each  making in the whole
more than four thousand troops  besides these  there are seven more
preparing at brest to sail 

m  gerard  mr jay  and mr carmichael are arrived at cadiz in a french
frigate  the confederacy having been dismasted  and driven to
martinique  the alliance carries this with mr lee and mr izard  who
will no doubt be treated with all respect at boston 

notwithstanding the commotions in england and ireland  the success of
provost at savannah  and of rodney off gibraltar  and even the silly
story of omoa  in south america  is enough to embolden the ministry to
go on with a debt of two hundred millions  already contracted  to
borrow twelve or fourteen millions a year  in the beginning of a war
with france and spain  each having a greater navy than they ever had 
each discovering a greater fighting spirit than they ever did before 
and obliging the english to purchase every advantage at a dear rate 
the premiums and bounties  that they are obliged to give to raise men 
both for the service by sea and land  and the interest of money they
borrow  are greater than were ever given in any former wars  even in
the last year of the last war  this cannot always last  nor indeed
long  yet i do not expect to see peace very soon 

pray write me as often as possible  and send the newspapers to me 

  your friend and servant

  sir 

i have received the letter  which you have done me the honor to write
me the 19th of this month  your full powers  of which you have been
pleased to send me a copy  are perfectly conformable to what m  gerard
has written to me about them  and they leave us nothing to wish for 
as to the form or matter  i think there will be no inconveniency in
informing the public of the principal object of your mission  i mean
the future pacification  it will be announced in the gazette of
france  when it will mention your presentation to the king and royal
family  and you will be at liberty to give your eventual character a
greater publicity  by having it published in the dutch papers  i could
only wish  that you would be so kind as to communicate the article to
me before you transmit it  with regard to the full powers  which
authorise you to negotiate a treaty of commerce with the court of
london  i think it will be prudent not to communicate them to any body
whatever  and to take every necessary precaution  that the british
ministry may not have a premature knowledge of them  you will no doubt
easily feel the motives  which induce me to advise you to take this
precaution  and it would be needless to explain them 

with regard to your instructions  sir  i am satisfied that they have
for their certain and invariable basis  the treaties subsisting
between the king and the united states  m  gerard has assured the king
of it  in the most positive manner  and his majesty does more justice
to the uprightness of congress  and to the stability of the sentiments
which they have hitherto manifested  than to have ever entertained  or
to entertain  the least doubt on this subject  this way of thinking
will convince you  sir  that we have no need of seeing your
instructions  to appreciate properly the principles and dispositions
of congress towards great britain 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i had last evening the honor of your excellency s letter of
yesterday s date  and shall conform myself to your advice 

i shall esteem myself highly honored by a presentation to the king and
royal family  and shall wait your excellency s directions concerning
the time of it  and shall not think myself at liberty to make any
publication of my powers to treat of peace  until it shall have been
announced in the gazette  after which  i shall transmit to your
excellency any paragraph  which may be thought proper to publish in
the gazettes of holland  and take your advice upon it  before it is
sent  my other powers shall be concealed  according to your advice 
and i shall have the honor to pay my respects to your excellency very
soon at versailles

  sir 

since my letter of the 20th  i have received another letter from his
excellency the count de vergennes  dated the 24th of february  which i
answered this day  copies of both letters are enclosed 

i have also the honor to enclose a gazette  and an application from mr
comyn  of marseilles  to be a consul for the ports of provence and
languedoc  i know nothing of this gentleman but what he says of
himself 

by the enclosed gazette  as well as by many others  congress will see
of what wonderful efficacy in pulling down tyranny a committee of
correspondence is likely to be  ireland has done great things by means
of it  england is attempting great things with it  after the example
of the americans  who invented it  and first taught its use  yet all
does not seem to produce the proper gratitude on the minds of the
english towards their benefactors  however  the glory of the invention
is as certainly ours  as that of electrical rods  hadley s quadrant 
or inoculation for the smallpox 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                           paris  february 27th  1780 

  sir 

there are so many gentlemen of rank going out to america  that there
can be no doubt congress will be fully informed of the state of public
affairs 

mr lee  mr izard  the marquis de lafayette  mr wharton  and many
others  are going by different vessels  besides these  monsieur de
l etombe  who is appointed consul general of france for the northern
district of america  as m  holker for the middle   i have not yet
learned who for the southern   will go soon 

there is an armament preparing with the greatest expedition at brest 
which is to be commanded by m  de ternay  and to consist of eight or
ten ships of the line and frigates  six of the line and several
frigates  as it is said   perhaps it is not yet certain nor determined
exactly how many of either   with several thousand men  all numbers
are mentioned from six to ten thousand men  under the general officers
de rochambeau and jaucourt  whether this force is destined to the
continent or the west indies  time will discover  at present  it ought
not to be known  on the other hand  i see by a paragraph in a london
paper of the 16th of this month  that the thunderer  torbay  ramilies 
royal oak  triumph  and egmont  are ordered for the west indies  under
captain walsingham  the southampton  st albans  and winchelsea  which
were talked of to go with him  are found unfit for service  and in so
bad a condition as to be ordered to be paid off  thus the french are
likely to be drawn into the american seas in sufficient force  where
they have great advantages in carrying on the war  it is much to be
wished  that the spaniards could be drawn into the same field of
battle  for gibraltar must be taken in america if ever 

there are some persons  however  who think that the english will
avenge the french  the spaniards  and above all the americans  upon
one another  and it is certain that parties in england are working up
to a crisis  the petitions of the counties  their numerous committees
of correspondence  their hints of associations  have most certainly
alarmed the king and his ministers to so great a degree  that for some
time their conduct was equivocal  giving hopes at times to the people 
that the crown would favor the desired reformation in the expenditure
of money  but upon the news of rodney s successes they grew bolder 
and determined to exert all the authority of the crown to suppress the
meetings of the people  accordingly the cry of faction  sedition  and
rebellion  was set up in parliament by the majority  and the king was
advised to dismiss those lieutenants of counties  who had favored the
meetings of the people  advice which he has certainly taken  this is
a decisive measure  it will either discourage and suppress those
meetings  petitions  correspondence  and associations altogether  or
it will give them greater force 

by a debate in the house of commons on the 14th of this month  one
would think that the nation was nearly on the brink of a civil war 
yet  i confess  i cannot think that there are any characters at
present in whom the nation have sufficient confidence  to venture
themselves any lengths under their guidance  and i believe that this
spirited conduct of the king will defeat the measures of the counties 
unless  indeed  in the course of the next campaign  his arms 
especially by sea  should meet with any signal defeat  which would
perhaps reanimate the people  but supposing the people go on and
succeed so far as to effect a change in the ministry  the question is 
whether this would be an advantage to us or our allies  i am myself
very far from being convinced that it would 

there are none of the principal leaders of the people  who avow any
fixed principle  that we can depend upon  none that avow a design of
acknowledging our independence  or even of making peace 

by letters  which i have received from brussels and holland  since my
arrival  i am told that the late desperate step of the english in
seizing the dutch ships has made a great change in the minds of the
people there  and the government too in our favor  even the prince
declares he has been deceived by the english  and that he will promote
unlimited convoys  that an american minister is much wished for  who 
although he might not yet be publicly received  would be able to do as
much good as if he was  that money might be borrowed there by such a
minister directly sent by congress  applying directly to solid dutch
houses  i hope every hour to hear of mr laurens  arrival 

i have subscribed for the english papers  but have not yet received
any  which i am sorry for  because i can get none to enclose  as fast
as they come to me i will send them  i have the honor to enclose
another _mercure de france_ 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

this will be delivered to you by the marquis  your friend  your
grandson is well and very contented  he has seen the world  to be
sure  such a part of it  that none of the rest can ever be
superlatively disagreeable to him hereafter  57 

instead of wishing and hoping for peace  my dear countrymen must
qualify themselves for war  and learn the value of liberty by the
dearness of its purchase  the foundations of lasting prosperity are
laid in great military talents and virtues  every sigh for peace 
until it can be obtained with honor  is unmanly  if our enemies can be
obstinate and desperate in a wicked and disgraceful cause  surely we
can be determined and persevering in the most just  the most
honorable  and the most glorious cause  that was ever undertaken by
men 

  i am  with great affection   c 

                                                           john adams

  sir 

i have this moment received a letter from m  genet  who is one of the
first secretaries in the office of foreign affairs  and who has the
care of publishing all things relative to america  and has already
translated the constitutions of new york  new jersey  pennsylvania 
maryland  virginia  and south carolina  requesting me to assist him in
procuring those of georgia  north carolina  connecticut  rhode island 
massachusetts bay  and new hampshire 

there is so great a curiosity through all europe to see our new
constitutions  and those already published in the languages of europe
have done us so much honor  that i thought i should be excusable in
making a direct request to congress for their assistance in procuring
those  which m  genet still desires 

those of rhode island and connecticut  being according to their
ancient charters  m  genet has already  those of massachusetts and new
hampshire  whenever they shall be formed and established  will be
easily obtained  but those of north carolina and georgia  i could not
obtain when i was at boston  and these are therefore the ones which m 
genet wants at present  and which i have ventured to beg the aid of
congress to procure

will see the news from england and holland

  sir 

the news of the day is  that rodney has gone with his whole fleet to
the west indies  that du chaffault is to command the french fleet in
america  and the count d estaing in the channel  that a large force is
to go to america  either to the islands or to the continent  both of
ships and troops in two divisions  that the last letters from holland
breathe a spirit somewhat warlike  and indeed the english have treated
them with so much indignity and contempt as well as injustice  that
one would think it was not always to be borne 

it is not agreeable to my principles  nor to my feelings  to injure
the character even of an enemy at war  but it is often possible to
draw important inferences from the true known character of a commander
of the forces of an enemy  it is therefore my duty to mention  that
rodney is reported to be a man of dissipation and prodigality  a great
spendthrift  and virulent against us  that he has often declared  that
if he had a command in america  his mode to humiliate and subdue us
should be  to burn every town and every house  that he could come at
upon the seacoast 

that such a plan of military execution will be sooner or later adopted
by the court of london  i have not the least doubt  from their known
principles  tempers  characters  and past conduct  provided it should
ever be in their power to attempt it in the whole or in part  and if
this is the disposition and system of their admiral rodney  the
appointment of him raises a presumption  that they have given him
express orders to this purpose at this time  an uncommon coincidence
of favorable circumstances has thrown the whole caracas fleet into his
hands  and given a victory  although pretty dearly paid for  over a
much inferior fleet of spanish men of war  if he is therefore a man of
such levity as is represented  and so malicious against us  and has
such malignant orders from his court  and goes to america flushed and
giddy with success  we may expect he will do mischief if he can  and
we ought to be upon our guard 

my business is peace  but i think of nothing but war  while our
enemies think of nothing else  we ought not to think more of peace
than to be ready to treat of it  as soon as it shall be put into the
hearts of our foes to be willing for it  americans must be soldiers 
they must war by sea and land  they have no other security 

i have the honor to enclose the gazette of the day  and to be with
much respect   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the _mercure de france_ of this day  which
contains among other interesting intelligence admiral rodney s
narration  after his good fortune on the 8th of january last in
meeting the spanish caracas fleet  which sailed from st sebastian the
1st of january  under convoy of seven armed vessels belonging to the
caracas company  the guipuscoa  of sixtyfour guns  and five hundred
and fifty men  the san carlos  of thirtytwo guns  and two hundred men 
the san raphael  of thirty guns  and one hundred and fiftyfive men 
the santa theresa  of twentyeight guns  and one hundred and fifty
men  the corbetta san firmin  of sixteen guns  and sixty men  these
armed vessels were all taken  and the guipuscoa was christened prince
william  in honor of his royal highness  in whose presence she was
taken and given to one of the english captains  as a better ship than
his former one  the bienfaisant 

the merchant vessels under this convoy are the nostra senora de
l ores  the san francisco  the conception  the san nicholas  the
jeronimo  the divina providentia  the san gibilan  the san pactora 
the san lauren  the bellona  and the esperanza  all loaded with flour
and corn  the cervidada de merica  loaded with provisions for the
navy  the amisted  the san michael  loaded with anchors and cables 
and the bilboa  loaded with tobacco  those with provisions for the
navy  and that with tobacco  were sent to england under convoy of the
america and the pearl  and those with corn and flour were carried into
gibraltar 

this fleet seems to have been met at sea by the admiral by perfect
accident  of which the english do not appear to have had the least
hope  nor the spaniards the smallest fear  it must therefore be
allowed to be one instance of the good fortune of the english ministry
and their admiral  or rather as it is reported  of the king and his
admiral 

their good fortune  however  did not end here  for eight days
afterwards  on the 16th of january  they fell in with don juan de
langura  with eleven vessels of the line  who being so much inferior 
could not hope for a victory  he fought the english  however  upon the
retreat with so much bravery  skill  and success  that they were able
to take only three of his ships  the phoenix  of eighty guns  and the
princessa  and diligent  of seventyfour  were taken  and the san
domingo blown up  the s  genero  the s  justo  and the monarcha 
having separated before the battle  and the s  juliano  the s 
eugenio  the s  augustine  and s  lorenzo  having since arrived in
cadiz  although in a bad condition 

thus the english have been permitted  against probabilities and
appearances  to throw succor into gibraltar  and perhaps mahon  to
give a little fresh confidence to the ministry  and make a few
bonfires for the populace  but have added very little to their riches
or their power  in the meantime  rodney must have been retarded by
these lucky accidents  in his course to the west indies  and given
opportunity to the count de guichen to arrive before him in the west
indies  and prevent the reconquest of the grenadas  and perhaps do
more  but of this congress will be informed sooner than i 

these successes have not suppressed the independent spirit of ireland 
which is going on in a regular train  deliberating upon bills for the
independence of the judges  the habeas corpus  the restriction  of
subsidies  and discipline of their troops  and they seem determined to
throw off all the authority of the british parliament  nor that of the
committees of correspondence and petitioners in the counties of
england  which threaten associations  and  as the ministry themselves
say  sedition  faction  tumults  and rebellion  nor provided a fleet
for the british channel for the ensuing summer  nor assuaged the
serious resentment of holland  for the piracies committed in violation
of the faith of treaties  as well as the laws of nature and nations 
upon their commerce  as it is most interesting to us to know the
forces to be employed in america  by which word i comprehend the west
india islands  as well as the coasts of the continent  all these being
connected together in such a manner as to make but one whole  i beg
leave to lay before congress in one view  the french force that is
intended to be in that service 

there are actually at cape françois  the touant of eightyfour guns 
the robuste  and the fendant  of seventyfour  the sphinx of sixtyfour 
and the amphion of fifty  in all five  at martinique  the admirable 
the magnifique  the dauphin royal  and the diadème  of seventyfour 
the réfléchi  the vengeur  the artisane  of sixtyfour  and the fiers
of fifty  in all eight  making in the whole thirteen ships of the
line  reckoning as such two fiftys  if the count de guichen should
happily arrive  he has seventeen  which will amount to the number of
thirty  besides frigates  six others are preparing at brest with all
possible expedition  under the command of m  de ternay  the duc de
burgone of eighty guns  the neptune of seventyfour  m  destouches  the
magnanime of seventyfour  m  de vaudreuil  the eveille of sixtyfour 
m  de trobuiand  the jason of sixtyfour  m  de marigny  with this
fleet the troops are to be embarked  and there are many conjectures 
that it is intended for north america  the languedoc  the cæsar  the
provence  and the fantasque  of the fleet of the count d estaing  are
careened and refitted  and the royal louis of one hundred and ten
guns  the northumberland  and the astrea are to be launched
immediately 

in the course of my peregrinations  at brest  l orient  and ferrol  i
have had an opportunity to see most of these ships  and to be on board
many of them  and one would think there was force enough to protect
us  and quiet our fears  but the battle is not always to the strong 
and we must wait patiently for time to decide events 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

this will be delivered to you by mr izard  who goes out in the
alliance with mr lee  mr wharton  mr brown  and others  he will wait
on you of course  and will be able to give you good information
concerning the intentions of the english  and their military
preparations by sea and land  and those of the french and spaniards 
at the same time  he will also give his opinion very freely concerning
american and other characters here  as well as measures 

in many things his opinions may be just  but in some and those not a
few  i am sure they are wrong  the great principle  in which i have
differed from him  is this  in the mode of treating with this court 
he has been always of opinion  that it was good policy and necessary
to hold a high language to this court  to represent to them the danger
of our being subdued  if they did not do this and the other thing for
us  in order to obtain money and other aids from them  he is confident
they would not have dared to refuse anything 

although no man in america  or in the world  was earlier convinced
than i was  that it was the interest of france and spain to support
the independence of america  and that they would support it  and that
no man is more sensible than i am of the necessity they are under to
support us  yet i am not  nor ever was  of opinion  that we could
with truth or with good policy assume the style of menace  and
threaten them with returning again to great britain  and joining
against france and spain  even telling them that we should be subdued 
because i never believed this myself  and the court here would not
have believed it from us  the court have many difficulties to manage 
as well as we  and it is delicate and hazardous to push things in this
country  things are not to be negotiated here as they are with the
people of america  even with the tories in america  or as with the
people of england  there is a frankness  however  that ought to be
used with the ministry  and a candor with which the truth may be and
has been communicated  but there is a harshness  that would not fail
to ruin  in my opinion  the fairest negotiation in this country 

we are anxious to hear from you  having nothing since the beginning of
december  and very little since we left you 

  your friend and servant

  sir 

yesterday i went to court  in company with the american minister
plenipotentiary  and had the honor to be presented to the king  by the
secretary of state for foreign affairs  after which  i had the honor
to go round with all the foreign ambassadors  and make a visit to the
queen  the king s brothers  sister  aunts  and daughters  which are
all the branches of the royal family  and to be presented to each of
them in turn  and after them to the count de maurepas 

after these ceremonies were over  we were all invited to dine with the
count de vergennes 

as ceremonies of this kind are so much attended to in this and all
other countries of europe  and have often such important effects  it
is proper that congress should have information of them 

i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress the gazettes of france  of the
hague  and amsterdam  of the 1st  3d  and 4th of this month  they
contain all the news  which makes the subject of conversation at this
time  except that m  du chaffault is to command in the west indies 
and the count d estaing in the channel  which  although it is not
announced by the court  seems to be very generally believed in the
world

  sir 

enclosed are the _courrier de l europe_  of the 3d  and the _gazette
de france_ of this day  the house of lords and the house of commons
are voting thanks to admiral rodney for his good fortune  for they all
seem to confess  that his brilliant successes were not owing to more
skill  valor  or vigilance than others have shown  but merely to his
good luck  which  by a report that spreads and gains credit today  did
not end with his advantage over langara  and his safe departure from
gibraltar  it is said that two french ships of the line and several
frigates with transports  bound to the isle of france  in the east
indies  have been doomed to fall in his way  and be taken 

whether this is true or not  he has done enough it seems to be in a
fair way of paying his creditors some part of their demands for money 
which he has gambled away  and which they had despaired of ever
receiving  this run of good luck  however  could never have happened
to the gambler  if the game had been played otherwise by the opposite
party  if france and spain  instead of keeping immense fleets in
europe with nothing to do  or employed in blocking up gibraltar  which
is a trifle  if taken in comparison of other objects in view  had but
employed but a fourth part of them in the american seas  where they
had  and still have  the enemies in their power  rodney s creditors
had still been in despair  together with the british government and
nation 

i would not desire a better proof  that the english are in the power
of their enemies in the american world  than the list of the prizes
printed in the _courrier de l europe_  as condemned by n  cushing 
judge of admiralty for the middle district of massachusetts bay  i am
very glad to see this method taken of publishing to the world the
success of our privateers  because it will in time show our allies
where our strength lies  and the weakness of our enemies 

  i have the honor to be   c

                    to the president of congress 

                                              paris  march 12th  1780 

  sir 

it is an observation made some years ago by a great writer of this
nation  de mably  that the project of being sole master of the sea 
and of commanding all the commerce  is not less chimerical nor less
ruinous  than that of universal monarchy on land  and it is to be
wished  for the happiness of europe  that the english may be convinced
of this truth  before they shall learn it by their own experience 
france has already repeated several times  that it was necessary to
establish an equilibrium  a balance of power at sea  and she has not
yet convinced anybody  because she is the dominant power  and because
they suspect her to desire the abasement of the english  only that she
may domineer the more surely on the continent  but if england abuses
her power  and would exercise a kind of tyranny over commerce 
presently all the states that have vessels and sailors  astonished
that they had not before believed france  will join themselves to her
in avenging her injuries 

the present conjuncture of affairs resembles so exactly the case here
put  that it seems to be a literal fulfilment of a prophecy 

a domination upon the sea is so much the more dangerous to other
maritime powers and commercial nations  as it is more difficult to
form alliances and combine forces at sea than at land  for which
reason it is essential  that the sovereign of every commercial state
should make his nation s flag respected in all the seas  and by all
the nations of the world  the english have ever acted upon this
principle  in supporting the honor of their own flag  but of late
years have grown less and less attentive to it  as it respects the
honor of other flags  not content with making their flag respectable 
they have grown more and more ambitious of making it terrible 
unwilling to do as they would be done by  and to treat other
commercial nations as they have insisted upon being treated by them 
they have grown continually more and more haughty  turbulent  and
insolent upon the seas  and are now never satisfied until they have
made all other nations see  that they despise them upon that element 
it is said by the baron de bielfield  that piracies and robberies at
sea are so odious  so atrocious  and so destructive to the interest of
all the european nations  that everything is permitted to repress
them  providence has not granted to any people an exclusive empire
upon the seas  to aim at setting up a master there  to prescribe laws
to other free nations  is an outrage to all europe 

i have quoted these authorities  because they contain the true
principle  upon which as i have ever conceived  the english began this
war  and upon which they will assuredly continue it  as long as they
can get men and money  which will be as long as they have success 
they contain also the true principles of france  spain  and holland 
and all the powers of europe  the outrages committed upon the dutch
commerce  and the insults offered to their flag  ought to be  and are 
alarming to all the maritime powers  the late successes of the english
will have no tendency to allay the fears of these powers  on the
contrary they will increase the alarm  by showing the precarious
situation they will all be in if england should finally succeed  which
some of them may perhaps apprehend from the late brilliant fortune of
admiral rodney 

one cannot but be struck with the rapid series of fortunate incidents
for the english  which have been published here in about the course of
three months  that i have been in europe  the little affair of omoa
began it  the repulse at savannah succeeded  with all its
consequences  the curraçoa fleet was next  langara s fleet soon
followed  gibraltar was relieved  don gaston s squadron was dispersed
by a storm  and admiral rodney had opportunity to get safe out of
gibraltar  the french east india fleet brings up the rear  there is
hardly in history such a series of events  that no human wisdom could
provide against or foresee  yet after all  the advantages gained are
by no means decisive  although no doubt it will raise the ambition of
the english  and in some degree damp the ardor of their enemies 

it must not have this effect however upon america  let the maritime
powers fare as they will  we must be free  and i trust in god we shall
be so  whatever be their fate  the events of war are uncertain at sea 
more than even by land  but america has resources for the final
defence of her liberty  which britain will never be able to exhaust 
though she should exhaust france and spain  and it may not impossibly
be our hard fate  but it will be our unfading glory finally to turn
the scale of the war  to humble the pride  which is so terrible to the
commercial nations of europe  and to produce a balance of power on the
seas  to this end americans must be soldiers and seamen 

it is proper  however  to keep constantly in sight  the power against
which we have to contend  the english have in all the ports of
england  in a condition for actual service  or at least given out and
reported to be so  twenty ships of the line  in the course of the
spring and the month of june  eight others which are now repairing 
and three new ones in the course of the year  the whole squadron for
the channel will be thirtyone  the squadron of arbuthnot  at new york 
consists of five  that of jarvis at the western islands is two 
including the dublin  which was detached from admiral rodney  and is
now in bad condition at lisbon  one only at jamaica  for the lion is
too far ruined to be counted  the fleet at the other islands  joined
by the hector  detached from rodney  the triumph and the intrepid 
lately sailed from england  are nineteen  seven of which at least are
in too bad a condition for actual service  that of india  including
two which serve for convoys  consists of ten  two of which however are
returning to be repaired or condemned  the lenox is a guard ship in
ireland 

rodney entered gibraltar with four spanish ships of the line  the
phoenix of eighty guns  the monarca  the princessa  and the diligente
of seventy  besides the guipuscoa  now the prince william  of
sixtyfive  which he took with the convoy on the 8th of january  he
entered  also  with the shrewsbury of seventyfour  which joined him
from lisbon  his squadron must therefore have consisted of twentyfour
ships of the line  if he left the panther and another at gibraltar  he
must have gone out with twentytwo 

whether he has gone with the whole fleet to the west indies  or
whether with part of it  and what part  is yet undetermined by the
public 

france and spain  however  have a vast superiority still remaining 
which  if it should be ably managed  will easily humble the english 
but if it should be unwisely managed  or continue to be as unfortunate
as it has been from the moment of the count d estaing s sailing from
toulon  it will even in this case last long enough to consume and
exhaust their enemies

  dear sir 

i have to acknowledge the receipt of three excellent letters  one of
the 1st  the others of the 5th and 8th of march  i thank you for the
copy of your letter to the pensioner  and for your dialogue between
york and chatham 

it is undoubtedly the duty of every commercial nation  to make their
flag respected in all the seas  and by all the nations  not by
insulting and injuring all others  like great britain  but by doing
justice to all others  and by insisting upon justice from them  but
how is holland to obtain justice from the english  who take a manifest
pleasure and pride in showing her and all europe  that they despise
her  holland seems to be as corrupted and unprincipled as great
britain  but there is one great difference between them  great britain
has a terrible naval force  holland has next to none  great britain
has courage and confidence in her power  holland has none  i do not
mean that the dutch are destitute of personal courage  but national
courage is a very different thing 

the curious doctrine of a constitutional impossibility of
acknowledging our independence is well exposed in your dialogue  i
suppose the idea was taken from lord chatham s dying speech  when he
conjured up the ghost of the princess sophia of hanover  to whose
posterity  being protestants  the act of settlement had consecrated
the succession of the crown and its authority over all parts of the
dominions  this was a masterly stroke of oratory  to be sure  and
shows  that my lord chatham in his last moments had not lost the
knowledge of the prejudices in the character of the english nation 
nor the arts of popularity  but a more manifest address to the
passions and prejudices of the populace  without the least attention
to the justice or policy of the principle  never fell from a popular
orator  ancient or modern  could my lord chatham contend  that the
heirs of the princess sophia of hanover  provided they should be
protestants  had the throne and its prerogatives entailed upon them 
to everlasting ages  over all parts of the british dominions  let them
do what they would  govern without parliament  by laws without law 
dismiss judges without fault  suspend laws  in short do everything
that the stewarts did  and ten times more  yet so long as they were
protestants  could there be no resistance to their will  and no
forfeiture of their right to govern  i said this was a figure of
rhetoric  employed by his lordship _ad captandum vulgus_  i believe so
still  but i believe he meant it also _ad captandum regem_  and that
he thought  by throwing out this idea  that he was not for
acknowledging our independence  the king  who at that time was
distressed for a minister able in conducting a war  would call him
into the ministry  i ever lamented this black spot in a very bright
character  i do not remember anything in his lordship s conduct  which
seemed to me so suspicious to have proceeded from a perverted heart as
this flight  allowance  however  ought to be made  perhaps he was
misunderstood  and would have explained himself fairly if he had
lived 

i have not seen the pamphlet entitled _facts_  nor that by lloyd  nor
the _examen_  i should be glad to see all of them  i find a difficulty
in getting pamphlets from england  but i shall have a channel to
obtain them by and by  i went to mr grant s as soon as i received
yours of the 8th  mr grant the father was out  and no other in the
house knew anything of your letter  or maps  or other things  i will
speak to the father the first opportunity  mr lee is gone to l orient 

what think you of luck  had any gambler ever so much as rodney  one of
our tories in boston  or half way whigs  told me once  god loves that
little island of old england  and the people that live upon it  i
suppose he would say now  god loves rodney  i do not draw the same
conclusion from the successes  that the island or the hero have had 
who can be persuaded to believe  that he loves so degenerate and
profligate a race  i think it more probable  that heaven has permitted
this series of good fortune to attend the wicked  that the righteous
americans may reflect in time  and place their confidence in their own
patience  fortitude  perseverance  political wisdom  and military
talents  under the protection and blessing of his providence 

there are those who believe  that if france and spain had not
interposed  america would have been crushed  there are in other parts
of europe  i am told  a greater number who believe  that if it had not
been for the interposition of france and spain  american independence
would have been acknowledged by great britain a year or two ago  i
believe neither the one nor the other  i know the deep roots of
american independence on one side of the water  and i know the deep
roots of the aversion to it on the other  if it was rational to
suppose  that the english should succeed in their design  and endeavor
to destroy the fleets and naval power of france and spain  which they
are determined to do if they can  what would be the consequence  there
are long lists of french and spanish ships of the line yet to be
destroyed  which would cost the english several campaigns and a long
roll of millions  and after this they may send sixty thousand men to
america  if they can get them  and what then  why  the glory of
baffling  exhausting  beating  and taking them  will finally be that
of the american yeomanry  whose numbers have increased every year
since this war began  as i learnt with certainty in my late visit
home  and will increase every year  in spite of all the art  malice 
skill  valor  and activity of the english and all their allies  i
hope  however  that the capricious goddess will bestow some of her
favors upon france and spain  and a very few of them would do the
work  if rodney s fortune should convince spain  that she is attacking
the bull by the horns  and france and spain  that the true system for
conducting this war  is by keeping just force enough in the channel to
protect their coasts and their trade  and by sending all the rest of
their ships into the american seas  it will be the best fortune for
the allies they ever had 

i long to learn mr jay s success at madrid  and mr laurens  arrival in
holland  where i will go to see him some time in the summer or autumn 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

by a letter from london of the 3d of this month  received since my
former of this day s date  i learn that the friends of the ministry
were in hopes every hour to hear that clinton  who embarked seven
thousand effective men   though they are said to be ten  in the latter
end of december  is in possession of charleston  the detachment
consisted of the light infantry and grenadiers of the seventh 
twentythird  thirtythird  fortysecond  sixtythird  and sixtyfourth
british regiments  a legion of horse  yagers  four battalions of
hessian grenadiers  the new york volunteers  ferguson s corps  one
hessian regiment  and a detachment of the seventyfirst british
regiment  many are of opinion that a part of this army was intended
for the windward islands  and that they embarked and sailed the 26th
of december  and was much hurt by a storm after sailing  two thousand 
under lord cornwallis  were said to be intended for the chesapeake  to
burn two or three men of war in james river  and to serve as a
division to the other five  going against charleston 

the friends of the administration are not in spirits about the picture
of affairs in america and the west indies  they fear the french will
have a superiority there  from whence some late accounts are arrived
of vast sickness and disorder on board the english ships  the naval
war will  to appearance  be removed for the next summer to that
quarter  rodney was to sail with four ships only to the west indies 
and walsingham will not take more than that number as a convoy to
about one hundred west indiamen  which were to sail about the 20th of
this month  and more ships of war would probably conduct this fleet
off the land  and it was probable in the new york and quebec trade
about fifty vessels more would sail about the same time  that there
was no talk of any troops or ships going to new york or quebec  that
there was a rumor that wallace would have a small squadron  and carry
four or five thousand men out  but this was not believed  that the
ministry had been hard pressed in several parliamentary questions
lately  that their party was losing ground daily  that the county
petitions for reformation were a heavy weight upon them  that it was
likely there would be serious disturbances  if reforms do not take
place  that the committees for each county have already appointed
three deputies to meet and act for the whole  which is the beginning
of a congress  and will probably be soon called by that name  that it
was hard to determine whether these movements at home  or the
proceedings in ireland  chagrin the ministry most  that the
sovereignty of england over ireland will not be of many month s
duration  that the armed associations in the latter amount to
sixtyfour thousand men  who seem determined to free themselves from
every restriction that has been laid on them  that their parliament is
about putting an end to all appeals to england  to render the judges
independent of the crown  they at present holding their offices
_durante bene placito_  and not _quamdiu se bene gesserunt_  as in
england  to have a habeas corpus act  to repeal poyning s law  which
enacts that all bills shall originate in the council and not in the
commons  to confine the new supplies to the appointment of new duties
only  to give bounties on their own manufactures  and to have a mutiny
bill  which last goes immediately to the grand point of jurisdiction 

that  however  notwithstanding all the present appearances against
great britain  and the certainty of america s succeeding to her wish 
there are not among even those  who are called patriots in parliament 
many who possess directly a wish for american independence  that lords
camden  effingham  coventry  and the bishop of st asaph are clearly
and distinctly for it  sir g  saville  and but a few others in the
house of commons  that the rest of the patriots are for sovereignty 
america to give up the french alliance  make up a federal alliance
with england  by which no doubt they mean an alliance offensive and
defensive   c 

it is surely unnecessary for me to make any observations upon the
absurdity of these provisos  so injurious to the honor of our country 
and so destructive of her most essential rights and interests  by a
letter of the 7th  a vessel with two hundred hessians or yagers on
board has arrived at st ives  in cornwall  she sailed with the
expedition from new york  the 26th of december  and a few days after
received much damage in a storm  which it is thought separated and
dispersed the fleet  this gives us great spirits and sanguine hopes
for charleston  i have the honor to enclose several newspapers  and 
with much respect  to be   c

  sir 

i have taken some pains to inform myself what number of regular troops
the enemy have in the three kingdoms  because we may form some
judgment from this  whether they will be able to send any  and what
reinforcements to north america or the west indies  i am assured  that
they have not more than four thousand regular troops in ireland  and
these chiefly horse  it is not to be expected then  i think  that they
can spare any of these  there is too much danger even of popular
commotions in england  scotland  and ireland  to spare many of these 
if they were perfectly safe  or thought themselves so from french and
spanish invasions  i have  however  written to obtain more exact and
authentic information  which i will not fail to transmit as early as
possible 

i have received an account at length  both by the gazette
extraordinary  and by letter from london  that admiral digby is
returned with the fleet and spanish prizes from gibraltar  and brought
in with him the protée  a french sixtyfour gun ship  and three small
store ships  part of a fleet bound from l orient to the east indies 
the sixtyfour gun ship had about sixtythree thousand pounds in cash on
board  this fleet was unlucky enough to fall in with digby on the 23d
of february  rodney sailed from gibraltar on the 14th  and parted with
digby on the 18th  taking only four ships of the line with him to the
west indies  a like number will probably go under walsingham about the
20th or 25th of this month  with the fleet to the west indies  it is
said in letters from london  that by every appearance  there are no
more troops going to north america  and that it looks as if the
ministry mean not to continue the american war  but to let it dwindle
and die away  if this should be the case  it is to be hoped that the
americans and their allies will not let it dwindle  but put it to
death at a blow 

the marquis de lafayette  and his brother the viscount de noailles  a
young noble officer  who is worthy of his family  and of the relation
he bears to the marquis  who i hope will be the bearer of this letter 
will be able to say more upon this head  at present the king and his
general are the only persons  who ought to know the secret 

  i have the honor to be   c

  dear sir 

i have received  since my arrival here  your favor of the 16th of
november  1779  i shall take proper notice of your remarks upon the
13th and 19th articles of the treaty  they are both of them of
importance  and  as to the last  i wish for an instruction upon it 
because there is no doubt to be made  that whenever a serious
negotiation shall be commenced  great pains will be taken for the
banished  although little attention is paid to them now  i learned
yesterday  that they have received no payment of their pensions these
eighteen months  the delay is colored with a pretence of waiting for
some funds for quebec  which have been stopped by the interruption of
that trade  they are still bitter  as i am told  and are firmly
persuaded  that america cannot hold out six months longer 

you assure me  that i shall not be without the orders and credit 
which i mentioned in a letter of mine  i thank you for this assurance 
which is conceived in such strong terms  that one would think you did
not expect any opposition to it  at least  an effectual opposition  i
wish there may not be  but i am not without conjectures  i will not
call them suspicions  upon this head  denying them  however  would be
virtually recalling me and mr dana  and in a manner the most
humiliating and disgraceful  indeed  i do not know how we should get
away from our creditors  you know what sort of minds cannot bear a
brother near the throne  and so fair  so just  so economical a method 
would not escape minds of so much penetration  as a refusal to lend
money without orders  i am not sure  however  that the measure would
be hazarded in the present circumstances  by persons by whom i have
been treated politely enough since my return 

i should be glad to know what the board of treasury have done with my
accounts  whether they have passed upon them  or whether there are any
objections to them  and what they are  i do not know but i was
indiscreet in sending all my original vouchers  because  if any of
them should be lost  i might be puzzled to explain some things 
however  i know by a letter from mr gerry  that they were received 
and i presume they will be preserved 

i wish to know your private opinion  whether congress will continue mr
dana and me here  at so much expense  with so little prospect of
having anything to do for a long time  an uncertain time  however  or 
whether they will revoke our powers  and recall us  or what they will
do with us  a situation so idle and inactive is not agreeable to my
genius  yet i can submit to it as well as any man  if it be thought
necessary for the public good  i will do all the service i can  by
transmitting intelligence  and in every other way 

you must have observed  that in all my public letters  and  indeed  in
a great measure in my private ones  i have cautiously avoided giving
accounts of the state of our affairs in france  i had many reasons for
this caution  in general  i was sure it would do no good  and i
doubted the propriety of stating facts  and remarking upon characters 
without giving notice of it to the persons concerned  and transmitting
the evidence  there is no end of conceiving jealousies  but  i am
sure  that officers of government  especially foreign ministers  ought
not to attack and accuse one another upon jealousies  nor without full
proof  nor then  without notifying the party to answer for himself 

thus much let me say  however  that the present plan of having a
distinct minister in spain  another in holland  and another to treat
with great britain  and having secretaries independent of ministers 
is a good one  i pray you to stand by it with the utmost firmness  if
it should be attacked or undermined  if you revoke the powers of a
separate minister to treat with the king of great britain  you ought
to revoke the former powers of treating with all the courts of europe 
which were given to the commissioners at passy  for  under these 
authority will be claimed of treating with the english  if my powers
are revoked  the powers of treating with all other courts ought to be
separated from the mission

  sir 

we have this moment the news of the arrival of the convoy from st
domingo  with sixty sail of merchant vessels  which is a great event
for this country 

it is also reported  that ten sail of spanish ships of the line  with
ten battalions of land forces have sailed  and their destination is
supposed to be north america 

the armament preparing at brest  is thus described in one of the
public papers  the count du chaffault de besné  lieutenant general of
the naval forces in france  has taken leave of the king  being
presented to his majesty by m  de sartine  the report runs  that
orders have been sent on the 29th of february  for the officers who
are at paris to join their regiments upon the coasts by the 15th of
march  and that eight regiments are to embark under the count de
rochambeau  these regiments are that of _anhalt_  whereof the marquis
de bergen is colonel in second  _auvergne_  colonel commandant  the
viscount de lavel  _bourbonnois_  colonel commandant  the marquis de
laval  and in second  the viscount de rochambeau  _neustrie_  colonel
commandant  the count de guibert  and in second  the viscount le
veneur  _romergne_  colonel commandant  the viscount de custine  and
in second  the marquis du ludec  _royal corse_  colonel commandant 
the marquis du luc  and in second  the count of pontevez  _royal deux
ponts_  colonel commandant  the count aux ponts  _saintongé_  colonel
commandant  the viscount de beranger  and in second  the marquis de
themines  it is asserted  that there will be added a detachment of
artillery  and that the baron de viomenil  the count de chastellux 
and the count de witgenstein will embark with these troops  and that
the duc de lazun will have the command of a body of twelve hundred
volunteers  and be joined to the armament under the count de
rochambeau  all these troops  as it is believed  will embark at brest 
and go out under the convoy of the count du chaffault de besné 

they add  that he will have more than thirtyseven ships of the line
under his command  destined for an expedition  whereof the genuine
object is yet unknown  many other regiments have also orders to march
down nearer to those upon the seacoast  and there are many vessels
taken upon freight for the service of the king  in the different ports
of the kingdom  the freight at havre is thirty livres a ton  on
condition that the owner furnish his vessel for twelve months  they
say the prince de condé will go and command upon the coast of brittany
with the count de vaux 

by a letter i just now received from holland  i am told that the grand
business is done between the northern powers on a footing very
convenient for holland  as it must compel the english to cease
interrupting the trade of the neutral powers  this would be more
beneficial to france and spain than to holland  by facilitating the
acquisition of ship timber  hemp  and all other things for the supply
of their arsenals of the marine  a principal branch of the british
policy has ever been  to prevent the growth of the navies of their
enemies  by intercepting their supplies 

what gives further countenance to this letter  and the reports to the
same purpose  which have been sometime circulated  is an article in
the _mercure de france_  enclosed  they talk of an alliance between
sweden  denmark  russia  prussia  and the united province  for
maintaining the honor of the flags of these powers  congress will see
also another paragraph from london  which favors this idea  that the
baron de nolker  envoy extraordinary from sweden  had declared that if
the convoy of his nation was not released forthwith  with an
indemnification for expenses and losses  he had orders to quit the
court of london in twenty four hours 

some other paragraphs seem to show the dutch in earnest about
equipping a respectable naval force of fiftytwo vessels 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                              paris  march 19th  1780 

  sir 

enclosed is a paper of the 10th of march  which was accidentally
omitted to be enclosed in the season of it 

there are two articles of intelligence  which ought not to escape our
observation  because they have relation to the armament equipping at
brest  although i do not suppose them of much consequence  the first
is of a small squadron of frigates  which is said to have sailed from
portsmouth on the 28th of february  in consequence of orders sent from
the admiralty on the 22d  under the command of captain marshall  who
is on board the emerald  of thirtytwo guns  the others are the hussar
of thirtytwo  the surprise of twentyeight  the squirrel  and heart of
oak of twenty  the sloops  the beaver s prize of fourteen  the wolf 
and the wasp of eight  with the cutters  the nimble and the griffin 
it is thought  that this little squadron is gone to make a cruise on
the coast of france  to hinder the transports assembled in different
ports from going out  or even to destroy them  if that shall be found
to be possible  there is not  however  much to be dreaded from this
squadron so near the neighborhood of brest 

the other paragraph discovers the marks of more ingenuity and less
truth  it is taken from the english papers  that captain jarvis  in
the foudroyant of eighty guns  who has been out upon a cruise  with a
small division in the mouth of the channel  has returned to plymouth
and gone to court  to be himself the bearer to government of
despatches of great importance  from the court of france to congress 
found on board a sloop  which on her passage to philadelphia fell into
his hands  it is asserted  that these despatches contain an ample
detail of the operations concerted between the court of versailles and
dr franklin  among which the most probable is  the project of
attacking halifax  which is to be made by a body of troops from new
england  and by a detachment of french troops very considerable by sea
and land 

this moment a letter from london of the 10th of march informs me  that
a packet boat is arrived from jamaica  which sailed the 29th of
january  with accounts  that fort omoa is again in possession of
spain  that an english man of war has taken a spanish ship of war 
bound to south america with stores  she was pierced for sixtyfour  but
earned only fiftytwo guns  the jamaica fleet sailed on the 24th of
january  convoyed slightly  with two fiftys and two frigates  about
forty merchantmen in all  nothing yet from america  but it is
generally believed  that a storm has separated and dispersed
clinton s fleet  intended for the southern expedition 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                              paris  march 20th  1780 

  sir 

i have at length received a parcel of english papers  which i have the
honor to enclose with this to congress  they are the general
advertiser  and the morning post  both of which i shall for the future
be able to transmit regularly every week  congress will see that these
papers are of opposite parties  one being manifestly devoted to the
court and the ministry  and the majority  the other to the opposition 
the committees  the associations  and petitions  between both i hope
congress will be informed of the true facts 

there is the appearance of a piquancy and keenness in the temper of
the opposite parties  by their writings and paragraphs in these
papers  that looks like the commencement of a serious quarrel 

by the violence of the manner in which such characters as keppel 
howe  burgoyne  richmond  shelburne  rockingham   c  are treated  it
should seem  that the ministry were exasperated to a greater degree of
rancor than ever  and that they were thoroughly alarmed and determined
to throw the last die  time and the events of war will decide what
will be the consequences of these heated passions 

by a conversation this morning with the viscount de noailles  i am led
to fear  that the fleet from brest will not be able to put to sea
before the 10th of april  this will be about the time the marquis de
lafayette will arrive in america  he sailed from rochelle the 13th of
this month 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

in the letter  which you did me the honor to write me on the 24th of
february  your excellency proposed  that the principal object of my
mission should be inserted in the gazette of france  when it should
make mention of my presentation to the king and all the royal family 

in the answer to this letter  which i had the honor to write on the
25th of february  i informed your excellency  that i should not think
myself at liberty to make any publication of my powers to treat of
peace  until they should have been announced in the gazette  it was on
the 7th of march  that i had the honor to be presented to the king and
royal family  but no notice has been taken of it in the gazette of
france  whether the omission is accidental  or whether it is owing to
any alteration in your excellency s sentiments  i am not able to
determine 

your excellency will excuse the trouble i give you on this occasion 
as it arises wholly from a desire to be able at all times  to render
an account to my sovereign of the motives and reasons of my own
conduct 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                              paris  march 21st  1780 

  dear sir 

i have just received your favor from brussels of the 17th of this
month  and i thank you for this instance of your attention to me 

considering the state of ireland  and the spirit that seems to be
rising in england  which has already attained such a height  as to
baffle the minister  and the east india company  and to carry many
votes in the house of commons  almost to a balance with him  and even
some against him  i should not be at all surprised  if terms  such as
you mention  should be offered to america  nor should i be surprised
if another rumor  which was propagated at the palais royal this day 
should prove true  that a great change is made or to be made in the
ministry  and that the lords shelburne and rockingham  burke   c  are
in  yet i have no proper accounts of either 

whatever may be my powers or instructions  or whether i have any or
not  i am very much obliged to you for your sentiments on such a
proposition as a truce for america  supposing it should be made  your
arguments are of great weight  and will undoubtedly be attended to by
every one  whoever he may be  who shall be called to give an opinion
upon such a great question  you will not expect me at present to give 
if it is proper for me even to form  any decided opinion upon it  yet
thus much i may venture to say  that having had so long an experience
of the policy of our enemies  i am persuaded  from the whole of it  if
they propose a truce  it will not be with an expectation or desire 
that america should accept it  but merely to try one experiment more
to deceive  divide  and seduce  in order to govern 

you observe  that the heads of some well intentioned  though visionary
americans  run much upon a truce  i have seen and heard enough to be
long since convinced  that the americans in europe are by no means an
adequate representation of those on the other side of the water  they
neither feel  nor reason like them in general  i should  therefore 
upon all occasions hear their arguments with attention  weigh them
with care  but be sure never to follow them  when i knew them to
differ from the body of their countrymen at home 

you say the dutch are disturbed  do you wonder at it  they have been
kicked by the english  as no reasonable man would kick a dog  they
have been whipped by them  as no sober postillion would whip a hackney
coach horse  can they submit to all this  upon any principle  which
would not oblige them to submit  if the english were to bombard
amsterdam  or cut away their dikes 

i wish i knew the name of the principal confident and director of the
prince  whom you mention 

i am very anxious to hear of the arrival of mr laurens  but suspect
you will learn it first  mr dana returns his respects to you 

i thank you  sir  for your offers of service  nothing can oblige me
more than to communicate to me any intelligence of the designs of our
enemies  in politics or war  and their real and pretended forces by
sea and land  pray what is the foundation of the story of a quintuple
alliance between holland  sweden  russia  prussia  and denmark 

i am  sir  with great esteem  your humble servant

                                               paris  march 23d  1780 

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose the english papers of the 11th  13th  and
14th of march  the _courrier de l europe_  and the hague  leyden  and
amsterdam gazettes  we are in hourly expectation of great news from
holland  ireland  england  spain  and above all from america  and the
west indies  i have not had a letter from america since i left it 
except one from my family of the 10th of december  and  indeed 
although several vessels have arrived  i can hear of no letters or
news 

by the english papers congress will perceive the violent fermentation
in england  which has arisen to such a height as to produce a congress
in fact  and it will soon be so in name  the proceedings in the house
of commons on the 14th  which were terminated by a resolution of the
committee of the whole house  to abolish the board of trade and
plantations  carried against the ministry after a very long and warm
debate  by a majority of eight voices  is not only the most
extraordinary vote  which has passed in the present reign  but it
tends to very extensive consequences 

i believe it is very true  that this board has been the true cause of
the quarrel of great britain against the colonies  and therefore may
be considered as an object of national resentment  but a resentment of
this kind alone would not probably have produced this effect 

whether it is the near approach of an election  that has intimidated
the members of the house of commons  or whether committees  petitions 
associations  and congress have alarmed them  or whether the nation
is convinced  that america is indeed lost forever  and consequently
the board of trade would be useless  i do not know  be this as it may 
the english nation  and even the irish and scotch nations  and all
parts of the world will draw this inference from it  that even in the
opinion of the house of commons america is lost  the free and virtuous
citizens of america  and even the slavish and vicious  if there are
any still remaining of this character  under the denomination of
tories  must be convinced by this vote  passed in the hey day of their
joy for the successes of admiral rodney s fleet  that the house of
commons despaired of ever regaining america  the nations subject to
the house of bourbon cannot fail to put the same interpretation upon
this transaction 

holland and all the northern powers  with the empress of russia at
their head  who are all greatly irritated against england for their
late violences against the innocent commerce of neutral powers  will
draw the same consequences  the politicians of great britain are too
enlightened in the history of nations  and the rise and progress of
causes and effects in the political world  not to see  that all these
bodies of people will  in consequence of this vote  consider the
colonies given up as lost by the house of commons  and they are too
well instructed  not to know the important consequences that follow 
from having such points as those thus settled among the nations  i
cannot  therefore  but consider this vote  and the other respecting
the secretary of state for the american department  which arose almost
to a balance  as a decided declaration of the sense of the nation  the
first consequence of it probably will be one further attempt  by
offering some specious terms  which they know we cannot in justice 
in honor  in conscience  accept  to deceive  seduce  and divide
america  throw all into confusion there  and by this means gaining an
opportunity to govern  there is nothing more astonishing than the
inconsistencies of the patriots in england  those  who are most
violent against the ministry  are not for making peace with france and
spain  but they would wish to allure america into a separate peace 
and persuade her to join them against the house of bourbon  one would
think it impossible  that one man of sense in the world could
seriously believe  that we could thus basely violate our truth  thus
unreasonably quarrel with our best friends  thus madly attach
ourselves to our belligerent enemies  but thus it is 

sir george saville threw out in the house  that he wished to carry
home to his constituents the news of an accommodation with america 
and mr david hartley has given notice of his intentions to make a
motion relative to us  but i confess i have no expectations  mr
hartley s motions and speeches have never made any great fortune in
the house  nor been much attended to  from whence i conclude  if the
present great leaders  even of opposition in the house  were seriously
disposed to do anything towards a pacification  which we could attend
to  they would not suffer mr hartley to have the honor of making the
motion 

the heads of many people run upon a truce with america  and mr
hartley s motion may tend this way  but a truce with america cannot be
made without a peace with france and spain  and would america accept
of such a truce  give great britain time to encroach and fortify upon
all our frontiers  to send enemies into the states  and sow the seeds
of discord  to rise out of her present exhausted condition  suffer
france and spain to relax  wait for alterations by the death of
princes  or the changes in the characters of princes  or ministers in
europe  i ask these questions  that congress may give me instructions 
if necessary  at present i do not believe my powers are sufficient to
agree to a truce  if it was proposed  nor do i believe it would be for
our interests or safety to agree to it  if i had  i do not mean 
however  to give any decided opinion upon such a great question  in
this hasty letter  i am open to conviction  and shall obey the
instructions of congress  with the most perfect respect 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

mr burke s bill not being as yet public  we are not yet informed of
the items of it  but as it already appears  that it strikes at the
department of secretary of state for america  and at the board of
trade  there seems to be little reason to doubt that it goes further 
and strikes at the american board of commissioners  at all the
american judges of admiralty  governors of provinces  secretaries  and
custom house officers of all denominations  at least  if this should
not be found to be a part of the bill  there are stronger reasons  if
possible  for abolishing this whole system of iniquity  together with
all the pensions granted to the refugees from america  than even for
taking away the board of trade  and from several late paragraphs in
the papers  and from mr fox s severe observations in the house of
commons upon governor hutchinson  calling him in substance the
 firebrand that lighted up all the fire between the two countries   it
seems pretty clear  that it is in contemplation to take away all these
salaries and pensions 

if such a measure should take place  exiled as these persons are from
the country  which gave them birth  but which they have most
ungratefully endeavored to enslave  they will become melancholy
monuments of divine vengeance against such unnatural and impious
behavior  nevertheless  as these persons are numerous  and have some
friends in england as well as in america  where they had once much
property  there is a probability  i think  that whenever or wherever
negotiations for peace may be commenced  they and their estates now
almost universally confiscated  will not be forgotten  but much pains
and art will be employed to stipulate for them in the treaty  both a
restoration of their property  and a right to return as citizens of
the states to which they formerly belonged  it is very possible 
however  that before the treaty shall be made  or even negotiations
commenced  these gentlemen will become so unpopular and odious  that
the people of england would be pleased with their sufferings and
punishment  but it is most probable  that the court will not abandon
them very easily 

i should  therefore  be very happy to have the explicit instructions
of congress upon this head  whether i am to agree  in any case
whatsoever  to an article which shall admit of their return  or the
restoration of their forfeited estates  there are sentiments of
humanity and forgiveness which plead on one side  there are reasons of
state and political motives  among which the danger of admitting such
mischievous persons as citizens  is not the least considerable  which
argue on the other 

i shall obey the instructions of congress with the utmost pleasure  or
if  for any reasons they choose to leave it at discretion  if i ever
should have the opportunity  i shall determine it without listening to
any passions of my own of compassion or resentment  according to my
best judgment of the public good  there is another point of very great
importance  which i am persuaded will be aimed at by the english
ministers  i am sure it will by the people of england  whenever times
of peace shall be talked of  for facilitating the return of commerce 
they will wish to have it stipulated by the treaty  that the subjects
of great britain shall have the rights of citizens in america  and the
citizens of the united states the rights of subjects in the british
dominions  some of the consequences of such an agreement to them and
to us are obvious and very important  but they are so numerous  that
it is difficult to determine whether so great a question should be
left to my determination  if  however  contrary to my inclinations  it
should fall to my lot to decide it without instructions  it shall be
decided according to my conscience  and the best lights i have 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

it has been observed in former letters  that there is scarcely an
example of such a series of fortunate incidents as that which happened
to rodney s fleet  and it may be proper to dilate a little upon some
of these incidents  to show that the enthusiastic applause  which is
given him by the court  the lords  the commons  and the city of
london  is no otherwise merited than by the boldness of his
enterprise  unless simple good fortune is merit 

it must be allowed  that it was a desperate plan in the minister to
order him out on the design to succor gibraltar  and it was a
desperate resolution in him to undertake it  because he had to expect
to meet with the whole spanish squadron at cadiz  and that it would
follow him  which was in fact the case 

don gaston sailed from brest the 13th of january in search of admiral
rodney  with twenty spanish ships of the line  with four french ships
of the line  the glorieux  the burgundy  the zodiac  and the scipio 
with the frigate  the nereis  under the chef d escadre  the chevalier
de bausset  if the four and twenty ships of the line had joined don
langara s squadron  there is scarce a possibility of doubt  after the
brave defence made by him  with such inferior force  that rodney s
fleet would have been totally ruined  and consequently gibraltar
reduced to extremities  but this was not to happen  the next day after
don gaston sailed from brest  he met with a terrible storm  which
separated his fleet  two of his spanish ships arrived at cadiz the
31st of january  the serious and the atlant  each of seventy guns  the
third of february there arrived twelve others  the rayo  commanded by
don gaston  and the st louis  both of eighty guns  the velasco  the st
francis de paule  the s  isabella  the s  joachim  the st peter  the
st damase  the arrogant  and the warrior  all of seventy  the mink of
fiftysix  and the frigates  the assumption and the emerald  with the
french division under the chevalier de bousset  excepting the scipio 
commanded by the baron de durfort  which did not arrive until the 17th
of february  after having cruised ten or twelve days off st vincent 
which had been appointed as the place of rendezvous and reunion  in
case of separation  the guardian angel  of seventy guns  which was
also separated from the squadron  did not arrive till several days
after don gaston at cadiz  having suffered very much  as well as all
the other vessels  in their masts and rigging  by the bad weather  and
especially by the violent gale of wind  which they met with on the 1st
of february  near the cape of st vincent  of the five remaining
spanish vessels  four went into ferrol  the st vincent ferries  of
eighty guns  commanded by don d acre  lieutenant general  the st
charles  of eighty  the vengeur  of seventy  and the septentrion  of
sixty  the fifth  named the st joseph  of seventy  by don orsorno 
chef d escadre  returned to brest dismasted  this separation and
dispersion of the fleet and of its principal officers exposed langara 
and made rodney s fortune  and the necessity these vessels were in of
reparation  gave liberty to the english fleet to put to sea from
gibraltar and regain the atlantic ocean  on the 13th of february  to
the number of twentytwo ships of the line  including those of rodney 
digby  and ross  and four of the vessels taken from the spaniards  and
three frigates  with twelve merchant ships under their convoy  leaving
at gibraltar  the edgar  of seventyfour  the panther  of sixty  which
has been there a long time  and the guipuscoa  of sixtyfour guns 
taken from the spaniards on the 8th of january  with twentyfour
merchant vessels under her convoy 

there has been much conversation for several days  concerning a
spanish armament preparing at cadiz  and letters from carthagena say 
that the regiment of infantry  called the flankers  regiment  which
has been in garrison in that city  has been completed by orders from
the court of naples  and on the 1st of march  the first battalion
marched for cadiz  and on the 4th of march  the second battalion  it
is said that this regiment is to embark with several others  which
from different garrisons have arrived at the same place for america 
in all parts of which  according to appearances  the english will have
enough to do to maintain their ground this ensuing campaign 

in ireland  on the 22d of february  an assembly of the gentlemen 
clergy  and freeholders of the city of dublin  resolved unanimously 
that the advantages obtained in commerce are neither complete nor
solidly established  that the sense of the nation is  that the irish
parliament alone  in concert with the sovereign  can give to the laws
already obtained of the prince their obligatory force  that what has
been done ought not to be considered as anything more than a great
beginning  and that the general hope was  that the end of the session
would be as advantageous to the political constitution of the country 
as the commencement of it had been favorable to commerce  that the
fathers of the country are particularly requested and instructed to
obtain a declaratory act  which may preserve forever the free and
independent state of ireland  and by introducing some necessary
modifications of poyning s law  to prevent in future all controversy
between the king and the parliament of ireland  concerning fundamental
laws 

these instructions were given by the sheriffs to the representatives
of dublin  who answered that they were convinced  that no foreign
legislative power whatsoever had any right  or ought to arrogate to
itself any authority over their nation  and without injuring the legal
and known authority  which his majesty has a right to exercise over
this kingdom in a manner conformable to the laws  they would neglect
nothing to obtain an act  which should take away every unjust
restriction  and which should tend to assure the constitutional
independence of the kingdom  this is said to be the general sense of
the whole kingdom  so that it may truly be said  that the british
empire is crumbling to pieces like a rope of sand  insomuch  that if
the war should continue  i shall not be at all surprised if even
scotland should become discontented with the union  and the disputes
between the ministry and the east india company should terminate in
the independence of asia  nay  it would be no miracle if the west
india islands should request the protection of france and spain  or
the united states  i will take the first opportunity to write upon the
subject of lord north s loan  which  together with the other ways and
means  amounts to the amazing sum of £20 674 000 sterling 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

on the 2d day of march the news of the royal consent to the bill 
which the british parliament has passed for granting to ireland a free
commerce with the american colonies  the west indies  and the coast of
africa  was celebrated in dublin by public rejoicings  the guns of
the lark were discharged  the garrison made a _feu de joie_  the
castle and other public buildings were illuminated  as well as some
private houses  the government were probably encouraged to these
demonstrations of joy  by the motion  which was made the day before 
that is  the 1st of march  by mr dennis doly in the house of commons 
for an address of thanks to the king  to which both parties
unanimously consented  not excepting the principal patriots  such as
mr ogle  mr hussy burgh  and mr grattan 

the address contains an assurance of their attachment to the royal
person and government of the king  a profession of gratitude for his
majesty s uninterrupted attention to the interest of ireland  and for
the happy alteration  which the wisdom of his councils  and the
liberal sentiments of the british parliament have effected in the
situation of their affairs  they express a double satisfaction for the
benefits  which have been granted them  because they appear to them to
be an efficacious remedy for the poverty of that country  and because
they furnish an unquestionable proof of that fraternal affection 
which they think they have a right to expect from great britain  and
which they will constantly endeavor to cultivate and augment to the
most perfect degree of mutual confidence  they profess the sincerest
pleasure in finding that the ties  which have ever united the two
kingdoms  have been bound faster than ever  by the conduct of their
fellow subjects  and they assure his majesty  that on their part  they
will never fail to make the greatest efforts for the maintenance of
that close connexion between the two kingdoms  which they firmly
believe to be inseparable from their happiness and prosperity 

the next day the house of peers  even at the motion of the duke of
leinster  followed the example of the house of commons  their address
is in substance the same  with this addition  that the benefits
received afford a remedy proportioned to their distress  and that they
will discountenance with all their power all attempts  that deluded
men might make to excite ill founded apprehensions in the people  and
to turn their attention to the commerce  which has been granted them
in a manner so extensive 

to these additions  however  there was an opposition  and finally a
protest  signed by lord carrisford  the earls of charlemont and arran 
and the viscounts powerscourt and mountmorris  and by the proxies of
the earl moira  and the lords eyre and irnham 

the duke of leinster  however  has brought upon his reputation by this
motion suspicions all over europe  that he has been gained by the
king  which a little time and his future conduct will either dissipate
or confirm 

the next day parliament adjourned to the 11th of april  congress will
be able to put a just interpretation upon these addresses  by the
account i gave in my last  of the instructions of the city of dublin
to their representatives  and their answer  as well as by those of the
county of dublin  which remain to be communicated  on the 7th of
march  there was held at kilmainham  an assembly of the freeholders of
the county of dublin  when the following instructions to their
representatives were agreed on 

 we  your constituents  desiring to acknowledge as we ought  the
advantages our commerce will derive from the particular attention 
which his majesty has given it  from the integrity of our parliament 
the firmness of our countrymen  and the justice  which the english
nation begins to render us  we declare to you  that what follows is
the principal cause of our joy upon this occasion  it appears to us 
that the desire of monopolising commerce was the only motive  which
could make england imagine that she had a right to usurp a legitimate
authority over this kingdom  and from the moment when she renounced
this monopoly  she has taken away the principal obstacle  which
opposed our liberty  and consequently the british nation will not
continue to itself an arbitrary power  from which she can derive
nothing but reducing this kingdom to slavery  we desire to know 
moreover  whether the united efforts of the parliament and people of
ireland ought to confine themselves  so as to leave this island in a
state of dependence and submission to laws  to which the nation has
never consented  to laws dictated by a parliament  in which she has no
representatives  let it not be said  that this power attributed to the
english parliament is chimerical  we may see the proofs of it even in
the repeal of several of the acts and in this  that several persons
declare  however falsely  that this power is founded upon law  having
an equal right to political liberty and to commerce  but deprived of
both  and nevertheless content to be restored to the enjoyment of a
free commerce alone  will it not appear  that we absolutely give up
the former  this idea would be absurd  it is then our duty to declare
to the universe  that we are of right a free nation  not to be
subjected to any laws  but such as are made by the king and parliament
of ireland 

 desirous of nothing so much as to live always in good intelligence
with the british nation  on account of the union of the two crowns 
our instructions are  that you shall make the greatest efforts to
obtain an act  which shall establish forever the independence of the
legislative power of ireland  we wish  moreover  that you would
endeavor to qualify poyning s law  by taking away from the privy
council the legislative power  in accomplishing these important
objects  you will acquire honor to yourselves  and give satisfaction
to the nation 

 it is not to be doubted  that you will also fall upon some plan of
economy  by making savings  which are become necessary to increase the
revenue of the crown  and improve the commerce of the nation  

it seems now very plain  that the irish nation aspires to an
independence of great britain the most unlimited  and acknowledges no
other connexion with her but that of affection and a subjection to the
same king  the troops already raised by associations amount to between
sixty and seventy thousand men  which are to be forthwith augmented by
ten thousand more  who are to be formed of countrymen  each officer is
to furnish four  who will be clothed and paid out of the funds  that
each regiment will establish for this purpose  the principal objects
of these armed associations are said to be  a free and unlimited
commerce to all parts of the world  except only the east indies  the
repeal of poyning s law  passed under henry the seventh  and another
under george the first  which restrains the legislative authority of
the irish parliament  with an express clause  that the parliament of
ireland ought  and shall be forever and wholly exempt from all kind of
control and dependence of the british parliament  in all cases
whatsoever  that students shall no longer be obliged to go to the
temple in london  and other seminaries in england to study law  but 
in future  they shall study in the university of dublin  under proper
professors  and shall be admitted to the bar in ireland by the lord
chancellor and the other judges  after a proper examination  the
judges to be natives  except the chancellor  the bishops also to be
natives 

in the meantime  the slightest circumstances may blow up the flames of
war between the two kingdoms  which would have been done some weeks
ago  if the regular officers of the king s troops had not given way to
the dublin volunteers

  sir 

i think it my duty to lay before congress what may occur in holland 
relative to the present war  at least until the arrival of mr laurens 
whose presence is much desired there  many appearances make it
probable  that the grasping and vindictive temper of the english will
compel the republic into the war  if they do take a part  it is very
certain it will be against england  as plunder and revenge are the
present ruling passions of the english  it is probable  that a war
with holland is rather wished for than otherwise  because the ministry
and their principal supporters seem to have no idea  that it is
possible to make things worse  and all the plunder they can get will
be so much clear gain  the dutch are so much alarmed and aroused  that
it is very certain the prince finds it necessary to give out  that he
has been deceived by the english  that he has changed his sentiments 
and that he will promote with all his influence unlimited convoys  it
is certain  that they are fitting their men of war with a great deal
of activity  and it is confidently affirmed  that they have made a
treaty with russia and sweden  who are to make a common cause  the
states of the province of friesland have come to a resolution  that it
was certain byland was not the aggressor  but that fielding had not
hesitated to make use of force to visit the dutch ships under convoy 
to stop those that were loaded with hemp  and to insult the flag of
the republic  that this proceeding shows  that the complaisance
hitherto shown to england  in depriving the ships loaded with masts
and ship timber of the protection of the state  in leaving them to
sail alone and without convoy  has had no effects  and consequently
the states judge  that a similar condescension ought no longer to take
place  but  on the contrary  all merchandise whatsoever  which the
treaties do not expressly declare to be contraband  ought  without the
least difficulty  to be admitted under convoy  and enjoy the
protection of the state  and to this effect  his most serene highness
ought to be requested to give orders to the commanders of the men of
war  and of the squadron of the republic  to protect  as heretofore 
all merchandise 

this resolution was taken the 29th day of february  and laid before
the states general  who  after debating upon it  determined to require
the deputies of the other provinces to obtain  as soon as possible 
the decision of their provinces upon the same subject  these two
provinces  holland and friesland  have already decided for unlimited
convoys 

sir joseph yorke  on the 21st of march instant  laid before their high
mightinesses another memorial  insisting on the aid which he had
demanded before  upon condition  in case of refusal  that his master
would  after three months consider all treaties between the two
countries as null  and in which he contends  that the protection
afforded to captain jones  whom he calls a pirate  in the texel and in
amsterdam  was a violation of the treaties 

in order more clearly to comprehend the dispute between great britain
and the states general  it may not be amiss to observe  that by the
marine treaty between the two powers  concluded at the hague in 1667 
all the subjects and inhabitants of the united provinces may  with all
safety and freedom  sail and traffic in all the kingdoms  countries 
and estates  which are  or shall be in peace  amity  or neutrality
with the states general  without any hinderance or molestation from
the ships of war  gallies  frigates  barques  or other vessels
belonging to the king of great britain  or any of his subjects  upon
occasion or account of any war  which may hereafter happen between the
king of great britain and the above said kingdoms  countries  and
estates  or any of them  which are  or shall be  in peace  amity  or
neutrality with the states general  and this freedom of navigation and
commerce shall extend to all sorts of merchandise  excepting
contraband goods  that this term of contraband goods  is to be
understood to comprehend all sorts of fire arms  their appurtenances 
and all other utensils of war called in french   _servans à l usage de
la guerre_   and that under this head of contraband goods  these
following shall not be comprehended  corn  wheat  or other grain 
pulse  oils  wine  salt  or generally anything that belongs to the
nourishment or sustenance of life  but they shall remain free  as
likewise all other merchandise and commodities not comprehended in the
foregoing article  and the transportation of them shall be permitted
even into places at enmity with great britain  except such places are
besieged  blocked up  or invested  masts  yards  ship timber  and
hemp  the articles now in dispute  are not contraband by this treaty 
or by the law of nations  yet great britain  in the hours of her
insolence and madness  which are not yet at an end  makes no scruple
to seize  condemn  and confiscate them  she pretends  that as the
dutch refuse to her the aid she demands by treaty  she has a right to
seize upon masts  timber  and hemp  which are not prohibited by
treaty  not to enter into the inquiry  whether the present case is
such  as by the treaties obliges the dutch to furnish her aid  but
admitting for argument s sake it is so  yet the consequences will not
follow  it would only follow  that great britain was absolved from the
obligation of the treaty  not by any means that she is discharged from
the obligations of the law of nations

i have received the letter  which you did me the honor to write on the
21st instant  i remember very well to have said to you  that your
presentation should be inserted in the gazette of france  but  from
the information i have since obtained  it seems that the
presentations  whether of ambassadors or ministers plenipotentiary 
are not thus announced in our gazette  and it would have the
appearance of affectation to insert yours  as a substitute  i will
have it mentioned  if you wish  in the _mercure de france_  and you
can take measures to have the notice repeated in the foreign gazettes 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have the honor of your excellency s letter of this day  in answer to
mine of the 21st of this month  until the receipt of it  i had taken
it for granted  that the presentation of every ambassador was
regularly inserted in the gazette of france  and until very lately 
several days since the date of my letter to your excellency of the
21st of this month  i had supposed  that the presentation of ministers
plenipotentiary was constantly inserted likewise 

the information your excellency has given me  that the presentation of
neither ambassadors nor ministers plenipotentiary have ever been
inserted  has perfectly satisfied me  and i doubt not will equally
satisfy my countrymen  who have heretofore been under the same
mistake with myself 

i approve very much of your excellency s proposition of inserting my
presentation in the mercury of france  and shall take measures to have
it repeated in the foreign gazettes 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have the honor to enclose to congress copies of certain letters 
which i have had the honor to write to the count de vergennes  and of
others  which i have received from him 

it seems that the presentations of the american commissioners and
ministers plenipotentiary have not been inserted in the gazette  which
occasioned some uneasiness in the minds of some of our countrymen  as
they thought it a neglect of us  and a distinction between our
sovereign and others  the enclosed letters will explain this matter 
and show  that no distinction has been made between the
representatives of the united states and those of other powers 

i ought to confess to congress  that the delicacy of the count de
vergennes about communicating my powers is not perfectly consonant to
my manner of thinking  and if i had followed my own judgment i should
have pursued a bolder plan by communicating  immediately after my
arrival  to lord george germain  my full powers to treat both of peace
and commerce  but i hope congress will approve of my communicating
first to this court my destination and asking their advice  and then
pursuing it  because i think no doubt can be made  that it is my duty
to conduct my negotiations at present in concert with our ally  as i
have hitherto done 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

there is an anecdote  which causes a great speculation at present 
because it is supposed to show the tendency of things in ireland  and
what is to be expected by great britain  if the ministry should oppose
themselves to the wishes of the irish nation  on the 23d of february 
three bodies of volunteers  those of dublin  commanded by colonel john
allen  those of the liberties  commanded by sir edward newingham  and
another body  commanded by mr taylor  assembled at the exchange  from
whence they made a long march in a circuit of four miles  accompanied
with other volunteers on horseback  to the park  the avenues of which
were guarded by five other corps of volunteers 

there they went through the manoeuvres and firings  with as much
celerity and precision as any regular troops  they were there reviewed
by the duke of leinster  as general and commander in chief 
accompanied with four aids de camps  and they all rendered to this
nobleman military honors almost equal to those which are rendered to a
king 

returning from the review  the volunteers met in barrack street a
detachment of the royal troops marching to the castle  these required 
that the volunteers should turn out of the way  and endeavored to
break their ranks  but the volunteers  with their bayonets fixed and
charged  stood their ground and discovered such a resolution  that the
commanding officer of the king s troops ordered them to halt  and
desired to speak with the duke of leinster  they entered into a
conference  the regular troops pretended they had a right to the
pavements  as the troops of the king  the volunteers  thought they had
a right to keep it  as free citizens  voluntarily armed for the
defence of their country  and consequently superior to mere
mercenaries  they supported these arguments by preparations for
battle  the people declared themselves in favor of the volunteers  by
collecting together a sufficient quantity of stones  to overwhelm the
troops  who at last gave way  in order to avoid a scene of blood  the
next day the volunteers sent to the viceroy an excuse  but couched in
terms  which justified their conduct as necessary to maintain the
liberty  independence  and dignity of the nation  i have seen so much
of the spirit of the king s troops  in several contests between them
and the citizens of boston  as to know very well what all this means 
the volunteers must have great confidence in their own strength  and
the king s troops equal diffidence of theirs  before an altercation of

  dear sir 

i have received yours of the 26th  and that of the 15th of this month 
i enclose a copy of the letter you desire 

m  garnier is gone into the country  and i have not seen him since i
arrived here  mr izard  however  has seen him  and will give you a
satisfactory account of what he says 

if i were to apply to the other gentleman  you know what would be the
consequence  it would fly very soon to  you know where  and i should
have only the credit of meddling unnecessarily with disputes  which i
have kept out of as much i could  and which it is certainly now the
public interest  and consequently my duty  to keep out of as much i
can  i had  therefore  rather be excused  the gentleman himself would
probably give you the same answer to a letter from you directly to
him  as he would give to me  unless i should use arts with him  which
would be unworthy of you  as well as of me  and which i cannot use
with anybody 

i shall have enough to do  to steer my little bark among the rocks and
shoals  i shall have perplexities enough of my own  which i cannot
avoid  and dangers too  these i shall meet with a steady mind  and
perhaps none of them will be greater than that  which i think my duty 
of avoiding things that do not belong to me 

scarcely ever any minister executed a commission for making a peace 
without ruining his own reputation  in a free government  no minister
that ever existed  had a more difficult and dangerous peace to make
than i have 

the gentleman you mention has hitherto been very still  but he has
been well received  by all that i have learnt 

  adieu

                    to the president of congress 

                                                paris  april 3d  1780 

  sir 

the prince of orange  stadtholder  is not only supposed to have
ambitious views of allying his family to that of great britain  but is
very much influenced by the duke of brunswick  who is a field marshal 
and commander in chief of the dutch land forces  who is also a brother
of prince ferdinand  the duke is not upon the best terms with his
family  because they think he is too much attached to the house of
austria  by this double attraction of england on one side  and their
old friends the house of austria on the other  it is not very
surprising that his most serene highness is drawn a little aside from
the line of the american cause  which is now so closely connected  and
likely to be more so  with the house of bourbon  hence it is said 
that the count de byland is to be honorably acquitted by the court
martial  and hence the embarrassments the dutch are under  in their
wishes to resent like men the unparalleled injuries  that have been
done them by the english  there is  however  so much spirit in the
united provinces  as to oblige the prince to put on the appearance of
resentment at the insults offered to his flag  and to oblige the
british minister to assume the tone of menace  in order to work upon
the fears of the people  whose property is so exposed as to make them
dread a war with any nation whatever 

congress will  however  be able to judge of what is doing in holland
by the following proceedings  a petition was presented to their high
mightinesses on the 25th of february  for the equipment of fiftytwo
ships of war  in the following terms 

 your high mightinesses having thought proper by your resolution of
the 17th of this month  which came to us the 22d  to require us to
present to your high mightinesses  without influencing  however  in
anything the deliberations of the confederates  a petition for the sum
of two million six hundred and twenty thousand five hundred and
ninetyeight florins  to assist towards the one half of the necessary
expense for an extraordinary equipment of fiftytwo vessels of war and
frigates  which are to be put in a condition of service by the first
of may  as well as of other articles more fully particularised in the
report contained in the resolution of your high mightinesses  and in
the estimate enclosed with it  which we flatter ourselves were made
with all possible accuracy  while the funds necessary for the half of
the equipment abovementioned  will be found in the produce of certain
duties 

 we have been the more zealous not to delay giving satisfaction to the
requisition of your high mightinesses  as we consider the said plan 
as tending to accomplish what has been for so many years represented
and advised  as well by his serene highness as by us  in general
petitions addressed successively to your high mightinesses  as well as
to the confederates  that is to say  to put the republic in a more
respectable state of defence  by augmenting her marine and troops  an
object upon which it has been again insisted in the petition of the
current year  which employed such reasons and such urgent motives to
this purpose  that expressions now fail us for adding anything to what
has been already said  and persuaded  moreover  as we are  that the
circumstances and facts  such of them as have passed in a manner so
remarkable  render useless and superfluous all further reasonings  in
such sort  that all these details being already perfectly understood 
as well by your high mightinesses as by the confederates  we think we
may depend upon this knowledge  in expectation of the definitive
resolutions of your high mightinesses  equally salutary and unanimous 
and the effect of which will be to prevent and ward off the new
misfortunes  which may threaten the republic  assured  moreover  and
persuaded  that the serious intention of the confederates is to
accomplish the equipment proposed with all that depends upon it  and
that to this end  their high mightinesses will be pleased  not only to
give their consent to the petition of two millions six hundred and
twenty thousand five hundred and ninetyeight florins  formed by the
present  but also  what is more important  to furnish as soon as
possible their quota to the general treasury  by which means the
colleges of the admiralty  whose duty it is to attend to the
equipments  may be possessed of the means necessary to this operation
at convenient periods  which will be thought more indispensably
necessary  on casting an eye on the reasons more amply alleged in the
report of the colleges of the admiralty  and expressed in the
resolution of your high mightinesses  the 17th of february  to which
we refer  


                               memorial 

on the twentyfirst of march  1780  sir joseph yorke  the british
ambassador  presented a memorial to their high mightinesses  of the
following tenor 

      high and mighty lords 

      the king  my master  has always cultivated the friendship of
     your high mightinesses  and has always considered the alliance 
     which has so long subsisted between the two nations  as founded
     upon the wisest principles  and as essential to their mutual
     prosperity  the principal objects of this alliance  which stands
     upon the immovable basis of a common interest  are the safety and
     prosperity of the two states  the maintenance of the public
     tranquillity  and the preservation of that just balance so often
     disturbed by the ambitious policy of the house of bourbon  when
     the court of versailles  in direct violation of the public faith 
     and of the common rights of sovereigns  had broken the peace  by
     a league made with the rebel subjects of his majesty  avowed and
     declared formally by the marquis de noailles  when  by immense
     preparations  france manifested her designs of annihilating the
     maritime power of england  the king expected that your high
     mightinesses  too enlightened not to see  that the safety of the
     republic is closely connected with that of great britain  would
     have been zealous to come to his assistance  one of the first
     cares of his majesty was  to inform your high mightinesses of all
     the circumstances of this unjust war  and in the critical
     situation in which the king found himself he did not forget the
     interests of his ancient allies  but  on the contrary  has shown
     the most sincere desire to favor the commerce and the free
     navigation of the republic  as much as the safety of his people
     could permit  he even desisted a long time from demanding the
     succors stipulated by the treaties  fulfilling thus his own
     engagements  without insisting on the accomplishment of those of
     your high mightinesses  the demand was never made  until after
     the united forces of france and spain showed themselves ready to
     fall upon england  and there attempt a descent by the assistance
     of a formidable fleet  although frustrated in this enterprise 
     the enemies of the king meditate still the same project  and it
     is by the express order of his majesty  that the undersigned
     renews  at this time  in a manner the most formal  the demand of
     the succors stipulated by different treaties  and particularly by
     that of the year 1716 

      hitherto your high mightinesses have been silent upon an article
     so essential  at the same time  you have insisted on a forced
     construction of the treaty of commerce of the year 1674  against
     the abuse of which great britain has protested at all times  this
     interpretation cannot be reconciled to the clear and precise
     stipulations of the secret article of the treaty of peace of the
     same year  an article of a treaty of commerce cannot annul an
     article so essential of a treaty of peace  and both are expressly
     comprehended in the principal treaty of alliance of 1678  by
     which your high mightinesses are obliged to furnish to his
     majesty the succors  which he now demands  you are too just and
     too wise not to feel  that all the engagements between powers
     ought to be mutually and reciprocally observed  and although
     contracted in different periods  they oblige equally the
     contracting parties  this incontestible principle applies itself
     here with so much the more force  as the treaty of 1716 renews
     all the anterior engagements between the crown of england and
     the republic  and incorporates them  as it were  together 

      moreover  the subscriber had orders to declare to your high
     mightinesses  that he was ready to enter into conferences with
     you  to regulate in an amicable manner all which might be
     necessary to avoid misunderstandings  and prevent every
     disagreeable occurrence  by concerting measures equitable and
     advantageous for the respective subjects 

      this friendly offer was refused  in a manner as unexpected as it
     was extraordinary and unusual among friendly powers  and without
     taking notice of repeated representations  both public and
     secret  upon the subject of convoys  your high mightinesses have
     not only granted convoys for different kinds of naval stores  but
     you have moreover expressly resolved  that a certain number of
     vessels of war should be held ready to convoy in the sequel naval
     stores of every species  destined for the ports of france  and
     this at a time when the subjects of the republic enjoyed by the
     force of treaties  a freedom and an extent of commerce and of
     navigation far beyond that  which the law of nations allows to
     neutral powers  this resolution  and the orders given to admiral
     byland  to oppose himself by force to the visits of merchant
     ships  have given place to the incident  which the friendship of
     the king would have greatly desired to have prevented  but it is
     notorious  that this admiral  in consequence of his instructions 
     first fired upon the sloops bearing the english flag  which were
     sent to make the visit in the manner prescribed by the treaty of
     1674  it was then a manifest aggression  a direct violation of
     the same treaty  which your high mightinesses seem to look upon
     as the most sacred of all  his majesty has made beforehand
     repeated representations of the necessity and justice of this
     visit  practised in all similar circumstances  and fully
     authorised by this treaty  they were informed in london  that
     there were in the texel a great number of vessels loaded with
     naval stores  and particularly with masts and large ship timber 
     ready to set sail for france immediately after  or under  a dutch
     convoy  the event has but too fully proved the truth of these
     informations  since some of these vessels have been found even
     under this convoy  the greatest number have escaped  and have
     carried to france the most efficacious succors  of which she
     stood in the greatest necessity 

      at the same time your high mightinesses thus aided the enemy of
     the king  by favoring the transportation of these succors  you
     imposed a heavy penalty upon the subjects of the republic  to
     restrain them from carrying victuals to gibraltar  although this
     place was comprehended in the general warranty of all the british
     possessions in europe  and although at that time spain had vexed
     the commerce of the republic  in a manner the most outrageous and
     unexampled 

      it is not only on these occasions  that the conduct of your high
     mightinesses towards the king  and towards the enemy of his
     majesty  forms a most striking contrast in the eyes of all the
     impartial world  no one is ignorant of that  which passed in the
     too well known affair of paul jones  the asylum granted to this
     pirate was directly contrary to the treaty of breda  of 1667  and
     even to the proclamation of your high mightinesses of 1776 
     further  although your high mightinesses have kept  and still
     keep a silence the most absolute  with regard to the just demands
     of his majesty  you have been forward  at the simple request of
     the king s enemies  to assure them of an absolute and
     unconditional neutrality  without any exception of the ancient
     engagements of the republic  founded upon the most solemn
     treaties  nevertheless the king would still persuade himself 
     that all which has passed ought to be attributed less to the
     disposition of your high mightinesses  than to artifices of his
     enemies  who  after having excited discord among the members of
     the state  seek alternately by menaces and by promises to animate
     them against their natural ally  his majesty cannot believe  that
     your high mightinesses have taken the resolution to abandon a
     system  which the republic has pursued for more than a century 
     with so much success and so much glory 

      but if such was the resolution of your high mightinesses  if you
     were determined to forsake the alliance with great britain  in
     refusing to fulfil the engagements of it  there would arise from
     this resolution a new order of things  the king would perceive
     such an alteration with a sensible regret  but the consequences 
     which would follow from it  would be necessary and unavoidable 
     if by an act of your high mightinesses  the republic should cease
     to be the ally of great britain  the relations between the two
     nations will be totally changed  and they will no longer have any
     other ties or relation than those  which subsist between nations
     neutral and friendly  every treaty being reciprocal  if your high
     mightinesses will not fulfil your engagements  the consequence
     will be  that those of his majesty will cease to be obligatory 
     it is in pursuance of these incontestible principles  that his
     majesty has ordered the subscriber to declare to your high
     mightinesses  in a manner the most friendly  but at the same time
     the most serious  that  if contrary to his just expectations 
     your high mightinesses do not give him  within the term of three
     weeks  to be computed from the day of presentation of this
     memorial  a satisfactory answer  touching the succors demanded
     eight months ago  his majesty  considering this conduct as a
     departure from the alliance on the part of your high
     mightinesses  will no longer consider the united provinces in any
     other light than that of other neutral powers not privileged by
     treaties  and consequently will  without further delay  suspend
     conditionally  and until further orders  in regard to their
     subjects  all the particular stipulations of the treaties between
     the two nations  particularly those of the treaty of 1674  and
     will hold himself simply bound by the general principles of the
     law of nations  which ought to serve as rules between powers
     neutral and not privileged 

                                                        joseph yorke  

on the 24th of march  the states general made the following answer to
sir joseph yorke 

      that their high mightinesses had resolved to represent to his
     britannic majesty by the count de welderen  their envoy
     extraordinary  that having seen by the memorial of the
     ambassador  dated the 21st of march  that his majesty fixed a
     term of three weeks to have a satisfactory answer touching the
     succors demanded  their high mightinesses wished to satisfy  as
     soon as possible  the desires of his britannic majesty  by giving
     him a positive answer  but they foresaw  that the form of
     government inherent in the constitution of the republic would not
     permit them to complete their answer in the time specified  as
     the memorial of the ambassador  having become an object of the
     deliberations of the representative provinces  it was necessary
     to wait the resolution of the several states  the assemblies of
     which were now sitting  or about to sit  that their high
     mightinesses assured themselves  that his majesty  considering
     these reasons  would not persist rigorously in the time fixed  to
     the end  that their high mightinesses might have that of forming
     in a manner conformable to the constitution of the republic  in
     which their high mightinesses had not a right to make any
     alteration  an answer to the memorial of the ambassador  their
     high mightinesses promising to neglect nothing for accelerating 
     as much as possible  the deliberations upon the subject  and they
     pray the ambassador to support these representations  with his
     good offices  with the king  his master  

sir joseph yorke  after reading this answer  replied  that whatever
might be his desire to satisfy the inclinations of their high
mightinesses  the orders of the king  his master  would not permit him
upon this occasion  that  however  he doubted not  that they would be
equally satisfied by the representations with which their high
mightinesses had charged the count de welderen at the court of london 

  i have the honor to be  with great respect   c

                    to the president of congress 

                                                paris  april 3d  1780 

  sir 

the fermentation in england has already distressed the administration
and overawed some of the members of the house of commons  but there is
room to suspect  that this is chiefly to be attributed to the approach
of an election  the petitions are very far from being universal  and
the congress of the sub committees is not yet numerous 

at a meeting of these from york  surry  middlesex  sussex  gloucester 
hertford  kent  huntington  dorset  bucks  chester  devon  and essex 
from the cities of london  westminster  gloucester  and the towns of
newcastle and nottingham  holden at the st albans tavern  and
afterwards by adjournment at the great room in king street  st james 
on the 11th  14th  15th  17th  18th  and 20th days of march  1780  the
reverend christopher wyvill in the chair  a memorial was agreed on 
containing reasons for a plan of association 

they affirm that there is a despotic system  and they date the
commencement of it nearly from the beginning of the present reign  and
they say that they have arrived at the crisis  which the wisest of the
political writers marked for the downfall of british liberty  when the
legislative body shall become as corrupt as the executive  they should
have said more corrupt  because that is undoubtedly the fact at
present  as well as the case stated by montesquieu 

they say  that by the unhappy war with america  begotten in the first
instance of this despotic system  and nursed with a view of giving
completion to it  the fatal influence of the crown has been armed with
more ample means for enslaving parliament  while the nation has
visibly sunk almost into beggary  never did any country experience so
sudden a reverse from prosperity to depression  they state the fall of
rents  the accumulation of taxes  and the stagnation of all credit 
they then run a long course of reasoning  to show the utility 
importance  and necessity  of the several things they recommended to
the people of england  which are all comprehended in a few
propositions 

1st  they recommend perseverance in the petitions  and an association
in support of them 

2dly  a new law for taking the suffrages of the people at elections 
to prevent expense and influence 

3dly  to adopt  as part of their general associations  the following
propositions 

i  that an examination be made into all the branches of the receipt 
expenditure  and mode of keeping and passing accounts of public money 

ii  one hundred  at least  of additional members of counties in the
house of commons 

iii  that the members of the house of commons be _annually elected_ 

iv  that it is recommended to all voters to support  at the next
election  such candidates as shall  by signing the association or
otherwise  satisfy them that they will support these regulations in
parliament 

in the middlesex committee  at the masons  tavern  march 24th  this
circular letter and the memorial it contained were unanimously
approved  and their members in the general congress thanked  in the
westminster committee  king s arms tavern  palace yard  march 15th 
1780  it was resolved   that by the resolution of the general meeting 
directing this committee to prepare a plan of association on legal and
constitutional grounds  to support the laudable reform  and such other
measures as may conduce to restore the freedom of parliament  this
committee conceive themselves bound to enter into the consideration of
every question tending to establish the independency of parliament on
a solid and durable basis  that the duration of parliament  and the
state of the representatives of the people  are questions immediately
under this description  that a sub committee  consisting of seven
persons  be appointed to inquire into the state of the representation
of the nation and make a report   on the 20th of march  the
sub committee reported  the report is dated the 19th   that new
parliaments to be holden once in every year were the ancient usage 
and declared to be the hereditary and indefeasible right of the people
of england  that the 6th of william and mary is the first  which
attempts to appoint the time of the continuance of parliament to be
for the term of three years  though the same act recognises the
ancient laws and statutes of this kingdom  by which annual parliaments
were confirmed  and declares that frequent and new parliaments tend
very much to the happy union and good agreement of the king and
people  that by the 1st of george the first  the parliament then
chosen for three years   by acquiescence of the people to the act of
william and mary  on the faith of its declaring  that from henceforth 
no parliament whatsoever  that shall at any time hereafter be called 
assembled  or held  shall have any continuance for longer than three
years only at the furthest   did pass an act to prolong its
continuance to seven years  that temporary considerations are stated
in the preamble to the act  as the principal motives for the act
itself  that the 6th of william and mary is worded as if declaratory
of what was conceived  however falsely  to have been the constitution
of the country  but that the septennial act assumes a power of
altering the duration of parliament at pleasure  that these
alterations in the constitution of parliament were made without
communication with the constituent body of the people  and have been
continued without the sanction of their approbation  that the
septennial bill was strongly opposed in parliament  and a direct
infringement on the constitution  and a flagrant breach of trust
towards the constituent body  that it was supported almost entirely on
the principle of expediency  that the voice of the people appeared
strongly against it  in many respectable petitions to parliament on
the occasion  and that a constitutional protest was entered by the
peers  stating  that frequent parliaments were the fundamental
constitution of the kingdom  that the house of commons ought to be
chosen by the people  and when continued for a longer time than they
were chosen for  they were then chosen by the parliament and not by
the people  that they conceived the bill  so far from preventing
corruption  would rather increase it  for the longer a parliament was
to last  the more valuable to corrupt ones would be the purchase  and
that all the reasons which had been given for long parliaments might
be given for making them perpetual  which would be an absolute
subversion of the third estate  that various motions were afterwards
made and strongly supported for a repeal of the septennial act 
particularly a motion for annual parliaments in 1774  which was lost
only by a majority of thirtytwo  that the city of london and other
respectable bodies continued to instruct their representatives to
prosecute this object in the most vigorous manner  as essentially
necessary to the independency and integrity of parliament  the rights
of the people  and the prosperity of their country  that by the 8th of
henry sixth  the parliament  then elected by the commonality at large 
passed an act to disfranchise the greater part of their constituents 
by limiting the right of election of knights of the shire to persons
having free lands  or tenants  to the value of forty shillings by the
year  at the least  which restriction has ever since continued  that
many towns and boroughs  formerly entitled for their repute and
reputation  to send members to parliament  have since fallen into
decay  yet continue to have a representation equal to the most opulent
counties and cities  while other towns and places  which have risen
into consideration  and become populous and wealthy  have no
representatives in parliament  that the number of the inhabitants of
england and wales is above five millions  that of these  twelve
hundred thousand are supposed capable of voting  as the constitution
stood before the restrictive act above quoted  that not more than two
hundred and fourteen thousand are at present permitted to vote  that
out of these  one hundred and thirty thousand freeholders elect
ninetytwo members for fiftytwo counties  fortythree thousand citizens 
freemen and others  elect fiftytwo members for twentythree cities and
two universities  and fortyone thousand electors choose three hundred
and sixtynine members for one hundred and ninetytwo towns and
boroughs  that fifty of these members are returned by three hundred
and forty electors  and a number scarcely above six thousand  being a
majority of the voters of one hundred and twentynine of the boroughs 
return two hundred and fiftyseven representatives  which is a majority
of the whole english house of commons  and the efficient
representation of above five millions of people  that many of these
boroughs are immediately under the influence of the crown  as the
cinque ports  many of them are private property  affording hereditary
seats  as those under burgage  tenure  and some of them almost without
houses or inhabitants  as galton  newtown  and old sarum  that
considering the representation with reference to property  many
counties return representatives out of all proportion to what they
contribute to the public revenue  that cornwall pays to land tax and
subsidy  sixteen parts out of five hundred and thirty  and sends
fortyfour members to parliament  while middlesex pays not less in
proportion than two hundred and fiftysix  and sends eight members  so
that the inequality of the representation of this country  with regard
to property  is still greater than when estimated according to the
numbers of its inhabitants   the westminster committee after
considering this report  mr fox in the chair  came to the following
resolutions 

 1  that annual parliaments are the undoubted right of the people of
england  and that the act which prolonged their duration was
subversive of the constitution  and a violation on the part of the
representatives  of the sacred trust reposed in them by their
constituents 

 2  that the present state of the representation of this country is
inadequate to the object  and a departure from the first principles of
the constitution 

 3  that thanks be given to the sub committee for their very
intelligent report 

 4  that copies of it be sent to the several committees of the
counties  cities  and boroughs of the kingdom  

i have been thus particular in stating the proceedings of these
committees  because it must be an advantage for congress to have them
all in view  and to see the whole of the foundation that is laid  they
are some of the most important proceedings of the present reign  they
are the commencement of a new sovereignty in opposition to the old  if
there is virtue or good sense in the nation  these machines will
discover it and set it in motion  and provided the war continues  it
will prevail  but if there is neither virtue or sense remaining  or
not enough of these to produce the desired effect  it will probably
be the last national effort made in favor of liberty  and despotism
will range at large 

if the king would make peace now  he would dissipate all these
combinations in england  ireland  and holland  as well as prevent the
treaty with spain   which i believe is in a good way  from a letter
which i lately saw from mr carmichael   from giving advantages  to
spain  and disadvantages to england  which can never be altered  but
if he continues the war long  if he should have signal successes 
these may dispel the storms in england and ireland  but if he should
be unsuccessful  the new sovereignty will probably prevail against
him  after involving the three kingdoms in confusion and blood

  sir 

there is an anecdote from malaga  which ought to be mentioned to
congress  because  it cannot fail to have serious consequences 

the swedish frigate  the illerim  of thirtyfour guns  commanded by
captain ankerloo  on the 28th of february  at half after eight o clock
at night met an english privateer belonging to minorca  of twentyeight
guns  the swedish captain  after hailing the privateer  let her
continue her course  and went on quietly his own  about half an hour
after the privateer returning  ranged herself astern of the frigate 
and unexpectedly discharged both his broadsides  loaded with langrage 
which killed three sailors  broke the thigh and the right leg of the
captain  wounded the lieutenant and some people of the crew  ankerloo 
who in the evening had been obliged by a violent gale of wind to draw
in his guns and shut up his ports  not finding himself prepared for
battle  his officers took immediate measures  with the utmost
alertness  for repulsing the privateer  which did in fact at last
receive one broadside from the frigate  but  upon the whole  she
escaped in the night  by the force of sails and of oars  after this
perfidy on the part of the english  ankerloo would have entered
marseilles for the sake of dressing his wounds  but having met with
contrary winds and bad weather for three days  he put into malaga 
where he went ashore to the house of the swedish consul  where he is
since dead of his wounds 

  i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect   c

                                               paris  april 6th  1780 

  sir 

it may be necessary to transmit the decree of sir james mariott 
against the dutch ship la sybellina hillegonda  in order fully to
comprehend the proceedings  which i have sent before  the decree is
this 

 the fact in this case is  a dutch ship loaded with naval stores  for
a port in france  under the convoy of not less than five men of war 
and the commander of these men of war  not measuring his conduct by
the line of the treaty  resists  fires upon the boat of the english
commodore  and forbids the execution of the treaty  the english
commodore returns the fire  the dutch admiral fires again  and
strikes  so that the fact is to be adjusted  and it is of such a
nature as has never before happened in the history of this nation  it
falls unfortunately to my share  to decide upon these facts and their
consequences 

 it is  nevertheless  a consolation  that although the judge of this
court may decide  in the first instance  there is still a superior
tribunal  in the last resort  this court ought to judge of the case of
the treaty  since  in virtue of a special commission  under the great
seal of the kingdom  the judges of the courts of admiralty are
authorised and required to take cognizance of  and proceed judicially
in all manner of captures  seizures  prizes  and reprisals  and decide
upon them according to the course of the admiralty and the law of
nations 

 the claimant disdains to found his right in any other way than upon
the treaty  my idea is  that all the marine treaties  which subsist
between two friendly powers  form but one code of laws  one great
confederation  one indivisible union  they are  if it is lawful to
make use of these sacred words  the bible  the book  or the testament
of the social contract between the nations  to be maintained
inviolably  as a system  whereof we cannot break one part without
dissolving the whole 

 the dutch subjects have  in virtue of the treaty  particular
privileges  superior to those of every other country  but they may
overleap the bounds of these privileges  and from that time they ought
to be weighed in the balance  like other neutral nations  to be found
under a convoy is not  in itself  an infraction of the treaty  but the
conduct of this convoy is to be considered 

 the fifth article of the treaty of 1674 is reciprocal   if any ship 
belonging to the subjects of his majesty of great britain  shall in
open sea  or elsewhere  out of the dominions of the said states  meet
any ships of war of the lords the states  or privateers belonging to
their subjects  the said ships of the lords the states  or of their
subjects  shall keep at a convenient distance  and only send out their
boat  with two or three men only  to go on board such ships or vessels
of the subjects of his majesty  in order that the passport  or
sea brief  concerning the property thereof  according to the form
hereunder annexed  may be produced to them  by the captain or master
of such ship or vessel  belonging to the subjects of his majesty  and
the said ships  so producing the same  shall freely pass  and it shall
not be lawful to molest  search  detain  or force such ship from her
intended voyage  and the subjects of the lords the states shall enjoy
in all things  the same liberty and immunity  they in like manner
showing their passport  or sea brief  made out according to the form
prescribed at the foot of this treaty  

 the sixth article is   if any ship or vessel  belonging to the
english or other subjects of great britain  shall be met making into
any port belonging to an enemy of the lords the states  or  on the
other side  if any ship belonging to the united provinces of the
netherlands  or other subjects of the lords the states  shall be met
in her way  making into any port under the obedience of the enemies of
his said majesty  such ships shall show  not only a passport  or
sea brief  according to the form hereunder subscribed  wherewith she
is to be furnished  but also her certificate or cocket  containing the
particulars of the goods on board  in the usual form  by the officers
of the customs of that port  from whence she came  whereby it may be
known whether she is laden with any of the goods prohibited by the
third article of this treaty  

 such are the terms of this treaty  which this court will not declare
to be now in force  but one of the parties may renounce it  and it
would be from that time  so far forth  a good cause of annulling it 
it could not ever have been the intention of the contracting parties 
that the merchant ships of the subjects of the states should become
the transport vessels for the service of the king of france  nor that
the men of war of the states should serve as a convoy to them  it is
impossible to form an idea more unworthy of the sovereignty of the
states  the idea of granting a convoy to all dutch ships destined for
the port of an enemy is offensive  and still more aggravating  when
accompanied with resistance  or orders to resist  when they go so far
as to reject _ipso facto_ all the ordinary ways of public justice  and
to set at nought the articles  which had been established to prevent
the consequences of the intervention of neuters  as parties in a war 
by public acts  articles which stipulate a legal procedure for
discussing all the points in controversy  before the courts of
admiralty reciprocally  and in case the parties should not be
satisfied  they ought to be finally heard by their respective
sovereigns in council  such is the tenor of the twelfth article of the
treaty of 1674 

 in the present state of the cause  this court will not say 
nevertheless  that the states have annulled the treaty  because the
orders of admiral byland have not appeared  and his conduct may be
disavowed by the states  but even the granting of a convoy  and above
all of a squadron  is essentially offensive  since the dutch subjects
are already sufficiently armed by the treaty  and by the methods of
redress prescribed  which are the same with all maritime nations  the
party complaining follows the ship and the papers  which she has on
board  into the jurisdiction of the place and country where he is
carried  as the subject  who in the nature of things and proceedings 
can only of necessity be judged there  where the original proofs
exist  the judges specially constituted  for the decision of prizes 
both in the first instance and in the last resort  are  by common
consent  charged to hear and determine all national differences
between powers who are friends and allies  like the council of
amphyctions in ancient greece  but seamen do not well comprehend this
language  they speak roughly  like the mouths of their cannons  if
this vessel had fired upon the boat  and any one had thereby lost his
life  i think i should not have hesitated to condemn her upon general
principles  neither admiral byland  nor his instructions  are before
me  i know not how to give a sentence against him or his vessels 
nevertheless  he ought not to have fired upon the boat of commodore
fielding  but he was bound to send to him his boat  and to propose an
interview and an amicable conference  he might have made him a visit 
which he immediately would have returned  and all the captains of the
dutch merchant ships might have been ordered on board the english
commodore  to produce their passports and cockets  the effect of his
resistance is thus the cause  that  although i do not declare the
treaty null generally  nevertheless  in retaliation to these vessels
taken in time of resistance  i ought to declare the ship forfeited of
its privilege  and foreclosed of the treaty  by the act of m  byland 
there was certainly never any vessel under convoy without
instructions  at least in her course  and without signals  if the
claimants had not withheld them  it would have appeared  whether the
dutch admiral ought  or ought not to have escorted these ships even
into the ports of france  which would have aggravated the offence
against the treaty  a convoy of a single ship  destined for the
states  destined for the colonies of the states  or loaded generally
with innocent commodities  is  in itself  inoffensive  because  in
these times  there are in all the seas little pirates  furnished with
all sorts of commissions  american  french  spanish  and english  but
a squadron of a line of battle ships  and which appears force     even
to the treaty  which they claim the benefit of  is a serious affair 
to engage in hostilities is not the way of protecting commerce  and
those who have solicited the states to grant such a convoy  were
rather factious americans  or intriguing french politicians  than
solid  sensible dutchmen  true and real friends of their country 
there is certainly among them a number of worthy people  who can never
desire to become  in fact  a province  under the obedience of the king
of france  or his resident minister 

 the case of the swedish convoy is not applicable to this case  that
convoy had not made any resistance  the ships entered the downs by the
bad weather  and were there taken without their convoy  which came to
anchor near them  this was represented  and the course of justice was
followed  the ship s papers were produced directly in this court  the
requisites were done  and the causes finally discussed according to
the style of the admiralty  _velo levato_  no time was lost  either in
contesting the justice or demanding right  and the captains of the
ships returned contented with their vessels after they had been paid
the freight  as well as the expense  and the naval stores  which they
had on board  were purchased by the government  by virtue of powers
granted to the council of the royal marine  by act of parliament  in
conformity to acts of parliament in former wars 

 the question  whether the hemp and flax are contraband  is clear 
both of them have been adjudged such on all former occasions  when the
quantity has been considerable  and particularly  when they are not of
the produce of the country of the party which carries them  the flax
is as necessary for sails  as the hemp for cordage  and if this court
has once ordered that flax should be sold to the commissioners of the
navy  it was because it was of little value  and in very small
quantity  i am sorry to learn  that the navy board makes any
difficulty upon this subject  the iron on board was only for ballast  

i cannot go through with the whole of this decree for want of time 
but the following curious and convenient doctrine ought not to be
omitted 

 that  which in the natural or intellectual world is called quality 
is not relative  good and evil are relative  everything is what it is 
and acquires its denomination from comparison  degree  manner 
quality  place  time  person  fault   c   c  these relations
constitute the metaphysical essence of every complex idea in the human
understanding  hence that source  without end  of disputes  the glory
of the bar  and of the schools of philosophy 

 grotius and bynkershoeck agree  and who is there that will deny  that
necessity gives a right to make ourselves masters of everything 
without the seizure of which a nation cannot defend herself  as in
relation to want  if the enemy  on one part  is in want of stores  the
want to intercept them on the other is equal  and in relation to
blockades  every port of the enemy is blocked relative to a neutral
vessel loaded with stores  which is seized  and  by consequence 
blocked  or hindered to go there  it imports little  that whether the
blockade be made across the narrows at dover  or off the harbor at
brest  or l orient  if you are taken  you are blocked  great britain 
by her insular situation  blocks naturally all the ports of spain and
france  she has a right to avail herself of this situation  as a gift
of providence 

 in fine  it is necessary to observe  that the claimants  founding
themselves upon the privilege of the treaty  have not a single paper
on board to prove the property of the cargo  in which respect all are
defective  the sentence then  is  that  under the circumstances of
this case  the claim of privilege is rejected  and that the dutch
master be enjoined to produce his sailing orders  and certificates and
cockets from the custom house of the port from whence the ship sailed 
according to the stipulations of the sixth article of the treaty of
1674  the hemp and flax are condemned as contraband on board of this
ship  and the owners of the iron are held to prove their property  

i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect  sir  your most
obedient and most humble servant

                                               paris  april 7th  1780 

  sir 

there are several articles of intelligence today  which are connected
with the subject of my letter of yesterday  one is from the hague  the
2d of april   thursday night last two couriers from petersburgh
arrived here  alighted at the hotel of the prince gallitzen  the envoy
extraordinary of her majesty the empress of all the russias to the
states general  one of the couriers set off immediately for london  to
the russian minister who resides there  the prince gallitzen having
been in conference the next day with the president of the assembly of
their high mightinesses  relative to the said despatches  this
minister sent back  the next night after his arrival  the same
courier  from that time the report runs  that the object of these
despatches was to communicate to the republic the measures taken by
russia  with some of the northern powers  for ensuring respectively
the safety of the navigation and commerce of their subjects  and to
invite the states general to enter into the same arrangements  

the other is from constantinople  the 14th of february   the
privateers continue to vex the neutral ships in the seas of the grand
seignior  by visiting and stopping them wherever they find them  and
even without any discretion  at the entry of the ports and under the
guns of our fortresses  the french frigate  the gracieuse  which lay
at anchor in the road of cyprus  having learned that an english
privateer had brought into the port of this island a french prize 
sent to her some boats armed to retake her  which they could not
accomplish  however  without having some men killed on both sides  the
english consul having carried his complaints to the government of the
island  of a violation of the laws of nations and demanded assistance 
he was so well succored  that the french were obliged to abandon the
prize  and all of their nation who were in the island came very near
being massacred by the turks  as the porte has also been informed 
that on the other hand the ship smyrna  of rotterdam  has run a risk
of undergoing the same fate with the ship of captain kinder  of
amsterdam  and perhaps to suffer treatment still harder  and in sight
of the city of smyrna  she has not only resolved to send new orders to
all the commandants  to enjoin them very seriously to observe a
neutrality the most exact  by fulfilling their duty  but she has also
testified her sensibility in regard to all these depredations to the
ambassadors of the courts of france and england  by sending to them
last saturday a representation in writing  purporting  that as the
porte had not failed to observe  during the war between france and
england  an exact and perfect neutrality to facilitate their commerce
upon an equal footing  and to afford to their ships all possible
safety in her seas  it was natural that she should  and ought to
expect  that the two powers would answer her conduct with a sincere
friendship  that at the news of the first differences arisen between
the two kingdoms  there were conferences held with their ambassadors 
in which it was agreed upon an equal footing  that the rules of the
sea should not be violated  and that they should be  on the contrary 
exactly observed and respected  that in consequence of this agreement 
the porte had not neglected anything to fulfil of fortresses and
castles in the empire  to protect the ships of war and merchant men
against every attack  and not to suffer that any hostilities should be
commenced in the ports of the grand seignior  and under the cannon and
in sight of his fortresses 

 but in spite of all these measures  these powers had not taken care
to observe them  which was the cause that no nation could now navigate
freely and safely  that even to this time  the porte had not received
the least answer on the subject of a regulation of neutrality  which
had been formed upon the footing of that which had been established
during former wars between christian powers  and of which
communication had been made to the said ambassadors  with a view to
put a stop to the intolerable irregularities which had taken place in
his seas  and to the end to prevent in consequence continual
complaints and representations  that the porte was informed foreign
privateers held his ports blocked up  and forced the ships which
entered into them or went out  without even excepting the turkish
vessels  to submit to their unjust visits and searches 

 that such a conduct  being contrary to the honor of the empire  the
porte ought to determine  as soon as possible  and communicate to the
belligerent powers a good regulation  to the end  to procure by that
means repose  to his subjects  whom providence had confided to his
care  and to this end it was necessary  that the ambassadors of these
two powers should be advertised to request their courts  in the first
place  to send  as soon as possible  to the captains and officers of
ships armed for war  or privateers  precise orders  and as some time
must pass before they can receive such orders  the porte hopes that
the gentlemen  the ambassadors  will be so good in the meantime  as to
order the captains and officers to suspend their operations  and
abstain from all acts of hostility 

 and as  in consequence of the ancient regulations  every time that
any vessels of war or armed ships come into the seas of the grand
seignior  the foreign ministers were held to give notice to the porte
of the object of their expedition or voyage  of their destination  and
of the time they were to stay  it could not but be regarded as
unreasonable  and entirely contrary to the reciprocal friendship  if
these formalities should not be observed  the porte  considering it as
one of its principal duties  to employ all possible means to procure
the tranquillity of its merchants  to protect their possessions
against all force and injustice  as also to grant its protection to
the subjects of the belligerent powers  and those of other powers who
are equally good friends of this empire  

the porte finishes  by giving notice to the ambassadors  that the
capitan pacha was ordered to oppose himself in a friendly manner to
the enterprises of those  who should pursue the ancient proceedings 
and to protect the merchants and the ships of all nations  who carry
on commerce in the countries of this empire  whose sovereigns live in
friendship with the porte 

a third is a letter from petersburg  7th of march   the rencounter
which the dutch convoy  on going out of the texel the later end of
december  under the command of admiral byland  had with the english
squadron under commodore fielding  as well as the violent and hostile
manner in which they made prize of this convoy  have occasioned here
the greatest astonishment  and it is very much desired to know the
consequences of this measure  which is generally considered as very
offensive to the republic of the united provinces  and derogatory both
to the treaties subsisting between the two nations  to the law of
nations  and to the respect which ought to take place between two free
and independent powers  

but that which is thought more extraordinary still  is  that the court
of london should have ordered a step so violent and insulting at a
time when  having to maintain a war so dangerous as that against
france  spain  and the united states of america  her situation must
appear not less anxious than dangerous  which this court itself seems
to acknowledge  by representing as she has done  that not finding
herself in a condition to oppose the dangerous designs of the house of
bourbon  which  if you believe her  threaten the safety of all europe 
she believed herself consequently to have cause to demand succors
here  as well as from the republic of the united provinces  however
this may be  it is nevertheless notorious  that the solicitations of
england have produced no effect here  which has given no small
satisfaction to those  who consider in their proper point of light the
designs and the conduct of this power  since the commencement of this
war against the liberty of commerce and the navigation of free and
independent powers  by means of which people in general seem so much
the more pleased with the present resolution taken by her majesty the
empress of all the russias  relative to the said solicitation  as well
as with the system of neutrality  which she has adopted  because
without this wise measure there is no doubt but great britain would
have pushed much further the irregularity of her proceedings 

the english  who are here  exert themselves as much as they can to
justify and even to praise this proceeding of their nation towards the
said convoy  but in vain have they attempted to induce the public to
adopt this error  by advancing boldly  that the court of russia
approves the violence  which they have exercised in this rencounter 
no man believes them  since in fact it is impossible that the empress
can approve an action so diametrically opposite to the tenor of
treaties  to the law of nations  as well as to the dignity of a
sovereign and independent power  the injustice of which is so
notorious  that if it had been committed with similar circumstances
upon the russian flag  the princess herself would have been the first
to have condemned it  thus the reports  which the english propagate
here  of the approbation given to these proceedings  imply so much the
more of a manifest contradiction to the sentiments and manner of
thinking of the empress and her ministers  that it is well known  that
from the beginning of the present troubles  the court of russia has
made representations and complaints against that of london  for the
violent and arbitrary manner of acting  which this last has indulged
herself in  against the navigation and commerce of neutral powers 
from whence it has resulted  that other nations  in imitation of this
proceeding  have embarrassed business more and more  until there
exists no safety for any  which causes the greatest embarrassment to
merchants and the freighters of ships 

i ought to add to this letter  that the english emissaries  who
propagate false news everywhere and about everything  having
circulated a report  that the porte was discontented with the peace
made with russia  the grand seignior thought it necessary to order the
interpreter of the court to declare to all foreign ministers  that the
sultan and all his ministers had every reason to be very well
satisfied with the accommodation with the empress of russia  and that
he was determined to maintain religiously all the articles contained
in that treaty  all these things tend to show  that the state of
europe continues the same  and that england  instead of getting an
ally  is likely to have a combination of all maritime powers to bring
her to reason 

  i have the honor to be   c

  sir 

i have this moment the honor of your letter from madrid of the 29th of
february  as i suppose  although the month is not mentioned  i thank
you  sir  for commencing a correspondence  which i have for some time
wished to begin  i wrote to mr jay at madrid  on the 22d of february 
and wish to know if he has received the letter  it is certainly
proper  that those who are intrusted abroad should maintain a
correspondence and cultivate a good understanding with each other 
because  although their departments are in some respects separate  yet
in others they are intimately connected  from all that i heard in
spain  i expected  that you would meet with an agreeable reception at
madrid  and i am much pleased to learn from you  that i was not
mistaken 

i have sometimes wondered at the slowness of spain in making a treaty
with us  but  when i reflected upon a certain secret article  my
surprise ceased  we are already bound in a treaty to her  but she is
not bound to us  it would be ungenerous in her  however  to hold us
long in this situation  the treaty  notwithstanding all that has been
justly said of the advantages to us  is not less advantageous to our
allies  the single article  that binds us to exclude all armed vessels
of the enemies  in all future wars  from our ports  is worth more
millions to them than this war will cost  nay  it will be a severer
loss to great britain  than all that she has spent in it  whether
great britain has considered this or not i do not know  but she will
some time or other discover it  and feel the inconvenience of it 

you ask for news from america  a vessel from baltimore is arrived at
bordeaux  but not a single letter to dr franklin or me  she brings two
or three baltimore newspapers  one as late as the 15th of february 
there has been a hard winter  deep snows  uncommon frosts  frozen over
from connecticut to long island  and from new jersey to staten island 
lord sterling went over to staten island with a party on the ice 
burnt a few vessels and a guard house  took a few prisoners  and
brought off a few deserters  some new jersey people went over at the
same time  and plundered without mercy  finding the communication open
with new york  which had been supposed to be obstructed by the ice  he
returned  an article from a fishkill paper says  that clinton and
cornwallis sailed the 26th of december  with seven thousand men  for
the west indies  but that the storm  which happened soon after their
departure  was supposed to have done him mischief  a ship  brig  and
schooner were lost in the storm on cape cod  unknown who or whence 
all perished  congress had recommended to all the states to regulate
prices at twenty for one  which  by the speculations in the papers 
was not well liked  governor johnson is a delegate for maryland 
general ward for massachusetts  in the room of mr dana   who desires
me to return you his compliments and respects   the other delegates as
last year  this is all the news i can recollect  having seen the
papers only a few minutes in a large company 

the general state of affairs appears very well  i see no probability
of england s obtaining an ally  on the contrary  there are many
symptoms of an approaching combination of the maritime powers  to
protect neutral ships from searches and insults  ireland is in the
full career of independence  england seems determined to force holland
into a war against her  that she may have an opportunity to plunder
her 

the correspondences and associations in england distress the ministry
very much  and  if the war continues and they should not be very
successful  it seems likely  that they would save us the trouble of
despatching them  i wish  however  that france and spain were more
convinced of the advantages they have in america and the west indies 
the more ships they send into those seas  the more they will force
england to send there  and the more she sends there  the weaker she is
in europe  and the less she is dreaded and respected  holland 
ireland  the opposition in england  and the other maritime powers all
feel a confidence rising in proportion to the diminution of the
british naval force in europe  besides the innumerable advantages the
french and spaniards have  in supporting the war in the american seas
over the english  which they have not in europe  but i am apprehensive
of being tedious  my compliments to mr jay and his family

                    to the president of congress

  sir 

there are several miscellaneous articles of intelligence  which ought
to be mentioned to congress 

one from copenhagen  of the 25th of march   the count de lucchese 
minister of the king of the two sicilies  and charged at the same time
with the affairs of the court of madrid  has received orders to
declare to ours  that the king of spain had it in contemplation to
make arrangements relative to merchant ships of neutral powers  and
with which we should have cause to be very well pleased  however this
may be  we have not any news that the danish ships detained  to the
number of twenty  at cadiz and malaga  have been as yet released 
which is a great damage to those who are interested in those vessels 

 there is arrived in this city a courier coming from st petersburg 
who has also passed through stockholm  who after having delivered his
despatches to the envoy extraordinary of her majesty  the empress of
all the russias  at this court  immediately continued his journey for
hamburg  

another is from madrid  the 13th of march   it is said that our court
will soon publish a new regulation relative to the dutch navigation 
in the meantime  they have released two ships of this nation  viz  the
griffin and the zandam  which were detained at algeziras 

 the register ships destined for the havana and vera cruz  which are
ready at cadiz  are to sail immediately  these ships will be convoyed
by twelve ships of the line and two frigates  as far as the canary
islands  it is assured  that there will be embarked on board of this
fleet  twelve thousand men  who are to be transported to america under
the command of don victa de nava  lieutenant general  the last letters
from the havana import  that there were in that port fourteen ships of
the line  as well as four thousand men ready to embark for an
expedition  the object of which is yet unknown  two of our cruisers
have entered barcelona with five very rich prizes  among which  one
had on board eighteen thousand guineas  destined for mahon  

another from paris   letters from malta of the 11th of february
inform  that the king s frigate  the syracuse  commanded by m  clavel 
off candia  has taken the english cutter  the buck  of twentyfour
guns  twelve swivels  and two hundred and three men  commanded by
captain george flagg  and that the bad condition to which the
engagement had reduced her  had induced him to sink her  

another from francfort  of the 1st of april   they write from hesse 
that they continued to raise many recruits  and that there were at
ziagenham six hundred and eight volunteers  who were to set off in a
little time with eleven hundred and twenty men for america  

another from amsterdam  of the 6th of march   we learn from dort  that
they expected there the english vessels destined to transport the
german troops for the service of england  which were still at
nimeguen  and they write from the hague  that general faucet had
arrived there a few days since  

another from london  of the 31st of march   the despatches  which the
court has last received from sir joseph yorke  excite the particular
attention of the ministry  although the contents of them have not yet
been made public  it is said  nevertheless  that in consequence of the
memorial  presented on the 21st to the states general by the british
minister  their high mightinesses have taken the _pre avis_  relative
to the succors demanded by great britain  which  although conceived in
very moderate terms  contains  nevertheless  a refusal to furnish the
succors demanded  the republic  as it is pretended  founding its
inability to comply with this demand principally upon the
non existence of the case of invasion of the british states  as a
case  which alone could lay them under obligation to accede to the
requisition of the king of england  the count de welderen  envoy
extraordinary of the states general  has been on the 29th in
conference with lord stormont  and communicated to him the _pre avis_
of their high mightinesses  relative to the requisition of his
britannic majesty  upon the subject of which the states general will
soon take a formal resolution  it is reported also  that his
excellency has likewise imparted to our ministry the sentence of a
court martial  which has adjudged  that count byland was not the
aggressor in the affair of the seizure of the dutch ships by
commodore fielding  however  it is asserted  that the court of st
james has declared afresh   that if the states general refuse to
furnish to england the succors demanded in virtue of the treaties  she
will give orders to search  without distinction  all dutch ships under
convoy and without convoy  and that all the merchandises and effects
destined for the french and spaniards  which shall be found loaded on
board of these vessels  shall be seized and confiscated  adding  that
it is neither just nor reasonable  that the republic should be
excused  on her part  from the observation of the treaties  while
england should be held on hers to fulfil the conditions  and that
thus  in consequence of her former declaration  the republic should be
no more considered but on the footing of other neutral powers  

 they say  moreover  that the reasons alleged by their high
mightinesses in justification of their refusal to acquiesce in the
demand of england  are of a nature to convince our ministry  that such
an acquiescence would produce consequences equally hurtful to the
respective interests of the two powers in the present conjuncture 

 we are assured  that each man of the crews of the squadron of
commodore fielding  will receive more than nine pounds sterling  for
his share of the proceeds of the captures made of the dutch convoy 
and that there will be two hundred pounds sterling paid to the king s
ships at spithead  for their part of the prizes which they have made 

 the court has received  within a few days  a great number of
despatches from its ministers at foreign courts  the contents of which
have given occasion to several cabinet councils  those of sir joseph
yorke have excited a particular attention 

 the officers of all the vessels of war destined for sea  have
received orders to repair on board as soon as possible  and be ready
to sail on the first notice  the officers of the regiments of regular
troops  and of the militia  must also join their respective corps
without delay  that they may be ready to march by the middle of april 
the forces will encamp nearly in the same place as last year  and
there will be some detached corps ready to join the different camps
according to circumstances  

i have the honor to be  with the greatest respect and esteem   c

  sir 

the _memoire_ of the prince gallitzen  envoy extraordinary from the
empress of all the russias to the states general  presented the third
of this month  is of too much importance to the united states of
america  and their allies  to be omitted to be sent to congress  it is
of the following tenor 

    high and mighty lords 

      the undersigned  envoy extraordinary of her majesty  the empress
     of all the russias  has the honor to communicate a copy of the
     declaration  which the empress  his sovereign  has made to the
     powers actually at war  your high mightinesses may regard this
     communication  as a particular mark of the attention of the
     empress to the republic  equally interested in the reasons which
     have given birth to this declaration 

      he has  moreover  orders to declare  in the name of her imperial
     majesty  that how much soever she may desire  on the one hand  to
     maintain during the present war the strictest neutrality  she
     will  nevertheless maintain  by means the most efficacious  the
     honor of the russian flag  and the safety of her commerce  and
     the navigation of her subjects  and will not suffer that any
     injury should be done to it by any of the belligerent powers 
     that to avoid  on this occasion  all misunderstanding or false
     interpretation  she has thought it her duty to specify in her
     declaration the terms of a free commerce  and of that which is
     called contraband  that if the definition is founded upon notions
     the most simple  the most clear  and the most determinate by the
     law of nature  that of the latter is taken by her literally from
     the treaty of commerce of russia with great britain  that by this
     she proves incontestably her good faith  and her impartiality
     towards both parties  that she thinks  consequently  that she
     ought to expect  that the other commercial powers will be earnest
     to accede to her manner of thinking relative to the neutrality 

      in pursuance of these two views  her majesty has charged the
     subscriber to invite your high mightinesses to make a common
     cause with her  insomuch  that this union may serve to protect
     commerce and navigation  observing at the same time the most
     exact neutrality  and to communicate to you the measures which
     she has taken in consequence  similar invitations have been
     already made to the courts of copenhagen  stockholm  and lisbon 
     to the end  that by the common cares of all neutral maritime
     powers  a neutral system  founded on justice  and which  by its
     real utility  may serve as a rule for future ages  may be
     established and made legal in favor of the commercial navigation
     of neutral nations  the subscriber makes no doubt  that your high
     mightinesses will take into consideration the invitation of her
     imperial majesty  and concur in making  without delay  a
     declaration to the belligerent powers  founded upon the same
     principles with those of the empress  his sovereign  by
     explaining your sentiments at the same time upon the subject of
     the protection of your commerce  of your navigation  and of the
     nature of contraband goods  conformably to the terms of your
     particular treaties with other nations  moreover  the subscriber
     has the honor to assure your high mightinesses  that if  for
     establishing solidly a system  equally glorious and advantageous
     to the prosperity of navigation in general  you will commence a
     negotiation with the neutral powers abovementioned  to the end to
     establish a particular convention upon this subject  the empress 
     his sovereign  will be ready to engage in it 

      your high mightinesses will readily perceive the necessity of
     coming to a resolution upon subjects equally important and
     advantageous to humanity in general 

      the subscriber requests the favor  that your high mightinesses
     would furnish him with a speedy answer 

                                                           gallitzen  

                                                   

                             declaration

     _of her majesty  the empress of russia  made to the courts of
         versailles  madrid  and london  mentioned in the foregoing
         memorial _

 the empress of all the russias has manifested so visibly the
sentiments of justice  equity  and moderation  which animate her  and
has given  during the whole course of the war maintained against the
ottoman porte  such convincing proofs of her attention to the rights
of neutrality  and the freedom of commerce in general  that  in this
respect  she may appeal to the testimony of all europe  this conduct 
as well as the scrupulous exactness with which she has observed the
rules of neutrality during the course of this war  has given her room
to hope  that her subjects would peaceably enjoy the fruits of their
industry  and the advantages  which belong to all neutral nations 
experience has  however  taught her the contrary  since neither these
considerations  nor the regard due to what the law of nations in
general prescribes  have been able to hinder the subjects of her
majesty from being oftentimes troubled in their navigation  or
interrupted or retarded in their commerce  by the subjects of the
belligerent powers  these interruptions having come upon business in
general  and that of russia in particular  are of a nature to awaken
the attention of all the neutral nations  and oblige her majesty  the
empress  to seek to deliver herself from them by all means suitable to
her dignity and the well being of her subjects 

 but before she shall put them in execution  being filled with a
sincere desire to prevent all subsequent acts of violence  she has
thought that it was consistent with her equity to lay open to all
europe the principles  which will govern her  and which are
indispensable to prevent all misunderstanding  as well as all which
might give occasion to it  to this she has determined herself with so
much the more confidence  as these principles are drawn from the
primitive law of nations  and adopted by all nations  which the
belligerent powers themselves cannot enervate  at least not without
violating the laws of neutrality  and contemning the fundamental rules
which they themselves have adopted  in divers treaties and alliances
now existing 

 article i  that all neutral vessels ought to navigate freely from one
port to another  as well as upon the coasts of the powers now at war 

 article ii  that the effects belonging to the subjects of the
belligerent powers shall be free in neutral ships  excepting always
contraband goods 

 article iii  that her imperial majesty  in consequence of the limits
above fixed  will adhere strictly to that which is stipulated by the
tenth and eleventh articles of her treaty of commerce with great
britain  concerning the manner in which she ought to conduct towards
all the belligerent powers 

 article iv  that as to what concerns a port blocked up  we ought not
in truth to consider as such any but those  which are found so well
shut up by a fixed and sufficient number of vessels belonging to the
power which attacks it  that one cannot attempt to enter into such
port without evident danger 

 article v  that these principles above laid down ought to serve as a
rule in all proceedings  whenever there is a question concerning the
legality of prizes 

 from these considerations  her imperial majesty makes no difficulty
to declare  that wishing to insure the execution of that  which is
herein before declared  to maintain at the same time the honor of her
flag  as well as the safety of the commerce of her states  and also to
protect the navigation of her subjects against all those whom it may
concern  she has given orders that a considerable portion of her
maritime forces shall be put to sea  with no other intention than to
insure the observation of the most exact and the most strict
neutrality  which her majesty proposes to keep as long as she shall
not see herself absolutely forced to depart from that system of
moderation and of perfect neutrality  which she has adopted  in such
sort  that it will not be but in the last extremity  that her fleet
will exercise her final orders to go wherever the necessity and the
circumstances may require 

 it is then by assuring the belligerent powers in the most solemn
manner  and with all that rectitude and sincerity  which form the
distinguishing character of her imperial majesty  that she declares to
them that she proposes to herself no other thing  than to convince
them of the sentiments of equity with which she is animated  as well
as of the tendency of her salutary views towards the well being of all
nations in general  and particularly of those now at war  and that
consequently her imperial majesty will provide her admiralty as well
as her generals with instructions relative to this system  extracted
from the code of nations  and which they have so often taken for rules
in their treaties  

  i have the honor to be   c

in all  twentyfive counties 

the first meeting of the delegates was march the 11th  1780  the
cities and towns  which have agreed upon similar petitions  are
london  westminster  york  bristol  cambridge  nottingham  newcastle 
reading  and bridgewater 

the counties  which have not yet agreed upon petitions  are
westmoreland  durham  lancaster  salop  stafford  lincoln  leicester 
warwick  oxford  worcester  cornwall  and rutland  hants agreed on a
petition  but appointed no committee  and northampton agreed to
instruct their members on the points of the petition 

this account takes no notice of the twelve welsh counties  these 
however  are small 

the counties  which have already petitioned  it seems  therefore  are
a vast majority of the kingdom in numbers as well as property and
understanding  and the meeting of their committees may be reasonably
considered as a more equitable and adequate representation of the
people of england  than the house of commons 

amidst all the addresses  instructions  petitions  associations  and
resolutions  i never found one that dared to expose the true cause of
their miseries  and to propose a remedy  until the association of the
county of york appeared  which was agreed to by the committee of
sixtyone  to be recommended to the general meeting of the county of
york  held the 28th of march  1780 

they declare their unanimous assent 

1st  to the economical reform requested by the petitions of the
people 

2dly  to the proposition for obtaining a more equal representation of
the people in parliament  by the addition of at least one hundred
knights  to be chosen in a due proportion by the several counties of
great britain 

3dly  to the proposition for the members of the house of commons to be
elected  to serve in parliament for a term not exceeding three years 

but the most important resolution of all was also unanimous   that it
is the opinion of this meeting  that the prosecution of an offensive
war in america is most evidently a measure  which  by employing our
great and enormously expensive military operations against the
inhabitants of that country  prevents this from exerting its united 
vigorous  and firm efforts against the powers of france and spain 
and has no other effect upon america  than to continue  and thereby to
increase the enmity  which has so long and so fatally subsisted
between the arms of both  can be productive of no good whatever  but
by preventing conciliation  threatens the accomplishment of the ruin
of the british empire  

this meeting  which is said to have been the largest ever known  and
perfectly unanimous  gave power to the committee of association to
call the county together when they should judge proper 

after all  even this committee does not appear to see the true
interest of the country  the necessity of peace  peace alone can save
them  they are for leaving america  which is a great thing  but it
does not appear but that they are still for continuing the war with
our allies 

an article of the 4th of april says  that commotions are reported to
have arisen in the county of york  many of the inhabitants of which
have peremptorily refused to pay the taxes 

congress will observe by the paragraphs in the morning post of april
the 1st  that they seem to be in england totally ignorant of the
designs of the empress of russia  and of the other neutral powers 

the paper of april the 3d contains major general campbell s and
lieutenant colonel dickson s account of the surrender of the port of
baton rouge   c  with about five hundred regular troops prisoners of
war  to don bernado de galvez  the 21st of september

  sir 

everything which tends to show the probability of a general
association of the maritime powers  against the violences at sea 
which the english have practised  and which other nations  after their
example  have begun  and which tends to prove the justice  the wisdom 
and the humanity of such an association  is worthy of observation  for
my own part  i think  that the abolition of the whole doctrine of
contraband would be for the peace and happiness of mankind  and i
doubt not  as human reason advances  and men come to be more sensible
of the benefits of peace  and less enthusiastic for the savage glories
of war  all neutral nations will be allowed  by universal consent  to
carry what goods they please in their own ships  provided they are not
bound to places actually invested by an enemy 

_constantinople  march the 3d _  the porte having received the
disagreeable news  that three xebecs from malta had seized upon a
large turkish ship with a rich cargo of coffee  rice  hemp  and other
productions  this advice has accelerated the departure of two
men of war and four gallies  which will go before the fleet of the
grand admiral  to cruise in the archipelago  and protect the
navigation of the european nations against the vexations of the french
and english  

_copenhagen  march the 28th _  captain zagel  the courier of her
majesty  the empress of all the russias  is returned to petersburgh 
accompanied by captain socolousky  secretary of the russian consul in
the sound  they are very busy here in equipping the vessels of war 
the wagrie  of sixtyfour guns  the infodstretten  of sixtyfour  and
the frigate combord  of thirtyfour  

_london  april the 4th _  there are lately arrived here interesting
despatches to government from sir joseph yorke  which contain some
further explanations of the dispositions of the republic  in
consequence of the last memorial presented to their high mightinesses
by that minister  and the resolution to protect the commerce of their
subjects  however this may be  there are actually in the ports of this
kingdom fifty dutch vessels seized by our ships of war  because they
were found loaded with naval stores for our enemies  and  already the
most of their cargoes have been adjudged good prizes  these articles
being considered as contraband  and their transportation to an enemy
contrary to treaties subsisting between the republic and england  

_hague  april the 9th _  we learn  that the states of the province of
overyssell have sent to the assembly of their high mightinesses their
instructions  relative to the two memorials presented by sir joseph
yorke  the 28th of july  and the 26th of november  of the last year 
the first purporting a demand of succors stipulated by the treaty of
1678  and the second demanding an immediate and categorical answer 
the contents of the instructions are   that their noble mightinesses 
after having maturely reflected upon all which concerns the matter in
question  especially upon the treaties existing between the kingdom
and the republics  as well as the obligations  which the two nations
had mutually laid themselves under  and also in particular  upon the
present situation in which this republic now stands in several points
respecting her own preservation  the maintenance of her rights and
possessions  and respecting the powers actually at war  judge  that
the two memorials presented by sir joseph yorke may and ought to be
answered in the following manner  that all the principles alleged  and
the circumstances at this time existing  oblige their high
mightinesses more than ever to watch carefully their own preservation
and defence  to use every effort to ward off all further dangerous
consequences  and to this end  to request his majesty not to take it
in ill part  if in the critical situation of affairs  in which the
least diminution of their forces might be dangerous  their high
mightinesses think themselves lawfully authorised to refuse the
succors demanded by his majesty  although these succors  considering
certain engagements  the pretended application of which it would be
useless at this time to search into  may be judged indispensable by
his majesty  in the firm confidence  that  in the circumstances in
which their high mightinesses find themselves  his majesty  not
disapproving  of their conduct  will desist  not only from demanding
their assistance  but on the contrary  as a proof of the affection of
which his majesty had so often given them assurances  will permit them
invariably to pursue that neutrality  which from the beginning of the
present troubles they have adopted  

 it is asserted  that on the memorial presented by the prince
gallitzen  envoy extraordinary of the empress of russia  their high
mightinesses have provisionally concluded   that having taken the said
memorial into consideration  the deputies of the respective provinces
have sent copies of it  as well as of the papers annexed to it  to be
communicated to their assemblies  praying them to procure  as soon as
possible  the resolutions of the states  their constituents  

 in the meantime  since the said memorial has been made public  it is
given out  that the convention between the courts of petersburgh 
stockholm  and copenhagen  will in a little time be confirmed  and
that denmark will procure  on certain conditions  five or six thousand
seamen for this republic 

 we learn that the answer of his britannic majesty to the
representations which the count de walderen  minister of the
states general at the court of london  has been charged by their high
mightinesses to make to the british government  relative to a
prolongation of the term of three weeks  prescribed in the last
memorial of sir joseph yorke  for giving him a definitive answer   c 
arrived the 31st of last month  and is found to be in the negative 
the king insisting on an answer by the time fixed  which will expire
next tuesday 

 they give out  that the cities of dantzic  lubec  bremen  hamburgh 
 c  will adopt  as well as most of the northern powers  the party of
neutrality  and that  if england persists in the practice of visiting 
stopping  and searching neutral vessels  denmark is resolved to
exclude english vessels from the sound  

to judge of things the most impartially  no man can doubt  that
proceedings so violent  and so contrary to the natural rights of
nations  will make the neutral powers _feel_ how much it imports them
to set bounds to the intolerable excesses  to which their vessels 
sailing under the faith of treaties  are daily exposed by the ships of
one party in the present war 

  i have the honor to be   c

                                              paris  april 15th  1780 

  sir 

there is an article from hamburgh which deserves attention  it is
this 

 the neutrality of the powers of the north is decided  they have
profited of the divisions  which have arisen between england and north
america  by selling to the former  timber  cordage  hemp  and tar 
which she formerly drew from her colonies  the occasions  which the
enemies of great britain have also had for these articles  have
established a competition  which has procured great advantages to the
commerce of the north  they have everywhere taken measures to protect
it  

in vain has england sought assistance from that quarter  her conduct
has irrevocably deprived her of it 

_leghorn  22d of march _  we learn from naples  that the king has
purchased of the order of malta two vessels  to increase the marine of
that kingdom  his majesty is attentively engaged in the care of
forming officers for this department  the young gentry  whom he has
sent to serve on board of the squadrons of the belligerent powers 
have all of them distinguished themselves  and those who remain at
naples  under the direction of the chevalier aston  have discovered
equal zeal  intelligence  and good will  for the service of the
marine  

_madrid  25th of march _  our squadrons  they write from cadiz the
16th of this month  will put to sea without delay  transport ships are
taken up on freight with great activity  and all the troops are
arrived  the following is an exact state of the armament 

 the complete regiments of the king  guadalajara  arragon  soria  and
the second regiment of catalonia  in all ten battalions  making six
thousand and six hundred men 

 the squadron of d  solano  the st louis  of eighty guns  the st
augustine  the orient  the gaillard  the arrogant  all of seventy
guns  and the rule of sixty guns 

 the squadron of d  tomaseo  the st nicholas  of eighty guns  the
eugene  the damase  the st janizer  the st francis  the assisse  and
the warrior  all of seventy guns 

 the first squadron takes in provisions for five months  and the
second for four months and a half  they fill up the regiments  which
are destined for the expedition  with soldiers from the regiment of
hibernia 

 the beautiful wools of segovia have not been always employed within
the kingdom  because the love of labor has not been predominant  but
since the establishment of the royal patriotic society  industry has
recovered its activity  d  laurent ortiz de paz has established
spinneries of wool in that city  and in st ildephonso  and other
places  his majesty has assigned rewards for men and women  who shall
distinguish themselves in this kind of labor  this measure cannot fail
to establish the royal manufacture of fine cloth  which the marquis of
enseñada had already erected at segovia  and which had fallen into
decay with the favor of that minister  

there are in some of the papers hints of a plan of pacification  which
is said to come from the rockingham party  the substance of it is as
follows 

 let us open our eyes  the hope of subjecting america is a chimera 
nothing but clemency can ever open a way for a reconciliation with
its inhabitants  to show that we wish it sincerely let us give up nova
scotia  that dry  uninhabitable  and languishing colony  which
produces nothing  let us also permit the canadians to institute a form
of government  which may be agreeable to themselves  and let the
independence of north america become the object of our support  sooner
or later it will be unavoidable  that america should separate herself
from us  and i should be very glad that a permanent system of alliance
should take place between them and their mother country  before our
ancient colonies shall be united to france  by ties too strict to be
relaxed  i am persuaded  that neither nova scotia nor canada will
remain long under the government of england  and it is to be feared 
that in contending for them we shall still further embroil affairs 
nova scotia is not worth the trouble of keeping it  and it will
require continual succors  canada will occasion us more expense than
it will bring us in profit  and will never become flourishing under an
european government  at least unless the whole country should be
recovered  we deceive ourselves if we imagine  that by emancipating
the americans we shall lose our american islands  we hold these by the
strongest of all ties  which is  that of their own interest  north
america will not seek to make conquests so long as it shall be divided
into distinct states  and under a republican form of government  and
it is probable  that several centuries will pass away before she will
change the form of her administrations  commerce will return into
england  and into our islands  without any other motive than that
which actuates all the commercial nations of the earth  if we were now
disembarrassed of the objects of dispute  concerning which spain
discovers so many pretensions  and if we could content ourselves with
a superiority at sea  all that would result from it would be  that our
trade to the levant would increase  we should become more respectable 
and we should see ourselves more in a condition to maintain our
quarrels  and protect our rich possessions  without hazarding a
bankruptcy by expenses  which we cannot sustain  our maritime power
will always be sufficient to protect our islands  our naval forces
will never want anything so long as we shall have divers markets 
where our vessels may go  the northern powers of europe  and the
northern states of america  will be competitors to serve us  so long
as we preserve the superiority upon the sea  and while  by means of
our manufacturers  we can pay for them  or make an advantageous
exchange  with the one and the other  we have as good a right to
things  which we can purchase in divers foreign markets  as if the
things were the productions of our own establishments 

 are france and spain in want of warlike stores  are they not as well
supplied with them as we are  and do they not make sweden rather
incline to their side  by means of their commerce with that country
for these articles  is it probable that they can ever shut up from us
the ports of america  of russia  of denmark  and of sweden  while it
is the interest of these states to furnish us  it is necessary  then 
to resolve to demand peace by the means which offer themselves  and
which are not only able to obtain it  but may still be preserved  and
in which there is no appearance that we shall be disturbed  if  at
least  at all times we preserve our marine upon a respectable footing 
and  if we do not  we ever subject ourselves to be restrained upon the
article of the number of ships  and in the places where we shall
employ them  in that case we shall not perceive that gibraltar or
minorca is wanting to us  we shall always be ready to meet our enemies
in those parts where our safety  security  and riches lie  and which
nature points out to us as our proper element  surrounded on all sides
by the sea  there is one half of the nation whose inhabitants
understand navigation  from their infancy  and they are disposed to
become seamen because they are almost educated with the sea  but
whenever we shall engage ourselves in the wars of the continent  we
shall never draw from them any solid advantages  where are the
trophies so dearly purchased of king william and marlborough  and
where is the benefit of the two last wars  the balance of power will
not remain long in our hands  although we have engaged the annual
produce of an innumerable quantity of taxes 

 in america we have destroyed the balance  which held our colonies in
dependence  we ought not  then  to lose the opportunity of binding the
interests of the united states with ours by some amicable convention 
which will assure us of their attachment  and deliver us from the
cruel necessity of continuing the war with our own children  it is by
this means we may preserve for a long time our insular property  and
enjoy still a superiority at sea  

_paris  april 11th 1780 _  the ambassador of russia has notified 
within a few days past  to our court  that it was the intention of his
sovereign that the commerce of the subjects of her empire should not
be troubled  and that under no pretence should their vessels be
stopped by those of the belligerent powers  and that she is arming to
defend her flag  and protect it from insults  this declaration was to
be made at the same time to the courts of madrid and london  it is
asserted  that it is the first fruit of a treaty of commerce  which
russia has concluded with us  and of a confederation which she has
entered into with the other northern powers  and in which they wish to
engage holland and portugal  we are very inquisitive to learn how this
notification will be received by the court of st james  

the english ministerial gazettes propagate a report  that there was
arrived in europe a deputy of congress to offer peace to great
britain  those of the opposition assert  that this deputy who is in
fact arrived  will do nothing but in concert with france  when it
shall please england to propose a negotiation of peace 

the following article is published in the english papers  to excite
the people against the opposition 

 if the marquis of rockingham should come again into the
administration  his first operation would most probably be  to declare
america independent  this would  nevertheless  be a fatal resolution 
which  instead of giving us peace  would throw that event still
farther off  a proof so striking of our pusilanimity would raise still
higher the hopes and the pride of the house of bourbon  france would
demand that we should restore to them canada  cape breton  and nova
scotia  as well as the islands which were taken from her the last war 
nothing less would be necessary for spain than the restitution of
gibraltar and jamaica  but it cannot but be supposed  that the marquis
of rockingham is too much attached to his head to expose it to danger
by so shameful a dismemberment of our empire  he would then make us
continue the war with the disadvantage of not being able any longer to
rein in the americans  who would assist everywhere their allies by
land and by sea  but every englishman of good sense sees to what
disasters this plan of conduct would lead us  the ambition of this
marquis and of his party is not to triumph over rebels  and the
natural enemies of england  it is to humble his king and ruin his
country

  sir 

i have received the two letters  which your excellency did me the
honor to write to me  on the 5th and on the 12th of this month 

i do not mean to give your excellency the trouble of answering these
letters of mine  which contain extracts of letters from abroad  or
simply news  this would be giving your excellency too much trouble 
and taking up too much time  indeed  i think it will very probably be
often  if not always unnecessary  because your excellency s
information must be  beyond all comparison  earlier  more exact  and
more particular than mine  yet  as it is possible that sometimes a
circumstance of importance may escape one channel of intelligence  and
yet pass in another  i thought it to be my duty sometimes to send your
excellency an extract  in this view  i now have the honor to send your
excellency another extract from a letter of the 6th of this month  but
i pray your excellency not to take the trouble to answer it 

  i have the honor to be   c

just sixteen 

a little knight of labor 


the first real snow storm of the winter had come to sandyport by the
sea 

it had been a late and merciful autumn  till well into november the
leaves still clung to their boughs  honeysuckles made shady coverts on
trellises  and put forth now and then an orange and milk white blossom
full of frosty sweetness  the grass was still green where the snow
allowed it to be seen  thick and fast fell the wind blown flakes on the
lightly frozen ground  the patter and beat of the flying storm was a
joyous sound to children who owned sleds and had been waiting the chance
to use them  many a boy s face looked out as the dusk fell  to make sure
that the storm continued  and many a bright voice cried   hurrah  it s
coming down harder than ever  to morrow it will be splendid   stable men
were shaking out fur robes and arranging cutters  already the fitful
sound of sleigh bells could be heard  and all the world  the world of
sandyport that is  was preparing to give the in coming winter a gay
welcome 

but in one house in an old fashioned but still respectable street no one
seemed inclined to join in the general merry making  only two lights
broke its darkness  one shone from the kitchen at the back  where 
beside a kerosene lamp  bethia kendrick  the old time servitor of the
talcott family  was gloomily darning stockings  and otherwise making
ready for departure on the morrow  the other and fainter glow came from
the front room  where without any lamp georgie talcott sat alone beside
her fire 

it was a little fire  and built of rather queer materials  there were
bits of lath and box covers  fence pickets split in two  shavings 
pasteboard clippings  and on top of all  half of an old chopping bowl 
the light material burned out fast  and had to be continually
replenished from the basket which stood on one side the grate 

georgie  in fact  was burning up the odds and ends of her old life
before leaving it behind forever  she was to quit the house on the
morrow  and there was something significant to her  and very sorrowful 
in this disposal of its shreds and fragments  they meant so little to
other people  and so very much to her  the old chopping bowl  for
instance   her thoughts went back from it to the first time she had ever
been permitted to join in the making of the christmas pies  she saw her
mother  still a young woman then  and pretty with the faded elegance
which had been her characteristic  weighing the sugar and plums  and
slicing the citron  while her own daring little hands plied the chopper
in that very bowl  what joy there was in those vigorous dabs and
cross way cuts  how she had liked to do it  and now  the pretty mother 
faded and gray  lay under the frozen turf  on which the snow flakes were
thickly falling  there could be no more christmases for georgie in the
old house  it was sold  and to morrow would close its doors behind her
forever 

she shivered as these thoughts passed through her mind  and rising moved
restlessly toward the window  it was storming faster than ever  the
sight seemed to make the idea of the morrow harder to bear  a big tear
formed in each eye  blurring the white world outside into a dim
grayness  presently one ran down her nose and fell on her hand  she
looked at it with dismay  wiped it hastily off  and went back to the
fire 

 i won t cry  whatever happens  i m resolved on that   she said half
aloud  as she put the other half of the chopping bowl on the waning
blaze  the deep soaked richness of long perished meats was in the old
wood still  it flared broadly up the chimney  georgie again sat down by
the fire and resumed her thinking 

 what am i going to do   she asked herself for the hundredth time   when
my visit to cousin vi is over  i must decide on something  but what  a
week is such a short time in which to settle such an important thing  

it is hard to be confronted at twenty with the problem of one s own
support  georgie hitherto had been as happy and care free as other
girls  her mother  as the widow of a naval officer  was entitled to a
small pension  this  with a very little more in addition  had paid for
georgie s schooling  and kept the old house going in a sufficiently
comfortable though very modest fashion  but mrs  talcott was not by
nature an exemplary manager  it was hard not to overrun here and there 
especially after georgie grew up  and  took her place in society   as
the poor lady phrased it   the place which was rightfully hers as her
father s daughter and the descendant of a long line of talcotts and
chaunceys and wainwrights  she coveted pretty things for her girl  as
all mothers do  and it was too much for her strength always to deny
herself 

so georgie had  just this  and  just that   and being a fresh attractive
creature  and a favorite  made her little go as far as the other girls 
much  and now and again the tiny capital was encroached upon  and then 
and then   this is a world of sorry chances  as the weak and helpless
find to their cost   came the bad year  when the ranscuttle mills passed
their dividend and the stock went down to almost nothing  and then mrs 
talcott s long illness  and then her death  sickness and death are
luxuries which the poor will do well to go without  georgie went over
the calculations afresh as she sat by the fire  and the result came out
just the same  and not a penny better  when she had paid for her
mother s funeral  and all the last bills  she would have exactly a
hundred and seventy five dollars a year to live upon   that and no more 

the furniture   could she get something for that  she glanced round the
room  and shook her head  the articles were neither handsome enough nor
quaint enough to command a good price  she looked affectionately at the
hair cloth sofa on which her mother had so often lain  at the well worn
secretary  how could she part with these  how could she sell her
great grandfather s picture  or who  in fact  except herself  would care
for the rather ill painted portrait of a rigid old worthy of the last
century  in a wig and ruffled shirt  with a view of sandyport harbor by
way of a background  her father s silhouette hung beneath it  with his
sword and a little mezzotint of his ship  these were treasures to her 
but what were they to any one else 

 no   she decided   bethia shall take the old kitchen things and her own
bedroom furniture  and have the use of them  but the rest must go into
miss sally s attic for the present  they wouldn t fetch anything  and if
they would  i don t think i could bear to sell them  and now that is
settled  i must think again  what _am_ i to do  i must do something  

she turned over all manner of schemes in her mind  but all seemed
fruitless  sew  the town was full of sempstresses  georgie knew of half
a dozen who could not get work enough to keep them busy half the time 
teach  she could not  her education in no one respect had been thorough
enough  embroider for the women s exchanges and decorative art
societies  perhaps  but it seemed to her that was the very thing to
which all destitute people with pretensions to gentility fled as a
matter of course  and that the market for tidies and  splashers  and
pine pillows was decidedly overstocked 

 it s no use thinking about it to night   was the sensible decision to
which she at last arrived   i am too tired  i ll get a sound night s
sleep if i can  and put off my worries till i am safely at miss
sally s  

the sound night s sleep stood georgie in good stead  for the morrow
taxed all her powers of endurance  both physical and moral  bethia 
unhappy at losing the home of years  was tearful and fractious to a
degree  sending off the furniture through the deep snow proved a slow
and troublesome matter  the doors necessarily stood open a great deal 
the rooms grew very cold  everything was comfortless and dispiriting 
and underlying all  put aside but never unfelt  was a deep sense of pain
at the knowledge that this was the last day   the very  very last of the
home she had always known  and might know no more 

when the final sledge load creaked away over the hard frozen crust 
georgie experienced a sense of relief 

     the sooner  tis over  the sooner to sleep  

she sang below her breath  everything was in order  she had generalled
all ably  nothing was omitted or forgotten  with steady care she raked
out the fire in the kitchen stove  which the new owner of the house had
taken off her hands  and saw to the fastenings of the windows  then she
tied on her bonnet and black veil  gave the weeping bethia a good by
kiss on the door step  closed and locked the door  and waded wearily
through the half broken paths to the boarding house of miss sally
scannell  where cousin vi  otherwise miss violet talcott  had lived for
years 

no very enthusiastic reception awaited her  cousin vi s invitation had
been given from a sense of duty  she  owed it to the child   she told
herself  as she cleared out a bureau drawer  and made a place for
georgie s trunk in the small third story room which for sixteen years
had represented to her all the home she had known  of course such a
visit must be a brief one 

 so you re come   was her greeting as georgie appeared   i thought you d
be here sooner  but i suppose you ve had a good deal to do  i should
have offered to help if the day had not been so cold  come in and take
your things off  

georgie glanced about her as she smoothed her hair  the room bore the
unmistakable marks of spinsterhood and decayed gentility  it was crammed
with little belongings  some valuable  some perfectly valueless  two or
three pieces of spindle legged and claw footed mahogany made an odd
contrast to the common painted bedroom set  miniatures by malbone and
lovely pale lined mezzotints and line engravings hung on the walls amid
a maze of photographs and japanese fans and christmas cards and chromos 
an indescribable confusion of duds encumbered every shelf and table 
and in the midst sat miss vi s tall  meager  dissatisfied self  with
thin hair laboriously trained after the prevailing fashion  and a dress
whose antique material seemed oddly unsuited to its modern cut and
loopings  somehow the pitifulness of the scene struck georgie afresh 

 shall i ever be like this   she reflected 

 now tell me what has happened since the funeral   said her cousin   i
had neuralgia all last week and week before  or i should have got down
oftener  who has called  have the hanburys been to see you  

 ellen came last week  but i was out   replied georgie 

 what a pity  and how did it happen that you were out  you ought not to
have been seen in the street so soon  i think  it s not customary  

 how could i help it   responded georgie  sadly   i had all the move to
arrange for  mr  custer wanted the house for saturday  there was no one
to go for me  

 i suppose you couldn t  but it s a pity  it s never well to outrage
conventionalities  have mrs  st  john and mrs  constant carrington
called  

 mrs  carrington hasn t  but she wrote me a little note  and dear mrs 
st  john came twice  and brought flowers  and was ever so kind  she
always has been so very nice to me  you know  

 naturally  the st  johns were nobodies till mr  st  john made all that
money in railroads  she is glad enough to be on good terms with the old
families  of course  

 i don t think it s that   said georgie  rather wearily   i think she s
nice because she s naturally so kind hearted  and she likes me  

the tea bell put an end to the discussion  miss sally s welcome was a
good deal warmer than cousin vi s had been 

 you poor dear child   she exclaimed   you look quite tired out  here 
take this seat by the fire  georgie  and i ll pour your tea out first of
all  she needs it  don t she   to cousin vi 

 _miss talcott_ is rather tired  i dare say   said that lady  icily 
cousin vi had lived for sixteen years in daily intercourse with miss
sally  one of the sunniest and most friendly of women  and had never
once relaxed into cordiality in all that time  her code of manners
included no approximation toward familiarity between a talcott and a
letter of lodgings 

georgie took a different view   thank you so much  dear miss sally   she
said   how good you are  i _am_ tired  

 i wish you wouldn t call miss sally  dear    her cousin remarked after
they had gone upstairs   that sort of thing is most disagreeable to me 
you have to be on your guard continually in a house like this  or you
get mixed up with all sorts of people  

georgie let it pass  she was too tired to argue 

 now  let us talk about your plans   miss talcott said next morning 
 have you made any yet  

 n  o  only that i must find some work to do at once  

 don t speak like that to any one but me   her cousin said sharply 
 there _are_ lady like occupations  of course  in which you
can  can  mingle  but they need not be mentioned  or made known to
people in general  

 what _do_ you mean  

 i don t know  i m sure  i ve never had occasion to look into the
matter  but i suppose a girl situated as you are could find
something   embroidery  for instance  you could do that for the
decorative art  they give you a number  and nobody knows your real
name  

 i thought of embroidery   said georgie   but i never was very good at
it  and so many are doing it nowadays  besides  it seems to me that
people are getting rather tired of all but the finer sort of work  

 what became of that nephew of mr  constant carrington whom you used to
see so much of two or three years ago   demanded miss vi  irrelevantly 

 bob curtis  i don t quite know where he is  his father failed  don t
you remember  and lost all his money  and bob had to leave harvard and
go into some sort of business  

 oh  did he  he s of no consequence  then  i don t know what made me
think of him  well  you could read to an invalid  perhaps  or go to
europe with some lady who wanted a companion  

 or be second best wing maker to an angel   put in georgie  with a
little glint of humor   cousin vi  all that would be very pleasant  but
i don t think it is likely to happen  i m dreadfully afraid no one wants
me to go to europe  and i must have something to do at once  you know 
i must earn my bread  

 don t use such a phrase  it sounds too coarse for anything  

 i don t think so  cousin vi  i don t mind working a bit  if only i can
hit on something that somebody wants  and that i can do well  

 this is exactly what i have been afraid of   said miss vi 
despairingly   i ve always had a fear that old jacob talcott would break
out in you sooner or later  he has skipped two generations  but he was
bound to show himself some day or other  he had exactly that common sort
of way of looking at things and talking about them   the only talcott i
ever knew of that did  don t you recollect how he insisted on putting
his son into business  and the boy ran away and went to the west indies
and married some sort of creole   all his father s fault 

 now  i ll tell you   she went on after a pause   i ve been thinking
over this matter  and have made up my mind about it  you re not to do
anything foolish  georgie  if you do  you ll be sorry for it all your
life  and i shall never forgive you besides  such a good start as you
have made in society  and all  it will be quite too much if you go and
spoil your chances with those ridiculous notions of yours  now  listen 
if you ll give up all idea of supporting yourself  unless it is by doing
embroidery or something like that  which no one need know about 
i ll  i ll  well  i ll agree to pay your board here at miss sally s  and
give you half this room for a year  as likely as not you ll be married
by the end of that time  or if not  something else will have turned up 
any way  i ll do it for one year  when the year is over  we can talk
about the next   and miss talcott folded her hands with the manner of
one who has offered an ultimatum 

if rather a grudging  this was a really generous offer  as georgie well
knew  to add the expense of her young cousin s board to her own would
cost miss vi no end of self denials  pinchings here and pinchings there 
the daily frets and calculations that weigh so heavily  miss talcott s
slender income at its best barely sufficed for the narrow lodgings  to
fight off the shabbiness which would endanger her place in  society  
and to pay for an occasional cab and theatre ticket  not to do  or at
least to seem to be doing and enjoying  what other people did  was real
suffering to cousin vi  yet she was deliberately invoking it by her
proposal 

had it been really made for her sake  had it been quite disinterested 
georgie would have been deeply touched and grateful  as it was  she was
sufficiently so to thank her cousin warmly  but without committing
herself to acceptance  she must think it over  she said 

she did think it over till her mind fairly ached with the pressure of
thought  as the body does after too much exercise  she walked past the
woman s exchange and studied the articles in the windows  there were the
same towels and tidies that had been there two months before  or what
seemed the same  georgie recollected similar articles worked by people
whom she knew about  for which she had been asked to buy raffle tickets 
 she can t get any one to buy it   had been said  depending on such work
for a support seemed a bare outlook  she walked away with a little shake
of her head 

 no   she thought   embroidery wouldn t pay unless i had a  gift   and i
don t seem to have a gift for anything unless it is housework  i always
was good at that  but i suppose i can t exactly take a place as
parlor maid  cousin vi would certainly clap me into an asylum if i
suggested such a thing  how nice it would be to have a real genius for
something  though now that i think of it  a good many geniuses have died
in attics  of starvation  without being able to help themselves  

when she reached home she took a pencil and a piece of paper and wrote
as follows   

    _things wanted _

     1  something i can do 

     2  something that somebody wants me to do 

     3  something that all the other somebodies in search of work
     are not trying to do 

round these problems her thoughts revolved  and though nothing came of
them as yet  it seemed to clear her mind to have them set down in black
and white 

meantime the two days  _tête à tête_ with cousin vi produced one
distinct result  which was  that let come what come might  georgie
resolved that nothing should induce her to stay on at miss sally s as
proposed  and be idle  her healthy and vigorous youth recoiled from the
idea 

 it is really good of her to ask me   she thought   though she only does
it for the honor of the family and the dead and gone talcotts  but what
a life it would be  and for a whole year too  cousin vi has stood it for
sixteen  to be sure  poor thing  but how could she  mother used to say
that she was called a bright girl when she first grew up  surely she
might have made something of herself if she had tried  and if aunt
talcott hadn t considered work one of the seven deadly sins for a lady 
she was handsome  too  even i can recollect her as very good looking 
and here she is  all alone  and getting shabbier and poorer all the
time  i know she sometimes has not money enough to pay her board  and
has to ask miss sally to wait  snubbing her and despising her all the
time  and holding on desperately to her little figment of gentility 
people laugh at her and make fun of her behind her back  they invite her
now and then  but they don t really care for her  what is such a society
worth  i ll take in washing before i ll come to be like cousin vi  

                                        

how little we guess  as we grope in the mists of our own uncertainties 
just where the light is going to break through  georgie talcott 
starting for a walk with her cousin on the third day of her stay at
miss sally s  saw the st  john carriage pass them and then pull up
suddenly at the curb stone  but she had no idea that so simple a
circumstance could affect her fate in any manner  it did  though 

mrs  st  john was leaning out of the window before they got to the place
where the carriage stood  and two prettily gloved hands were stretched
eagerly forth 

 georgie  oh georgie  how glad i am to see you out  dear  i made henry
stop  because i want you to get in for a little drive and then come home
with me to lunch  mr  st  john is in new york  i am quite alone  and
i ll give orders that no one shall be admitted  if you will  don t you
think she might  miss talcott  it isn t like going anywhere else  you
know   just coming to me quietly like that  

 i don t see that there would be any impropriety in it   said miss
talcott  doubtfully   though  with you  however  it _is_ different  but
please don t mention it to any one  mrs  st  john  it might be
misunderstood and lead to invitations which georgie could not possibly
accept  good morning  

with a stately bend cousin vi sailed down the street  mrs  st  john  i
am sorry to say  made a face after her as she went 

 absurd old idiot   she muttered   such airs   then she drew georgie in 
and as soon as the carriage was in motion pulled her veil aside and gave
her a warm kiss 

 i am so glad to get hold of you again   she said 

mrs  st  john  rich  childless  warm hearted  and not over wise  had
adopted georgie as a special pet on her first appearance in society two
years before  it is always pleasant for a girl to be made much of by an
older woman  and when that woman has a carriage and a nice house  and
can do all sorts of things for the girl s entertainment  it is none the
less agreeable  georgie was really fond of her friend  people who are
not over wise are often loved as much as wiser ones  it is one of the
laws of compensation 

 now tell me all about yourself  and what you have been doing this past
week   said mrs  st  john  as they drove down to the beach  where the
surf rollers had swept the sands clean of snow and left a dry  smooth
roadway for the horses  feet  the sea wore its winter color that day   a
deep purple blue  broken by flashing foam caps  the wind was blowing
freshly  a great sense of refreshment came to georgie  who had been
wearying for a change 

 it has been rather sad and hard   she said   i have had the house to
clear out and close  and all manner of things to do  and i was pretty
tired when i finished  but i am getting rested now  and by and by i want
to talk over my affairs with you  

 plans   asked mrs  st  john 

 not exactly  i have no plans as yet  but i must have some soon  now
tell me what _you_ have been doing  

mrs  st  john was never averse to talking about herself  she always had
a mass of experiences and adventures to relate  which though
insignificant enough when you came to analyze them  were so deeply
interesting to herself that somehow her auditors got interested in them
also  georgie  used to her ways  listened and sympathized without
effort  keeping her eyes fixed meanwhile on the shining  shifting
horizon of the sea  and the lovely arch of clear morning sky  how wide
and free and satisfactory it was  how different from the cramped outlook
into which she had perforce been gazing for days back 

 if life could all be like that   she thought 

the st  john house seemed a model of winter comfort  bright 
flower scented  and deliciously warm  as they entered it after their
drive  mrs  st  john rang for her maid to take off their wraps  and led
georgie through the drawing room and the library to a smaller room
beyond  which was her favorite sitting place of a morning 

 we will have luncheon here close to the fire   she said   and be as
cosey as possible  

it was a pretty room  not over large  fitted up by a professional
decorator in a good scheme of color  and crowded with ornaments of all
sorts  after the modern fashion  it was many weeks since georgie had
seen it  and its profusion and costliness of detail struck her as it
never had done before  perhaps she was in the mood to observe closely 

they were still sipping their hot _bouillon_ in great comfort  when a
sudden crash was heard in the distance 

 there   said mrs  st  john  resignedly   that s the second since
monday  what is it _now_  pierre  

she pushed back her chair and went hurriedly into the farther room 
presently she came back laughing  but looking flushed and annoyed 

 it s really too vexatious   she said   there seems no use at all in
buying pretty things  the servants do break them so  

 what was it this time   asked georgie 

 it was my favorite bit of sèvres  don t you recollect it   two lovely
little shepherdesses in blue watteaus  holding a flower basket between
them  pierre says his feather duster caught in the open work edge of the
basket  

 why do you let him use feather dusters  the feathers are so apt to
catch  

 my dear  what can i do  each fresh servant has his or her theory as to
how things should be cleaned  whatever the theory is  the china goes all
the same  and i can t tell them any better  i don t know a thing about
dusting  

that moment  as if some quick witted fairy had waved her wand  an idea
darted like a flash into georgie s head 

she took five minutes to consider it  while mrs  st  john went on   

 people talk of the hardship of not being able to have things  but i
think it s just as hard to have them and not be allowed to keep them  i
don t dare to let myself care for a piece of china nowadays  for if i do
it s the first thing to go  pierre s a treasure in other respects  but
he smashes most dreadfully  and the second man is quite as bad  and
marie  upstairs  is worse than either  mr  st  john says i ought to be
 mistress of myself  though china fall   but i really can t  

georgie  who had listened to this without listening  had now made up her
mind 

 would you like me to dust your things   she said quietly 

 my dear  they _are_ dusted  pierre has got through for this time  he
won t break anything more till to morrow  

 oh  i don t mean only to day  i mean every day  yes  i m in earnest  
she went on in answer to her friend s astonished look   i was meaning to
talk to you about something of this sort presently  and now this has
come into my head  you see   smiling bravely   i find that i have got
almost nothing to live upon  there is not even enough to pay my board at
such a place as miss sally s  i must do something to earn money  and
dusting is one of the few things that i can do particularly well  

 but  my dear  i never heard of such a thing   gasped poor mrs  st 
john   surely your friends and connections will arrange something for
you  

 they can t  they are all dead   replied georgie  sadly   our family has
run out  i ve one cousin in china whom i never saw  and one great aunt
down in tennessee who is almost as poor as i am  and that s all except
cousin vi  

 she s no good  of course  but she s sure to object to your doing
anything all the same  

 oh yes  of course she objects   said georgie  impatiently   she would
like to tie my hands and make me sit quite still for a year and see if
something won t happen  but i can t and won t do it  and  besides  what
is there to happen  nothing  she was kind about it  too    relenting 
 she offered to pay my board and share her room with me if i consented 
but i would so much rather get to work at once and be independent  do
let me do your dusting   coaxingly   i ll come every morning and put
these four rooms in nice order  and you need never let pierre or marie
or any one touch the china again  unless you like  i can almost promise
that i won t break anything  

 my dear  it would be beautiful for me  but perfectly horrid for you  i
quite agree with your cousin for once  it will never do in the world for
you to attempt such a thing  people would drop you at once  you would
lose your position and all your chance  if it was known that you were
doing that kind of work  

 but don t you see   cried georgie  kneeling down on the hearth rug to
bring her face nearer to her friend s    don t you see that i ve _got_
to be dropped any way  not because i have done anything  not because
people are unkind  but just from the necessity of things  i have no
money to buy dresses to go out and enjoy myself with  i have no money to
stay at home on  in fact   i _must_ do something  and to live like
cousin vi on the edge of things  just tolerated by people  and mortified
and snubbed  and then have a little crumb of pleasure tossed to me  as
one throws the last scrap of cake that one doesn t want to a cat or a
dog   _that_ is what i could not possibly bear 

 i like fun and pretty things and luxury as well as other people   she
continued  after a little pause   it isn t that i shouldn t _prefer_
something different  but everybody can t be well off and have things
their own way  and since i am one of the rank and file  it seems to me
much wiser to give up the things i _can t_ have  out and out  and not
try to be two persons at once  a young lady and a working girl  but put
my whole heart into the thing i must be  and do it just as well as i
can  don t you see that i am right  

 you poor dear darling   said mrs  st  john  with tears in her eyes 
then her face cleared 

 very well   she said briskly   you _shall_  it will be the greatest
comfort in the world to have you take charge of the ornaments  _now_ i
can buy as many cups and saucers as i like  and with an easy mind  you
must stay and lunch  always  georgie  i ll give you a regular salary 
and when the weather s bad i shall keep you to dinner too  and to spend
the night  that s settled  and now let us decide what i shall give you 
would fifty dollars a month be enough  

 my dear mrs  st  john  fifty  two dollars a week was what i was
thinking of  

 two dollars  oh  you foolish child  you never could live on that  you
don t know anything at all about expenses  georgie  

 but i don t mean only to do _your_ dusting  if you are satisfied  i
depend on your recommending me to your friends  i could take care of
four sets of rooms just as well as of one  there are so many people in
sandyport who have beautiful houses and collections of bric à brac  that
i think there might be as many as that who would care to have me if i
didn t cost too much  four places at two dollars each would make eight
dollars a week  i could live on that nicely  

 i wish you d count me in as four   said mrs  st  john   i should see
four times as much of you  and it would make me four hundred times
happier  

but georgie was firm  and before they parted it was arranged that she
should begin her new task the next morning  and that her friend should
do what she could to find her similar work elsewhere 

her plan once made  georgie suffered no grass to grow under her feet 
on the way home she bought some cheese cloth and a stiff little brush
with a pointed end for carvings  and before the next day had provided
herself with a quantity of large soft dusters and two little phials of
alcohol and oil  and had hunted up a small pair of bellows  which
experience had shown her were invaluable for blowing the dust out of
delicate objects  her first essay was a perfect success  mrs  st  john 
quite at a loss how to face the changed situation  gave her a
half troubled welcome  but georgie s business like methods reassured
her  she followed her about and watched her handle each fragile treasure
with skilful  delicate fingers till all was in perfect fresh order  and
gave a great sigh of admiration and relief when the work was done 

 now come and sit down   she said   how tired you must be  

 not a bit   declared georgie   i like to dust  strange to say  and i m
not tired at all  i only wish i had another job just like it to do at
once  i see it s what i was made for  

by the end of the week georgie had another regular engagement  and it
became necessary to break the news of her new occupation to cousin vi 
i regret to say that the disclosure caused an  unpleasantness   between
them 

 i would not have believed such a thing possible even with you  
declared that lady with angry tears   the very idea marks you out as a
person of low mind  it s enough to make your grandmother talcott rise
from her grave  in the name of common decency  couldn t you hunt up
something to do  if do you must  except this  

 nothing that i could do so well and so easily  cousin vi  

 don t call me cousin vi  i beg  there was no need of doing anything
whatever  i asked you to stay here   you cannot deny that i did  

 i don t wish to deny it   said georgie  gently   it was ever so kind of
you  too  don t be so vexed with me  cousin vi  we look at things
differently  and i don t suppose either of us can help it  but don t let
us quarrel  you re almost the only relative that i have in the world  

 quarrel   cried miss talcott with a shrill laugh    quarrel with a girl
that goes out dusting  that isn t in my line  i am happy to say  as for
being relatives  we are so no longer  and i shall say so to everybody 
great heavens  what will people think  

after this outburst it was evident to georgie that it was better that
she should leave miss sally s as soon as possible  but where to go  she
consulted miss sally  that astute person comprehended the situation in
the twinkling of an eye  and was ready with a happy suggestion 

 there s my brother john s widder in the lower street   she said   she s
tolerably well off  and hasn t ever taken boarders  but she s a sort of
lonesome person  and i shouldn t wonder if i could fix it so she d feel
like taking you  and reasonable too  it s mighty handy about that
furniture of yours  for her upstairs rooms ain t got nothing in them to
speak of  and of course she wouldn t want to buy  i ll step down after
dinner and see about it  

miss sally was a power in her family circle  and she knew it  before
night she had talked mrs  john scannell into the belief that to take
georgie to board at five dollars a week was the thing of all others that
she most wanted to do  and before the end of two days all was arranged 
and georgie inducted into her new quarters  it was a little low pitched 
old fashioned house  but it had some pleasant features  and was very
neat  a big corner room with a window to the south and another to the
sunset was assigned to georgie for her bedroom  the old furniture that
she had been used to all her life made it look homelike  and the
hair cloth sofa and the secretary and square mahogany table were welcome
additions to the rather scantily furnished sitting room below  which she
shared at will with her hostess  mrs  scannell was a gentle  kindly
woman  the soul of cleanliness and propriety  but subject to low
spirits  and contact with georgie s bright  hopeful youth was as
delightful to her as it was beneficial  she soon became very fond of  my
young lady   as she called her  and georgie could not have been better
placed as to kindness and comfortableness 

a better place than sandyport for just such an experiment as she was
making could scarcely have been found  many city people made it their
home for the summer  but at all times of the year there was a
considerable resident population of wealthy people  luxurious homes were
rather the rule than the exception  and there was quite a little
rivalry as to elegance of appointment among them  mrs  st  john s
enthusiasm and mrs  st  john s recommendation bore fruit  and it was not
long before georgie had secured her coveted  four places  

two of her employers were comparative strangers  with the fourth  mrs 
constant carrington  she had been on terms of some intimacy in the old
days  but was not much so now  it _is_ rather difficult to keep up
friendship with your  dusting girl   as her cousin vi would have said 
mrs  carrington called her  georgie  still  when they met  and was
perfectly civil in her manners  but always there was the business
relation to stand between them  and georgie felt it  mrs  st  john still
tried to retain the pretty pretext that georgie s labors were a sort of
joke  a playing with independence  but there was nothing of this pretext
with the other three  to them  georgie was simply a useful adjunct to
their luxurious lives  as little to be regarded as the florist who
filled their flower boxes or the man who tuned their pianos 

these little rubs to self complacency were not very hard to bear  it was
not exactly pleasant  certainly  to pass in at the side entrance where
she had once been welcomed at the front door  to feel that her comings
and her goings were so insignificant as to be scarcely noticed  now and
then  perhaps  to be treated with scant courtesy by an ill mannered
servant  this rarely chanced  however  georgie had a little natural
dignity which impressed servants as well as other people  and from her
employers she received nothing but the most civil treatment  fashion is
not unkindly  and it was still remembered that miss talcott was born a
lady  though she worked for a living  there were stormy days and dull
days  days when georgie felt tired and discouraged  or  harder still to
bear  bright days and gala days  when she saw other girls of her age
setting forth to enjoy themselves in ways now closed to her  i will not
deny that she suffered at such moments  and wished with all her heart
that things could be different  but on the whole she bore herself
bravely and well  and found some happiness in her work  together with a
great deal of contentment 

mrs  st  john added to her difficulties by continual efforts to tempt
her to do this and that pleasant thing which georgie felt to be
inexpedient  she wanted her favorite to play at young ladyhood in her
odd minutes  and defy the little frosts and chills which georgie
instinctively knew would be her portion if she should attempt to enter
society again on the old terms  if georgie urged that she had no proper
dress  the answer was prompt    my dear  i am going to give you a
dress   or   my dear  you can wear my blue  we are just the same
height   but georgie stood firm  warded off the shower of gifts which
was ready to descend upon her  and loving her friend the more that she
was so foolishly kind  would not let herself be persuaded into doing
what she knew was unwise 

 i can t be two people at once   she persisted   there s not enough of
me for that  you remember what i said that first day  and i mean to
stick to it  you are a perfect darling  and just as kind as you can be 
but you must just let me go my own way  dear mrs  st  john  and be
satisfied to know that it is the comfort of my life to have you love me
so much  though i won t go to balls with you  

but though georgie would not go to balls or dinner parties  there were
smaller gayeties and pleasures which she did not refuse   drives and
sails now and then  tickets to concerts and lectures  or a long quiet
sunday with a  spend the night  to follow  these little breaks in her
busy life were wholesome and refreshing  and she saw no reason for
denying them to herself  there was nothing morbid in my little knight of
labor  which was one reason why she labored so successfully 

so the summer came and went  and georgie with it  keeping steadily on at
her daily task  all that she found to do she did as thoroughly and as
carefully as she knew how  she was of real use  and she knew it  her
work had a value  it was not imaginary work  invented as a pretext for
giving her help  and the fact supported her self respect 

we are told in one of our lord s most subtly beautiful parables  that to
them who make perfect use of their one talent  other talents shall be
added also  many faithful workers have proved the meaning and the truth
of the parable  and georgie talcott found it now among the rest  with
the coming in of the autumn another sphere of activity was suddenly
opened to her  it sprang  as good things often do  from a seeming
disappointment 

she was drawing on her gloves one morning at the close of her labors 
when a message was brought by the discreet english butler 

 mrs  parish says  miss  will you be so good as to step up to her
morning room before you go  

 certainly  frederick   and georgie turned and ran lightly upstairs 
mrs  parish was sitting at her writing table with rather a preoccupied
face 

 i sent for you  miss talcott  because i wanted to mention that we are
going abroad for the winter   she began   maud isn t well  the doctors
recommend the riviera  so we have decided rather suddenly on our plans 
and are to sail on the  scythia  the first of november  we shall be gone
a year  

 dear me   thought georgie   there s another of my places lost  it is
quite dreadful   she was conscious of a sharp pang of inward
disappointment 

 my cousin  mrs  ernest stockton  is to take the place   continued mrs 
parish   her husband has been in the legation at paris  you know  for
the last six years  but now they are coming back for good  and when i
telegraphed her of our decision  she at once cabled to secure this
house  they will land the week after we sail  and i suppose will want
to come up at once  now  of course all sorts of things have got to be
done to make ready for them  but it s out of the question that i should
do them  for what with packing and the children s dressmaking and
appointments at the dentist s and all that  my hands are so full that i
could not possibly undertake anything else  so i was thinking of you 
you have so much head and system  you know  and i could trust you as i
could not any stranger  and you know the house so well  and you could
get plenty of people to help  so that it need not be burdensome  there
will be some things to be packed away  and the whole place to be
cleaned  floors waxed and curtains washed  the duchesse dressing tables
taken to pieces and done up and fluted   all that sort of thing  you
know  oh  and there would be an inventory to make  too  i forgot that 
then next year i should want it gone over again in the same way   the
articles that are packed taken out and put into place  and so on  that
it may look natural when we come home  my idea would be to move the
family down to new york on the 15th  so as to give you a clear
fortnight  and just come up for one day before we sail  for a final
look  of course i should leave the keys in your charge  and i should
want you to take the whole responsibility  now  will you do it  and just
tell me what you will ask for it all  

 may i think it over for one night   said prudent georgie   i will come
to morrow morning with my answer  

she thought it over carefully  and seemed to see that here was a new
vista of remunerative labor opened to her  of a more permanent character
than mere dusting  so she signified to mrs  parish that she would
undertake the job  and having done so  bent her mind to doing it in the
best possible manner  she made careful lists  and personally
superintended each detail  miss sally recommended trustworthy
workpeople  and everything was carried out to the full satisfaction of
mrs  parish  who could not say enough in praise of georgie and her
methods 

 it robs going to europe of half its terrors to have such a person to
turn to   she told her friends   that little miss talcott is really
wonderful   so clear headed and exact  it s really extraordinary where
she learned it all  such a girl as she is  if any of you are going
abroad  you ll find her the greatest comfort possible  

these commendations bore fruit  people in sandyport were always setting
forth for this part of the world or that  and leaving houses behind
them  a second job of the same sort was soon urged upon georgie 
followed by a third and a fourth  it was profitable work  for she had
fifty dollars in each case  a hundred for her double job at the algernon
parishes    so her year s expenses were assured  and she was not sorry
when another of her  dusting  families went to florida for the winter 

it became the fashion in sandyport to employ  little miss talcott   her
capabilities once discovered  people were quick in finding out ways in
which to utilize them  mrs  robert brown had the sudden happy thought of
getting georgie to arrange the flowers for a ball which she was giving 
georgie loved flowers  and had that knack of making them look charming
in vases which is the gift of a favored few  the ball decorations were
admired and commented upon  people said it was  so clever of mrs 
brown   and  so much better than stiff things from a florist s   and
presently half a dozen other ladies wanted the same thing done for
them  fashion and sheep always follow any leader who is venturesome
enough to try a new fence 

later  mrs  horace brown  with her cards out for a great lawn party  had
the misfortune to sprain her ankle  in this emergency she bethought
herself of georgie  who thereupon proved so  invaluable  as a _dea ex
machina_ behind the scenes  that thenceforward mrs  brown never felt
that she could give any sort of entertainment without her help 
engagements thickened  and georgie s hands became so full that she
laughingly threatened to  take a partner  

 that s just what i always wanted you to do   said mrs  st  john    a
real nice one  with heaps of money  who would take you about everywhere 
and give you a good time  

 oh  that s not at all the sort i want   protested georgie  laughing and
blushing   i mean a real business partner  a fellow sweeperess and
house arranger and ball supper manageress  

 wretched girl  how horribly practical you are  i wish i could see you
discontented and sentimental just for once  

 heaven forbid  that _would_ be a pretty state of things  now good by  i
have about half a ton of roses to arrange for mrs  lauriston  

 oh   for her dance  georgie   coaxingly   why not go for once with me 
come  just this once  there s that white dress of mine from _pingat_ 
with the _point de venie_ sleeves  that would exactly fit you  

 nonsense   replied georgie  briefly  she kissed her friend and hurried
away 

 i declare   soliloquized mrs  st  john  looking after her   i could
find it in my heart to _advertise_ for some one to come and rescue
georgie talcott from all this hard work  what nice old times those were
when you had only to get up a tournament and blow a trumpet or two  and
have true knights flock in from all points of the compass in aid of
distressed damsels  i wish such things were in fashion now  i would buy
a trumpet this very day  i vow  and have a tournament next week  

georgie s true knight  as it happened  was to come from a quarter little
suspected by mrs  st  john  for the spare afternoons of this second
winter georgie had reserved rather a large piece of work  which had
the advantage that it could be taken up at will and laid down when
convenient  this was the cataloguing of a valuable library belonging to
mr  constant carrington  that gentleman had observed georgie rather
closely as she went about her various avocations  and had formed so high
an opinion of what he was pleased to term her  executive ability   that
he made a high bid for her services in preference to those of any one
else 

 illustration  recognizing an old friend  she jumped up  exclaiming 
 why bob  mr  curtis  how do you do    _page 49 _ 

she was sitting in this library one rainy day in january  beside a big
packing case  with a long row of books on the table  which she was
dusting  classifying  and noting on the list in her lap  when the door
opened and a tall young man came in  georgie glanced at him vaguely  as
at a stranger  then recognizing an old friend  she jumped up 
exclaiming   why bob  mr  curtis   how do you do  i had no idea that you
were here  

bob curtis looked bewildered  he had reached sandyport only that
morning  no one had chanced to mention georgie or the change in her
fortunes  and for a moment he failed to recognize in the white aproned 
dusty fingered vision before him the girl whom he had known so well five
years previously 

 it is   why it _is_   he exclaimed   miss georgie  how delighted i am
to see you  i was coming down to call as soon as i could find out where
you were  my aunt said nothing about your being in the house  

 very likely she did not know  i am in and out so often here that i do
not always see mrs  carrington  

 indeed   bob looked more puzzled than ever  he had not remembered that
there was any such close intimacy in the old days between the two
families 

 i can t shake hands  i am too dusty   went on georgie   but i am very
glad indeed to see you again  

she too was taking mental notes  and observing that her former friend
had lost somewhat of the gloss and brilliance of his boyish days  that
his coat was not of the last cut  and that his expression was
spiritless  not to say discontented   poor fellow   she thought 

 what on earth does it all mean   meditated bob on his part 

 these books only came yesterday   said georgie  indicating the big box
with a wave of the hand 

 i have had to dust them all  and i find that italian dust sticks just
as the american variety does  and makes the fingers just as black   a
little laugh 

 what _are_ you doing  if i may be so bold as to ask  

 cataloguing your uncle s library  he has been buying quantities of
books for the last two years  as perhaps you know  he has a man in
germany and another in paris and another in london  who purchase for
him  and the boxes are coming over almost every week now  a great case
full of the english ones arrived last saturday   such beauties  look at
that ruskin behind you  it is the first edition  with all the plates 
worth its weight in gold  

 it s awfully good of you to take so much trouble  i m sure   remarked
mr  curtis politely  still with the same mystified look 

 not at all   replied georgie  coolly   it s all in my line of business 
you know  mr  carrington is to give me a hundred dollars for the job 
which is excellent pay  because i can take my own time for doing it  and
work at odd moments  

her interlocutor looked more perplexed than ever  a distinct
embarrassment became visible in his manner at the words  job  and  pay  

 certainly   he said  then coloring a little he frankly went on   i
don t understand a bit  would you mind telling me what it all means  

 oh  you haven t happened to hear of my  befalments   as miss sally
scannell would call them  

 i did hear of your mother s death   said bob  gently   and i was truly
sorry  she was so kind to me always in the old days  

 she was kind to everybody  i am glad you were sorry   said georgie 
bright tears in the eyes which she turned with a grateful look on bob 
 well  that was the beginning of it all  

there was another pause  during which bob pulled his moustache
nervously  then he drew a chair to the table and sat down 

 can you talk while you re working   he asked   and mayn t i help  it
seems as though i might at least lift those books out for you  now  if
you don t mind  if it isn t painful  won t you tell me what has happened
to you  for i see that something _has_ happened  

 a great deal has happened  but it isn t painful to tell about it 
things _were_ puzzling at first  but they have turned out wonderfully 
and i m rather proud of the way they have gone  

so  little by little  with occasional interruptions for lifting out
books and jotting down titles  she told her story  won from point to
point by the eager interest which her companion showed in the narrative 
when she had finished  he brought his hand down heavily on the table 

 i ll tell you what   he exclaimed with vigorous emphasis   it s most
extraordinary that a girl should do as you have done  you re an absolute
little _brick_   if you ll excuse the phrase  but it makes a fellow  it
makes _me_ more ashamed of myself than i ve often been in my life
before  

 but why   why should you be ashamed  

 oh  i ve been having hard times too   explained bob  gloomily   but i
haven t been so plucky as you  i ve minded them more  

georgie knew vaguely something of these  hard times   in the  old days  
five years before  when she was seventeen and he a harvard junior of
twenty  spending a long vacation with his uncle  and when they had
rowed and danced and played tennis together so constantly as to set
people to wondering if anything  serious  was likely to arise from the
intimacy  the world with all its opportunities and pleasures seemed open
to the heir of the curtis family  bob s father was rich  the family
influential  there seemed nothing that he might not command at will 

then all was changed suddenly  a great financial panic swept away the
family fortunes in a few weeks  mr  curtis died insolvent  and robert
was called on to give up many half formed wishes and ambitions  and face
the stern realities  what little could be saved from the wreck made a
scanty subsistence for his mother and sisters  he must support himself 
for more than two years he had been filling a subordinate position in a
large manufacturing business  his friends considered him in luck to
secure such a place  and he was fain to agree with them  but the
acknowledgment did not make him exactly happy in it  notwithstanding 

discipline can hardly be agreeable  bob curtis had been a little spoiled
by prosperity  and though he did his work fairly well  there was always
a bitterness at heart  and a certain tinge of false shame at having it
to do at all  he worked because he must  he told himself  not because he
liked or ever should like it  all the family traditions were opposed to
work  then he had the natural confidence of a very young man in his own
powers  and it was not pleasant to be made to feel at every turn that he
was raw  inexperienced  not particularly valuable to anybody  and that
no one especially looked up to or admired him  he scorned himself for
minding such things  but all the same he did mind them  and the frank 
kindly young fellow was in danger of becoming soured and cynical in his
lonely and uncongenial surroundings 

it was just at this point that good fortune brought him into contact
with georgie talcott  and it was like the lifting of a veil from before
his eyes  he recollected her such a pretty  care free creature  petted
and adored by her mother  every day filled with pleasant things  not a
worry or cloud allowed to shadow the bright succession of her
amusements  and here she sat telling him of a fight with necessity
compared with which his seemed like child s play  and out of which she
had come victorious  he was struck  too  with the total absence of
embarrassment and false shame in the telling  work  in georgie s mind 
was evidently a thing to be proud of and thankful over  not something to
be practised shyly  and alluded to with bated breath  the contrast
between his and her way of looking at the thing struck him sharply 

it did not take long for georgie to arrive at the facts in bob s case 
confidence begets confidence  and in another day or two  won by her
bright sympathy  he gradually made a clean breast of his troubles 
somehow they did not seem so great after they were told  georgie s
sympathy was not of a weakening sort  and her questions and comments
seemed to clear things to his mind  and set them in right relations to
each other 

 i don t think that i pity you much   she told him one day   your mother
and the girls  yes  because they are women and not used to it  and it
always _is_ harder for girls   

 see here  you re a girl yourself   put in bob 

 no  i m a business person  don t interrupt  what i was going to say
was  that i think it s _lovely_ for a young man to have to work  we are
all lazy by nature  we need to be shaken up and compelled to do our
best  you will be ten times as much of a person in the end as if you had
always had your own way  

 do you really think that  but what s the use of talking  i may stick
where i am for years  and never do more than just make a living  

 i wouldn t   said georgie  throwing back her pretty head with an air of
decision   i should scorn to  stick  if i were a man  and i don t
believe you will either  if you once go into it heartily and put your
will into it  you re sure to succeed  i always considered you clever 
you know  you ll go up  up  as sure as  as sure as _dust_   that s the
thing of all the world that s most certain to rise  i think  

  overmastered with a clod of valiant marl    muttered robert below his
breath  then aloud   well  if that s the view you take of it  i ll do my
best to prove you right  it s worth a good deal to know that there is
somebody who expects something of me  

 i expect everything of you   said georgie confidently  and bob went
back to his post at the end of the fortnight infinitely cheered and
heartened 

 bless her brave little heart   he said to himself   i won t disappoint
her if i can help it  or  if i must  i ll know the reason why  

it is curious  and perhaps a little humiliating  to realize how much our
lives are affected by what may be called accident  a touch here or
there  a little pull up or down to set us going  often determines the
direction in which we go  and direction means all  robert curtis in
after times always dated the beginning of his fortunes from the day when
he walked into his uncle s library and found georgie talcott cataloguing
books 

 it set me to making a man of myself   he used to say 

georgie did not see him for more than a year after his departure  but he
wrote twice to say that he had taken her advice and it had  worked   and
he had  got a rise   the truth was that the boy had an undeveloped
capacity for affairs  inherited from the able old grandfather  who laid
the foundations of the fortune which bob s father muddled away  when
once will and energy were roused and brought into play  this hereditary
bent asserted itself  bob became valuable to his employers  and like
georgie s  dust   began to go up in the business scale 

georgie had just successfully re established the algernon parishes  who
arrived five months later than was expected  in their home  when bob
came up for a second visit to his uncle  this time he had three weeks 
leave  and it was just before he went back that he proposed the
formation of what he was pleased to call  a labor union  

 you see i m a working man now just as you are a working woman   he
explained   it s our plain duty to co operate  you shall be grand
master  or rather mistress  and i ll be some sort of a subordinate   a
walking delegate  perhaps  

 indeed  you shall be nothing of the sort  walking delegates are
particularly idle people  i ve always heard  they just go about ordering
other folks to stop work and do nothing  

 then i won t be one  i ll be grand master s mate  

 there s no such office in labor unions  if we have one at all  you must
have the first place in it  

 what is that position  please describe it in full  whatever happens  i
won t strike  

 oh   said georgie  with the prettiest blush in the world   the position
is too intricate for explanation  we won t describe it  

 but will you join the union  

 i thought we had joined already   both of us  

 now  georgie  dearest  i m in earnest  thanks to you  i know what work
means and how good it is  and now i want my reward  which is to work
beside you always as long as i live  don t turn away your head  but tell
me that i may  

i cannot tell you exactly what was georgie s answer  for this
conversation took place on the beach  and just then they sat down on the
edge of a boat and began to talk in such low tones that no one could
overhear  but as they sat a long time and she went home leaning
contentedly on bob s arm  i presume she answered as he wished  he went
back to his work soon afterward  and has made his way up very fast
since  next spring the firm with which he is connected propose to send
him to chicago to start a new branch of their business there  he is to
have a good salary and a share of the profits  and it is understood that
georgie will go with him  she has kept on steadily at her various
avocations  has made herself so increasingly useful that all sandyport
wonders what it shall do without her when she goes away  and has laid up
what miss sally calls  a tidy bit of money  toward the furnishing of the
home which she and bob hope to have before long  mrs  st  john has many
plans in mind for the wedding  and though georgie laughingly protests
that she means to be married in a white apron  with a wreath of  dusty
miller  round her head  i dare say she will give in when the time comes 
and consent to let her little occasion be made pretty  even a girl who
works likes to have her marriage day a bright one 

cousin vi  for her part  is dimly reaching out toward a reconciliation 
for  be it known  work which brings success  and is proved to have a
solid money value of its own  loses in the estimation of the fastidious
its degrading qualities  and is spoken of by the more euphonious title
of  good fortune   it is only work which doesn t succeed  which remains
forever disrespectable  i think i may venture to predict that the time
will come when cousin vi will condone all georgie s wrong doings  and
extend  not the olive branch only  but both hands  to  the curtises  
that is if they turn out as prosperous as their friends predict and
expect them to be 

but whatever fate may have in store for my dear little georgie and her
chosen co worker  of one thing i am sure   that  fare as they may with
worldly fortune  they will never be content  having tasted of the salt
of work  to feed again on the honey bread of idleness  or become drones
in the working hive  but will persevere to the end in the principles and
practices of what in the best sense of the word may be called their
labor union 




snowy peter 


the weather was very cold  though it was not christmas yet  and to the
great delight of the kane children  december had brought an early and
heavy fall of snow  older people were sorry  they grieved for the swift
vanishing of the lovely indian summer  for the blighting of the last
flowers  chrysanthemums  snow berries  bitter sweet  and for the red
leaves  so pretty but a few days since  which were now blown about and
battered by the strong wind  but the children wasted no sympathy on
either leaves or berries  a snow storm seemed to them just then better
than anything that ever grew on bush or tree  and they revelled in it
all the long afternoon without a thought of what it had cost the world 

it was a deep snow  it lay over the lawn six inches on a level  in the
hollow by the fence the drifts were at least two feet deep  there was
no lack of building material therefore when reggie proposed that they
should all go to work and make a fort 

such a wonderful fort as it turned out to be  it had walls and bastions
and holes for cannon  it had cannon too  all made of snow  it had a
gateway  just like a real fort  and a flag staff and a flag  the staff
was a tall slender column of snow  and they poured water over it  and it
froze and became a long pole of glittering ice  the flag had a
swallow tail and was icy too  reggie had been in new london and newport
the last summer  he had seen real fortifications and knew how they
should look  under his direction the little ones built a _glacis_  some
of you will know what that is   the steep slippery grass slope which
lies beneath the fort walls and is so hard to climb  this _glacis_ was
harder yet  snow is better than grass for defensive purposes  if only it
would last 

 now let s make the soldiers   shouted little paul as the last
shovel full of snow was spread on the _glacis_ and smoothed down 

 oh  paul  we can t  there won t be time   said elma  the biggest girl 
glancing apprehensively at the sun  which was nearing the edge of the
sky   it must be five o clock  and nurse will call us almost right
away  

 oh  bother  i wish the days weren t so short   said paul
discontentedly   let s make one man  any way  just for a sentry  you
know  there ought to be a sentry to take care of the fort  can t we 
elma  

 yes  only we must hurry  

the small crew precipitated itself on the drift  none of them were cold 
for exercise had warmed their blood  the little ones gathered great
snowballs and rolled them up to the fort  while the big ones shaped and
moulded  in a wonderfully short time the  man  was completed   eyes 
nose  and all  and the gun in his hand  a pipe was put into his mouth  a
cocked hat on his head  elma curled his hair a little  susan sunflower 
as the round faced younger girl was called for fun  patted and smoothed
his cheeks and forehead with her warm little hands  they made boots for
him  and a coat with buttons on the tail pocket  he was a beautiful man
indeed  just as the last touch was given  a window opened and nurse s
head appeared   the very thing the children had been dreading 

 come  children  come in to supper   she called out across the snow 
 it s nearly half past five  you ought to have come in half an hour ago 
miss susan  stop working in that snow  nasty cold stuff  you ll catch
your death  master reggie  make the little boys hurry  please  

there was never any appeal from nurse freeman s decisions  least of all
now when papa and mamma were both away  and she ruled the house as its
undisputed autocrat  even reggie  on the verge of twelve  dare not
disobey her  she was english and a martinet  and had been in charge of
the children all their lives  but she was kind as well as strict  and
they loved her  reluctantly the little troop prepared to go  they picked
up the shovels and baskets  for nurse freeman was very particular about
fetching things in and putting them in their places  they took a last
regretful look at their fort  paul climbed the wall for one more jump
down  little harry indulged in a final slide across the _glacis_  susan
sunflower stroked the sentinel s hand   good night  snowy peter   they
cried in chorus  for that was the name they had agreed upon for their
soldier  then they ran across the lawn in a long skurrying line like a
covey of birds  there was a scraping of feet on the porch  the side door
closed with a bang  and they were gone 

left to himself  snowy peter stood still in his place beside the gateway
of the fortification  snowmen usually do stand still  at least till the
time comes for them to melt and run away  so there was nothing strange
in that  what _was_ singular was that about an hour after the children
had left him  when dusk had closed in over the house and the leafless
trees  and  fort kane  had grown a vague dim shape  he slowly turned his
head  it was as though the fingers of little susan had communicated
something of their warmth and fulness of life to the poor senseless
figure while working over it  and this influence was beginning to take
effect  he turned his head and looked in the direction of the house  all
was dark except for the hall lamp below  which shone through the glass
panes above the door  and for two windows in the second story out of
which streamed a strong yellow light  these were the windows of the
nursery  where  at that moment  the children were eating their supper 

snowy peter remained for a time in motionless silence looking at the
window  then his body slowly began to turn  following the movement of
its head  he lifted one stiff ill shaped foot and moved a step forward 
then he lifted the other and took another step  his left arm dangled
uselessly  the right hand held out the gun which paul had made  and
which was of the most curious shape  the tracks which he left in the
snow as he crossed the lawn resembled the odd  waddling tracks of a
flat footed elephant as much as anything else 

it took him a long  long time to cross the space over which the light
feet of the children had run in two minutes  each step seemed to cost
him a mighty effort  the right leg would quiver for a moment  then wave
wildly to and fro  then with a sort of galvanic jerk project itself  and
the whole body  with a pitch and a lurch  would plunge forward heavily 
till brought up again in an upright position by the advanced leg  after
that the left leg would take its turn  and the process be repeated 
there was no spring  no supple play to the joints  in fact  snowy peter
had no joints  his young creators had left them out while constructing
him 

at last he reached the wall of the house  and stood beneath the windows
where the yellow light was burning  this had been the goal of his
desires  but  alas  now that he had attained the coveted position he
could not look in at the windows  he was far too short  desperation lent
him energy  a stout lattice was nailed against the house  up which in
summer a flowering clematis twined and clustered  seizing this  snowy
peter began to climb 

up one bar after another he slowly and painfully went  lifting his heavy
feet and clinging tightly with his poor  stiff hands  his gun stock
snapped in the middle  his cocked hat sustained many contusions  even
his nose had more than one hard knock  but he had the heart of a hero 
whom neither danger  nor difficulty  nor personal inconvenience can
deter  and at last his head was on a level with the nursery window sill 

it was a pleasant sight that met his eyes  no one had slept in the
nursery since paul had grown big enough for a bed of his own  and though
it kept its own name  it was in reality only a big  cheerful upstairs
sitting room  where lessons could be studied  meals taken  and nurse
freeman sit and do her mending and be on hand always for any one who
wanted her  now that mr  and mrs  kane were absent  the downstairs rooms
looked vacant and dreary  and the children spent all their evenings in
the nursery from preference  a large fire burned briskly in the ample
grate  a kettle hissed and bubbled on the hob  on the round table where
the lamp stood  was a row of bright little tin basins just emptied of
the smoking hot bread and milk which was the usual nursery supper  nurse
was cutting slices from a big brown loaf and buttering them with nice
yellow butter  there was also some gingerbread  and by way of special
and particular treat  a pot of strawberry jam  to which paul at that
moment was paying attention 

he had scooped out such an enormous spoonful as to attract the notice of
the whole party  and just as snowy peter raised his white staring eyes
above the sill  reggie called out   hullo  i say  leave a little of that
for somebody else  will you  

 piggy wiggy   remarked harry  indignantly   and it s your second help
too  

 master paul  i m surprised at you   observed nurse freeman severely 
taking the big spoonful away from him   there  that s quite enough  
and she put half the quantity on the edge of his plate and gave the
other half to susan 

 that s not fair   remonstrated paul   when i ve been working so hard 
and it s so cold  and when i like jam so  and when it s so awfully good
beside  

 jam  what is jam   thought snowy peter  he pressed his cold nose closer
to the glass 

 we all worked hard  paul   said elma   and we all like jam as much as
you do  may i have some more  nursey  

 i wonder how poor snowy peter feels all alone out there in the garden  
said susan sunflower   he must be very cold  poor fellow  

 ho  he don t mind it   declared paul with his mouth full of
bread and jam 

 oh  yes  i do  i mind it very much   murmured snowy peter to himself 
but he had no voice with which to make an outward noise 

 won t you come out and see him to morrow  nursey   went on susan   he s
the best man we ever made  he s quite beautiful  he s got a pipe and a
hat and curly hair and buttons on his coat  i m sure you ll like him  

snowy peter reared himself straighter on the lattice  he was proud to
hear himself thus commended 

 if he could only talk and walk  he d be just as good as a live person 
really he would  nursey   said elma   wouldn t it be fun if he could 
we d bring him in to tea and he d sit by the fire and warm his hands 
and it would be such fun  

 he d melt fast enough in this warm room   observed reggie  while nurse
freeman added   that s nonsense  miss elma  how could a man like that
walk  and i don t want no nasty snow images in _my_ nursery  melting and
slopping up the carpet  

snowy peter listened to this conversation with a painful feeling at his
heart  he felt lonely and forlorn  no one really liked him  to the
children he was only a thing to be played with and joked about  nurse
freeman called him a  nasty snow image   but though he was hurt and
troubled in his spirit  the warm bright nursery  the sound of laughter
and human voices  even the fire  that foe most fatal of all to things
made of snow  had an irresistible attraction for him  he could not bear
the idea of returning to his cold post of duty beside the lonely fort 
and under the wintry midnight sky  so he still clung to the lattice and
looked in at the window with his unwinking eyes  and a great longing to
be inside  and to sit down by the cheerful fire and be treated with
kindness  took possession of him  but what is the use of such ambitions
to a snow man 

long  long he clung to the lattice and lingered and looked in  he saw
the two little ones when first the sand man began to drop his grains
into their eyes  and noticed how they struggled against the sleepy
influence  and tried to keep awake  he saw nurse freeman carry them off 
and presently fetch them back in their flannel nightgowns to say their
prayers beside the fire  snowy peter did not know what it meant as they
knelt with their heads in nursey s lap  and their pink toes curled up in
the glow of the heat  but it was a pretty sight to see  and he liked it 

after they were taken away for the second time  he watched elma as she
studied her geography lesson for the morrow  while reggie did sums on
his slate  and paul played at checkers with susan sunflower  snowy peter
thought he should like to do sums  and he was sure it would be nice to
play checkers  and jump squares and chuckle and finally beat  as paul
did  alas  checkers are not for snow men  paul went to bed when the game
was ended  and susan  and a little later the other two followed  then
nurse freeman raked out the fire and put ashes on top  and blew the
lights out and went away herself  leaving the nursery dark and silent
except for a dim glow from the ash smothered grate and the low ticking
of the clock 

some time after she departed  when the lights in the other windows had
all been extinguished and the house was as dark inside as the night was
outside  snowy peter raised his hand and pushed gently at the sash  it
was not fastened  and it opened easily and without much noise  then a
heavy leg was thrown over the sill  and stiffly and painfully the snow
soldier climbed into the room  he wanted to feel what it was like to sit
in a chair beside a table as human beings sit  and he was extremely
curious about the fire 

alas  he could not sit  he was made to stand but not to bend  when he
tried to seat himself his body lay in a long inclined plane  with the
shoulder blades resting on the back of the chair  and the legs sticking
out straight before him   an attitude which was not at all comfortable 
the chair creaked beneath him and tipped dangerously  it was with
difficulty that he got again into his natural position  and he trembled
with fear in every limb  it had been a narrow escape   a fine thing it
would have been if i had fallen over and not been able to get on my feet
again   he thought   how that terrible old woman would have swept me up
in the morning   then  cautiously and timidly  he put his finger into
the nearly empty jam pot  rubbed it round till a little of the sweet 
sticky juice adhered to it  and raised it to his lips  it had no taste
to him  jam was a human joy in which he could not share  and he heaved a
deep sigh 

drops began to stand on his forehead  though there was so little fire
left  the room was much warmer than the outer air  and snowy peter had
begun to melt  a great and sudden fear took possession of him  as fast
as his heavy limbs would allow  he hastened to the window  it was a
great deal harder to go down the lattice than to climb up it  and twice
he almost lost his footing  but at last he stood safely on the ground 
the window he left open  he had no strength left for extra exertion 

with increasing difficulty he stumbled across the lawn to his old
position beside the gateway of the fort  a sense of duty had sustained
him thus far  for a sentry must be found at his post  but now that he
was there  all power seemed to desert his limbs  little susan s warm
fingers had perhaps put just so much life into him  and no more  as
would enable him to do what he had done  as a clock can run but its
appointed course of hours and must then stop  his head turned no longer
in the direction of the house  his eyes looked immovably forward  the
straight stiff hand held out the broken gun  two o clock sounded from
the church steeple  three  four  the earliest dawn crept slowly into the
sky  it broadened to a soft pink flush  a sudden wind rose and stirred 
and as if quickened by its impulse up came the yellow sun  smoke began
to curl from the house chimneys  doors opened  voices sounded  but still
snowy peter did not move 

 why  what is this   cried nurse freeman  hurrying into the nursery from
her bedroom  which was near   how comes this window to be open  i left
the fire covered up a purpose  that my dears might have a warm room to
breakfast in  it s as cold as a barn  it must be that careless maria 
she s no head and no thoughtfulness  that girl  

maria denied the accusation  but nurse was not convinced   windows did
not open without hands   she justly observed  but what hands opened this
particular window nurse freeman never  never knew 

presently another phenomenon claimed her attention  there on the carpet 
close to the table where the jam pot stood  was a large slop of water 
it marked the spot where the snow man had begun to melt the night
before 

 it s the snow the children brought in on their boots   suggested maria 

 boots   cried nurse freeman incredulously   boots  when i changed them
myself and put on their warm slippers   she shook her head portentously
as she wiped up the slop   there s something _on_accountable in it all  
she said  so there was  but it was a great deal more unaccountable than
nurse freeman suspected 

when the children ran out  after lessons  to play in their fort  their
time for wonderment came  how oddly snowy peter looked   not at all as
he did the day before  his figure had somehow grown rubbed and shabby 
the buttons were gone from his coat tails  the gun they had taken such
pains with was broken in two  _where was the other half _ 

 what s that on his finger   demanded elma   it looks as if it were
bleeding  

it was the juice of the strawberry jam  paul first tasted delicately
with the tip of his tongue  then he boldly bit the finger off and
swallowed it 

 why  what made you do that   asked the others 

 jam   was the succinct reply 

 jam  impossible  how could our snow man get at any jam  it couldn t be
that  

 tastes like it  any way   remarked paul 

 i can t think what has happened to spoil him so   said elma 
plaintively   do you think a loose horse can have got into the yard
during the night  see how the snow is trampled down  

 hallo  look here   shouted reggie   this is the queerest thing yet 
there s the other half the gun sticking out half way up the clematis
frame  

 it must have been a horse   said elma  who having once settled on the
idea found it hard to give it up   it couldn t be anything else  

 oh  yes  it could  it was no horse  it was me   said snowy peter in the
depths of his being  where a little warmth still lingered 

 he s very ugly now  i think  see how he s melted all along his
shoulder  and his hair has got out of curl  and his nose is awful  
pronounced susan sunflower   let s pull him to pieces and make a nicer
man  

 oh  oh   groaned snowy peter  with a final effort of consciousness  his
inward sufferings did not affect his features in the least  and no one
suspected that he was feeling anything  paul knocked the pipe out of his
mouth with a snow ball  harry  with a great push  rolled him over  the
crisp snow parted and flew  the children hurrahed  in three minutes he
was a shapeless mass  and nobody ever knew or guessed how for a few
brief hours he had lived the life of a human being  been agitated by
hope and moved by desire  so ended snowy peter  and his sole mourner was
little susan  who remarked   after all  he _was_ nice before he got
spoiled  and i wish nursey had seen him  




the do something society 


clatter  clatter  went a sewing machine in an upstairs room  as the busy
mamma of the newcombe children bent over it  guiding the long breadths
beneath the clicking needle  her eyes fixed on its glancing point  but
her thoughts very far away  after the fashion of mammas who work on
sewing machines  the slam of a door  and the sound of quick feet in the
entry below  arrested her attention 

 that is catherine  of course   she said to herself   none of the other
children bang the door in just that particular way  

the top of a rapidly ascending red hat  with a pigtail of fair hair
hanging beneath it  became visible  as mrs  newcombe glanced across to
the staircase  it _was_ catherine  another moment  and she burst into
the room 

 mamma  mamma  where are you  oh  mamma  we girls have invented a
society  and we are all going to belong to it  

 who is  all   and what sort of a society is it   demanded mrs 
newcombe  by no means suspending her machine work 

 all  we six  i mean  frances and the vaughns  and the  tittering
twins   and me  we haven t any name for the society yet  but we want to
do something  

 what sort of a something  

 oh  i don t know  all sorts of somethings  but  first of all  you know
how sick minnie banister is  don t you  mamma  

 yes  

 well  the society is really gotten up for her  we want to go every
saturday  and take her presents  surprises  you know  so that she can be
sort of expecting us all the week and looking forward  don t you think
that is a good plan  mamma  

 very good  but what kind of presents were you thinking of  

 i don t know exactly  we haven t thought about that yet  something
pretty  you ll give us some money to buy them with  won t you  mamma  

 no  dear  i can t do that  

 but  mamma  

 listen  catherine  and don t pucker your forehead so  it s a bad habit
which you have taken up lately  and i want you to break yourself of it 
i cannot give you money to buy presents  not that i do not love minnie 
or am not sorry for her  but i cannot afford it  papa has his own boys
and girls to feed and clothe and educate  he cannot spare money for
things that are not necessary  even when they are kind pleasant things
like this plan of yours  

 but  mamma  little bits of things  it wouldn t take much  

 you naturally feel that there is no bottom to papa s pocket  catherine 
that he has only to put his hand in and take out what he likes  but  my
dear  that isn t true  papa cannot do it any more than you can  

 then we can t have our society   cried catherine 

her lip trembled  and her face flushed pink with the sense of
disappointment 

 i didn t say that   said her mother  smiling   have the society by all
means  and carry out your plans  that can be done without money  

 but  mamma  how can it  what do you mean  

 the how i must leave to you  set your wits to work  and you will find
out  there are plenty of ways in which to please sick people besides
buying them things  notice carefully when you are there  ask mrs 
banister  use your eyes  things will suggest themselves  what sick
people enjoy most are little surprises to vary their dull days  and the
sense that some one is loving and thinking about them  small unexpected
pleasures count for more than their worth with them  now  dear  run
away  consult with the others  and when you decide what you want to do 
come to me  and i will do what i can to help you in ways that do not
cost money  

catherine looked more hopeful  though not altogether convinced 

 i ll see what they say   she remarked thoughtfully  then  after
lingering a moment  as if in hopes of something more  she ran downstairs
again 

she found the members of the future society looking rather crestfallen 
they had all rushed home to propound their plan  and each of their
mothers in turn had raised pretty much the same objections to it which
mrs  newcombe had raised  and had not tempered their denials with any
fresh suggestions  catherine s report had  therefore  rather the effect
of raising their spirits 

 i m  not  sure   said frances brooks   but it would be more fun to do
it that way than the other  don t you know how much nicer it always is
to make christmas presents than to buy them  and i thought of something
while you were talking that might do for the first saturday surprise  

 have you really  what  

 it came into my head because the other day when mary and i were there 
minnie lost her handkerchief  it had slipped under the mattress or
somewhere  and she worried about not finding it  and mrs  banister was a
good while in getting another  and i was wondering if it wouldn t be
nice to make some sort of a little case  which could lie on the bed
beside her  and hold it  

 out of birch bark   suggested mary vaughn 

 splendid  we could work little blue forget me nots on it in crewels  
suggested sue hooper 

 yes  and i have a bit of blue silk that would be just the thing for the
lining   put in ethel hooper  the second  tittering twin   sue being the
first   sister had it left over from a sofa pillow  so she gave it to
me  it is quite light  and will match the forget me nots  

 now  isn t that delightful   cried catherine   here s our first
surprise all settled without any trouble at all  i know where we can get
the bark   from one of those big birches in mr  swayne s woods  and
mother ll give us some orris root for a _sachet_  i know  she has some
that s particularly nice  it came from philadelphia  

under these promising auspices the  do something society   for that was
the name resolved upon  came into existence  many hands made light work
of the little handkerchief case  all the members went together to get
the birch bark  which in itself was good fun  mary vaughn cut out the
case  amy  who had taken a set of lessons in kensington stitch  worked
the starry zigzag pattern  which did duty for forget me nots  upon it 
susy hooper  who was the best needlewoman of them all  lined it 
catherine made the _sachet_  ethel  as youngest  was allowed to fasten
it into the case with a tiny blue bow  and they took turns in carrying
it  as they walked toward minnie s house saturday morning 

minnie had been looking forward to saturday all the week  it was the
only day when these special friends had time to come for a good long
stay with her  on other days they  ran in   but what with schools and
music lessons  and daily walks and short winter afternoons  they always
had to run out again long before she was ready to have them go  she had
been watching the clock ever since she woke  in hopes that they would
come early  nor was she disappointed  for by half past ten the bell
rang  and steps and voices were heard coming upstairs  minnie raised
herself  and held out her hands 

 o girls  how lovely  you ve all come together   she said   i ve been
wondering all the week if you would  

 you darling  how nice it is to see you  are you any better to day  
asked catherine 

then  after they had all kissed her  amy laid on the counterpane the
handkerchief case pinned up in thin white paper 

 there s something for you   cried the society  as with one voice 

it took a good while for minnie to open the parcel  for her fingers were
weak  but she would not let any one help her  when the pretty birch bark
case was revealed  she was even more pleased than her friends had hoped
she would be 

 how dear you were to make it for me   she kept repeating   i shall
never lose my handkerchiefs now  and i shall look at it when you are not
here  and it will give me the feeling that you are making me a visit  

then they explained the new society to her and asked her to join  with
the understanding that she was not to be an  active member  till she was
quite well again  and minnie agreed  and became on the spot number seven
of the do somethings  what they did not explain was their plan for the
saturdays  because mrs  newcombe had dropped this word of wisdom into
their counsels  that sick people enjoy a little pleasure which comes
unexpectedly  much more than a larger one which they lie and think about
till they are tired of the idea of it  catherine had to bite her nimble
tongue more than once to hold the secret in  but the eyes of the others
held her in check  and she remembered in time  and while they chattered
and laughed  mary vaughn kept her eyes open as mrs  newcombe had
advised  and with such good effect that  as the society trooped out on
to the sidewalk  she was ready to say   girls  i have thought of
something for next time  

 and so have i   added frances 

 not really  what fun  tell us what yours is  

 a wall basket full of dried leaves and things to fill up that bare
space of wall opposite minnie s bed  it needn t cost anything  for i
have got one of those big japanese cuffs made of straw which will do for
the basket  and there are thousands of leaves to be had for the
picking  

 what a good idea that is   said amy vaughn   we will make it lovely 
and it will be something bright for minnie to look at  we ll do it  but
what was your idea  mary  

 mine was a sand bag  didn t you hear minnie say   mamma  the sheet is
quite wet just where my foot comes   and mrs  banister came in a hurry
and took away the hot water bag  and said there was something wrong with
the screw  and it was always leaking  my aunt  who is an invalid  uses
a bag of sand instead  it is made very hot in the oven and slipped into
a little cover  and it keeps warm longer than hot water does  she says 
don t you think we might make one for minnie  

 it s the best idea yet   said catherine   and we will have it for next
saturday because it s something useful that she really wants  and that
will give us plenty of time to dry the leaves for the saturday after  

the sand bag  with its little slip cover of red canton flannel  proved a
remarkable success  it was the comfort of her life  minnie declared  but
the joy of her life was the wall basket which followed on the next
saturday  and which made a beautiful spot of brightness on the bare
wall  ethel hooper  who had a natural instinct for color and effect 
arranged it  it held branches of deep red and vivid yellow leaves  with
sprays of orange and green sumach  deep russet oak and trails of flaming
blackberry vine  amid which rose a few velvet brown cat tails and fluffy
milk weed pods  supporting in their midst a tiny bird s nest poised in a
leafless twig  minnie was never tired of looking at it  she said it was
as good as taking a walk in the woods to see it  the gay color
refreshed her eyes  and cheered many a dull moment when she was alone
and did not feel like reading  and  altogether  the wall basket proved
one of the most successful of the achievements of the do something
society that winter 

i have not time to tell you of all the many other things they did  one
saturday the gift was a home made sponge cake  another time it was some
particularly nice molasses candy  pulled very white  and braided and
twirled into m s and b s  a pillow stuffed with balsam fir was another
of the presents  on christmas eve they carried her the tiniest little
fir tree ever seen  a mere baby of a fir  planted in a flower pot  hung
with six mandarin oranges  and lighted with wax matches which burned
just long enough to be admired and no longer  later there was a comical
valentine  and on minnie s birthday a pretty card  designed by
catherine  who had a taste for drawing 

one melancholy saturday  when minnie was too ill to see them  the
members all left their cards in a little basket  another time it was the
cards of all their pet cats  and while they thus labored to make the
hard months less hard for their friend  their own souls were growing 
keeping pace with their growing bodies  as souls do which are properly
exercised in deeds of kindliness and unselfish love  so that when spring
came  bringing roses back to minnie s pale cheeks  and strength to her
feeble limbs  and she was able to take her place among the rest and be a
 do something  too  all of them were eager to keep on  and to continue
the work begun for one  by service for the many who needed cheering as
much as minnie had done 

and the best part of the lesson which all of them had learned was  so
mrs  newcombe thought  the great lesson that money  though a useful  is
not an essential  part of true helpfulness  and that time given  and
thought  and observation  and ingenuity  and loving hearts  can
accomplish without it all the best and sweetest part of giving 




who ate the queen s luncheon 


you can imagine the state of excitement into which otillie le breton was
thrown  when  one day in june  her father  the seigneur of sark  came
home and told her that the queen  who was cruising about the channel in
the royal yacht  had notified him of her intention of landing at sark
the next thursday and of lunching at the seigneurie 

it sounds such a fine thing to be the daughter of the seigneur of sark 
that perhaps you will imagine that otillie was used to kings and queens
and fine company of all sorts  and wonder that she should feel so much
excited on this occasion  not at all  the seigneur of sark is only a
quiet  invalid clergyman who owns his little island just as other
english gentlemen do their estates  letting out the land to farmers and
collecting his rents and paying his taxes like other people  and otillie
was a simply brought up girl of fourteen  who knew much less of the
world than most girls of her age in boston or new york  had never been
off the channel islands  and never set eyes on a  crowned head  in her
life  and she felt exactly as any of us would if we were suddenly told
that a queen was coming to take a meal in our father s house 

queens are not common apparitions in any of the channel islands  and
least of all in little sark  it is a difficult place to get to even for
common people  the island  which is only three miles long  is walled by
a line of splendid cliffs over three hundred feet high  its only harbor
is a strip of beach  defended by a tiny breakwater  from which a steep
road is tunnelled up through the rocks to the interior of the island  in
rough weather  when the wind blows and the sea runs high  which is the
case five days out of seven in summer  and six and a half days out of
seven in winter  boats dare not make for this difficult landing  which
is called by the natives  the creux   or hole  it is reported that some
years since when the lords of the admiralty were on a tour of inspection
they sailed all round sark and sailed away again  reporting that no
place could be discovered where it was possible to land  which seemed
to the sarkites a very good joke indeed 

there are four principal islands in the channel group  alderney and
jersey  from which come the cows all of us know about  guernsey  whose
cattle  though not so celebrated on this side of the sea  are held by
the islanders as superior to all others  and sark  the smallest and by
far the most beautiful of the four  it is a real story book island  the
soft  sea climate and the drifting mists of the gulf stream nourish in
its green valleys all manner of growing things  flowers flourish there
as nowhere else  heliotropes grow into great clumps  and red and pink
geraniums into bushes  fuchsias and white starred jessamines climb to
the very roofs of the mossy old farm houses  which stand knee deep  as
it were  in vines and flowers  long links of rose colored bindweed lie
in tangles along the dusty roadside  you tread on them as you walk
through the shady lanes  between hedge rows of ivy and sweet brier and
briony  from whose leaves shine out little glittering beetles  in mail
coats of flashing  iridescent green  like those which the cuban ladies
wear on their lace dresses as a decoration  there is only one wagon
kept for hire on the island  and all is primitive and peaceful and full
of rest and repose 

but there are wonderful things too  as well as beautiful ones   strange
spouting holes in the middle of green fields  where the sea has worn its
way far inland  and  with a roar  sends sudden shocks of surf up through
its chimney like vent  caves too  full of dim green light  in whose
pools marvellous marine creatures flourish  

     the fruitage and bloom of the ocean  

or strange spines of rock path linking one end of the island with the
other by a road not over five feet wide  from whose undefended edges the
sheer precipice goes down on either side for hundreds of feet into the
ocean  there are natural arches in the rocks also through which the
wonderful blue green sea glances and leaps  all about the island the
water is of this remarkable color  like the plumage of a peacock or a
dragonfly s glancing wings  and out of it rise strange rock shapes 
pyramids and obelisks and domes  over which white surf breaks
constantly 

some of the most remarkable of these rocks are beneath the seigneurie 
whose shaven lawns and walled gardens stretch to the cliff top and
command a wide sea view  it is a fine old house  with terraces and stone
balustrades over which vines cluster thickly  and peacocks sit 
spreading their many eyed tails to the sun  as if trying to outdo the
strange  flashing  iridescent sea 

otillie herself always fed these peacocks  which were old family
friends  there were six of them  bluet and cramoisie   the parents of
the flock  who had been named by mrs  le breton  who was a
frenchwoman   peri and fee de fees  and lorenzo the magnificent and the
great panjandrum  these last christened by otillie herself on account of
their size and stately demeanor  the beautiful creatures were quite
tame  they would take food from her hand  and if she failed to present
herself at the accustomed time with her bowl of millet and bread  they
would put their heads in at the terrace windows and scream  till she
recollected her duty and came to them 

i am afraid that the peacocks were rather neglected for the few days
preceding the queen s visit  for everybody at the seigneurie was very
busy  mr  le breton  as a general thing  lived simply enough  his wife
had died when otillie was only six years old  miss niffin the governess 
marie the cook  two housemaids  and an old butler who had served the
family for a quarter of a century made up the establishment indoors 
otillie had her basin of porridge and cream and her slice of bread at
eight o clock every morning  and bread and milk and  kettle tea  for
supper  with now and then a taste of jam by way of a treat  the servants
lived chiefly on  jersey soup   a thick broth of oatmeal  vegetables 
and fish  with a trifle of bacon or salt beef to give it a relish  mr 
le breton had his morning coffee in his study  and the early dinner 
which he shared with otillie and miss niffin  was not an elaborate one 

these being the customs of the seigneurie  it can easily be imagined
that it taxed every resource of the establishment to provide suitably
for the queen s entertainment  all the island knew of the important
event and longed to advise and help  the farmers sent their thickest
cream and freshest strawberries and lettuces  desirous to prove their
loyalty not to their sovereign only  but also to their landlord  marie 
the cook  spent the days in reading over her most difficult recipes 
and could not sleep at night  a friend of hers  once second cook to the
earl of dunraven  but now retired on her laurels into private life 
offered to come for a few days to assist  and to fabricate a certain
famous game pasty  of which it was asserted the english aristocracy are
inordinately fond  peter the butler crossed over to guernsey twice
during the week with a long list of indispensables to be filled up at
the shops there  hampers of wine came from london  and hot house grapes
and nectarines from friends in jersey  the whole house was in a bustle 
and nothing was spoken of but the queen and the queen s visit  what she
would wear and say and do  whom she would bring with her  and what sort
of weather she would have for her coming 

this last point was the one on which otillie was most solicitous  a true
child of sark  she knew all about its tides and currents  the dangers of
the island channels  and the differences which a little more or less
wind and sea made in the navigation of them  she could recollect one
stormy winter  when a guernsey doctor who had come over to set a broken
arm was detained for three weeks on the island  in plain sight all the
time of his own home in st  peterport  but as unable to get to it as if
it had been a thousand miles away 

 it would be dreadful if the queen came and then could not get away
again for three weeks   she said to herself   it would be awfully
interesting to have her here  of course  but i don t quite know what we
should do  or what she would do   she tried to make a picture of it in
her mind  but soon gave up the attempt  provisions are scarce sometimes
on sark when the wind blows and the boats cannot get in  there would
always be milk and vegetables and fruit if it were summer  and perhaps
chickens enough could be collected to hold out  but there was something
terrible in the idea of a queen without butcher s meat  otillie s
imagination refused to compass it 

her very first thought when the important day dawned was the weather 

she waked with the first sunbeam and ran at once to the window  when she
saw a clear sky and the sun rising out of a still sea  she gave a scream
of delight 

 what is the matter   asked miss niffin sleepily from the next room 

 it s good weather   replied otillie   we ve got the most beautiful day
for the queen to come in  

miss niffin s only answer was a little groan  she was a small  shy
person  and the idea of confronting royalty made her dreadfully nervous 
 oh  if the day were only over   she said to herself  and she longed to
plead a headache and stay in bed  but she dared not  besides  she felt
that it would be cowardly to desert her post on such an important
occasion and leave otillie alone  so she braced her mind to face the
awful necessity and began to dress 

mr  le breton  awakening about the same time  gave a groan a good deal
like miss niffin s  he was a loyal subject  and felt the honor that was
done him by the queen s inviting herself to luncheon  but  all the same 
invalids do not like to be put out of their way  and he  too  wished the
day well done 

 ten to one i shall be laid up for the next month to pay for it   he
reflected  then he too braced himself to the necessity and rang for hot
water  determined to do his duty as a man and a seigneur 

otillie was perhaps the only person in the house who was really glad to
have the day come  the servants were tired and fretted with a sense of
responsibility  marie had passed a dreadful night  full of dreams of
failure and spoiled dishes 

 now just as sure as guns my rolls will have failed to rise this day of
all the days of the year   was her first waking thought  but no  the
rolls were light as a feather  and the sponge and almond cakes came out
of the oven delicately browned and quite perfect in taste and
appearance  nothing went wrong  and when mr  le breton  just before
starting for the creux harbor to meet the royal party  took a look into
the dining room to make sure that all was right  he said to himself that
he had never seen a prettier or more complete little  spread  

the table was ornamented with hot house fruit and flowers  beautifully
arranged by miss niffin and otillie  all the fine old le breton plate
had been brought out and polished  the napery shone like iced snow 
there were some quaint pieces of old venetian glass  jugs  dishes  and
flagons  and a profusion of pretty confections  jellies  blanc manges 
crystallized fruits  and bonbons  to give sparkle and color  the light
streamed in at the windows which opened on the terrace  from under the
vines the flash of the waves could be seen  the curtains waved in the
wind  which was blowing inland  nothing could be prettier  the only
discord was the noisy scream of the peacocks on the lawn  who seemed as
much upset and disturbed by the great event as the rest of the
household 

 can t something be done to stop those creatures   said mr  le breton 
 tie them up somewhere  can t you  otillie  or send a boy to drive them
down to the farm  

 it s only because they are hungry   replied otillie rather absently   i
haven t given them their breakfast yet  

she was sticking long stems of fronded osmundas into a jar as a
decoration for the fireplace  and scarcely noticed what her father said 
it was some minutes after the carriage drove away before she finished 
then  with a sigh of relief  she brushed up the leaves she had scattered
on the carpet  and ran upstairs to change her dress  it would never do
to be caught by the queen in a holland frock  with her hair blown about
her eyes  and green finger tips 

the clock struck one as she fastened her white dress and patted smooth
the bows of her wide pink sash  one was the hour fixed for the queen to
land  so there was no time to lose  otillie only waited for a glance in
at the door of the spare room  where the queen  if so minded  was to
take off her things  she glanced at the bed with a sort of awe as the
possible repository of a royal bonnet  altered the position of a bowl of
roses on the mantelpiece  and then hurried down to join miss niffin 
who  attired in her best black silk and a pair of lace mitts  was seated
decorously in the hall doing nothing  otillie sat down beside her  it
was rather a nervous waiting  and a long one  for half an hour passed 
three quarters  and finally the clock struck two  before wheels were
heard on the gravel  and during all that time the two watchers spoke
scarcely a word  only once otillie cried as a gust of wind blew the
curtains straight out into the room   o dear  i hope it isn t rough  o
dear  wouldn t it be dreadful if the queen were to be sick  she would
never like sark again  

 i think her majesty must be used to the sea  she sails so much  
replied miss niffin  the gust died away and did not blow the curtains
any more  and again they sat in silence  waiting and listening 

 at last   cried otillie as the distinct roll of wheels was heard on
the drive  her heart beat fast  but she got up bravely  straightened her
slender little figure as became a le breton  and walked out on to the
porch  her eyes seemed strangely dazzled by the sun  for she could see
no one in the carriage but her father 

it rolled up to the door  and otillie felt a great throb of
disappointment rise like a wave in her heart  and spread and swell  mr 
le breton had come back alone 

 papa   she cried  as soon as she could speak   what _has_ happened 
where is the queen  

 i hope nothing has gone amiss with her gracious majesty   put in miss
niffin from behind 

mr  le breton got out of the carriage before he replied  he looked tired
and annoyed 

 you can drive to the stable  thomas   he said   the carriage will not
be wanted   then he turned to miss niffin 

 her gracious majesty has decided not to land   he went on   the wind
has sprung up and made rather a sea outside the breakwater  nothing to
signify by the sark standard  but enough to deter inexperienced persons 
i waited at the creux for nearly an hour  and every man  woman  and
child on the island waited with me  with the exception of you and
otillie and the servants  and then the captain of the royal yacht
signalled that he could not risk putting the queen ashore in a small
boat in such rough water  so the thing is given up  

there was a certain latent relief in mr  le breton s tone 

 oh   cried otillie  stamping her foot   how hateful of the wind to
spring up  it could have waited as well as not  it has all the rest of
the time to blow in  and now all the nice preparations are thrown away 
and all our pleasant time spoiled  and just as likely as not the queen
will never come to sark at all   her voice died away into a storm of
sobs 

 i wish i could be assured of that   remarked her father in a tone of
weary resignation   what i am afraid of is that she will come  or try to
come  another day  and then there will be all this to do over again  

he indicated by a gesture the door of the dining room  from which queer
muffled sounds were heard just then 

 peter seems as much afflicted by this disappointment as you are 
otillie   he added   come  my child  don t cry over the matter  it can t
be helped  wind and waves oblige nobody  not even kings and queens  

 there are compensations for all our troubles   said miss niffin in her
primmest tone   we must bear up  and try to feel that all is for the
best   miss niffin seemed to find it quite easy to be morally consoled
for her share of loss in the giving up of the queen s visit 

 how can you talk in that way   cried otillie  who was not in the least
in awe of miss niffin   if i had broken my comb  you would have said
exactly the same  i know you would  there isn t any compensation at all
for this trouble  and it s no use my trying to feel that it s for the
best   it isn t  

 we never know   replied miss niffin piously 

 come   said mr  le breton  desiring to put an end to the altercation 
 i don t know why we should go hungry because her majesty won t come and
eat our luncheon  take my arm  miss niffin  and let us have something to
eat  marie will break her heart if all her trouble and pains are not
appreciated by somebody  

 illustration  the peacocks  tired of waiting for their morning meal 
and finding the windows open  had entered and helped themselves   _page
107 _ 

he gave his arm to miss niffin as he spoke  and moved forward to the
dining room  otillie followed  wiping her eyes with her handkerchief 
and feeling that the dainties would stick in her throat if she tried to
swallow them  she was so very  very  dreadfully disappointed 

but when mr  le breton reached the dining room door he stopped suddenly
as if shot  and gave a sort of shout  no one could speak for a moment 
there was the feast  so prettily and tastefully arranged only an hour
before  a mass of ruins  the flowers were upset  the fruit  tumbled and
mashed  stained the cloth and the floor  wine and lemonade dripped from
the table s edge  the pink and yellow jellies  the forms of charlotte
russe and blanc mange and the frosted cakes and tarts were reduced to
smears and crumbs  where the gigantic pasty had stood remained only an
empty dish  and above the remains  rearing  pecking  clawing  gobbling 
appeared six long blue green necks  which dipped and rose and dipped
again 

the peacocks  tired of waiting for their morning meal  and finding the
windows open  had entered and helped themselves  there was lorenzo the
magnificent with a sponge cake in his beak  and peri gobbling down a
lump of blanc mange  and the grand panjandrum with both claws embedded
in a pyramid of macaroons  their splendid tails were draggled with cream
and crumbs  and sticky with jelly  altogether they presented a most
greedy and disreputable appearance  the strangest part of the whole was
that while they stuffed themselves they preserved a dead silence  and
did not express their enjoyment by one of their usual noisy screams  it
was evident that they felt that the one great opportunity of their lives
was going on  and that they must make the most of it 

at the sound of mr  le breton s shout the peacocks started guiltily 
then they gathered up their tails as best they might  and  half flying 
half running  scuttled out of the windows and far across the lawn 
screaming triumphantly as they went  while otillie tumbled into a chair
and laughed till she cried 

 oh  didn t they look funny   she gasped  holding her sides 

 rather expensive fun   replied the seigneur ruefully   but it is one
comfort that we have it to ourselves   then the humor of the situation
seized on him also  and he sat down and laughed almost as hard as
otillie 

 dear me  what a mercy that her majesty didn t come   remarked miss
niffin in an awe struck tone 

 good gracious   cried otillie with sudden horror at the thought 
 suppose she had  suppose we had all walked in at that door and found
the peacocks here  and of course we should  of course they would have
done it just the same if there had been fifty queens to see them  how
dreadful it would have been  oh  there are compensations  miss niffin  i
see it now  

so otillie was reconciled to her great disappointment  though the queen
never has tried to land at sark again  and perhaps never will  for  as
otillie sensibly says   it is a great deal better that we should be
disappointed than that the queen should be  for if she had been very
hungry  and most likely she would have been after sailing and all  she
would not have thought the grand panjandrum with his feet in the
macaroons half so funny as we did  and would have been truly and really
vexed  

so it was all for the best  as miss niffin said 




the shipwrecked cologne bottle 


it seemed the middle of the night  though it was really only three
o clock in the morning  when little davy crocker was wakened by a sudden
stamping of feet on the stoop below his window  and by a voice calling
out that a ship was ashore off the point  and that captain si  davy s
uncle  must turn out and help with the life boat 

davy was a  landlubber   as his cousin sam coffin was wont to assert
whenever he wanted to tease him  he had lived all his short life at
townsend harbor  up among the new hampshire hills  and until this visit
to his aunt at nantucket  had never seen the sea  all the more the sea
had for him a great interest and fascination  as it has for everybody to
whom it has not from long familiarity become a matter of course 

conversation in nantucket is apt to possess a nautical and  so to speak 
salty flavor  davy  since his arrival  had heard so much about ships
which had foundered  or gone to pieces on rocks  or burned up  or sprung
leaks and had to be pumped out  that his mind was full of images of
disaster  and he quite longed to realize some of them  to see a
shipwreck had become his great ambition  he was not particular as to
whether the ship should burn or founder or go ashore  any of these would
do  only he wanted all the sailors to be saved 

once he had gone with his cousins to the south shore on the little
puffing railroad which connects nantucket town with siasconsett  and of
which all the people of the island are so justly proud  and there on the
beach  amid the surf rollers which look so soft and white and are so
cruelly strong  he had seen a great piece of a ship  nearly the whole of
the bow end it appeared to be  it was much higher than davy s head  and
seemed to him immense and formidable  yet this enormous thing the sea
had taken into its grasp and tossed to and fro like a plaything and at
last flung upon the sand as if it were a toy of which it had grown
weary  it gave davy an idea of the great power of the water  and it was
after seeing this that he began to long to witness a shipwreck  and now
there was one  and the very sound of the word was enough to make him rub
open his sleepy eyes and jump out of bed in a hurry 

but when he had groped his way to the window and pulled up the rattling
paper shade  behold  there was nothing to be seen  the morning was
intensely dark  a wild wind was blowing great dashes of rain on the
glass  and the house shook and trembled as the blasts struck it 

davy heard his uncle on the stairs  and hurried to the door   mayn t i
go to the shipwreck with you  uncle si   he called out 

 go to what  go back to bed  my boy  that s the place for you  there ll
be shipwreck enough in the morning to satisfy all of us  i reckon  

davy dared not disobey  he stumbled back to bed  making up his mind to
lie awake and listen to the wind till it was light  and then go to see
the shipwreck  anyhow   but it is hard to keep such resolutions when you
are only ten years old  the next thing he knew he was rousing in
amazement to find the room full of brilliant sunlight  the rain was
over  though the wind still thundered furiously  and through the noise
it made  the sea could be heard thundering louder still 

davy jumped out of bed  dressed as fast as he could  and hurried
downstairs  the house seemed strangely empty  aunt patty was not in the
kitchen  nor was cousin myra in the pantry skimming milk  as was usual
at this hour of the day  davy searched for them in woodshed  garden  and
barn  at last he spied them on the  walk  at the top of the house  and
ran upstairs to join them 

do any of you know what a  walk  is  i suppose not  unless you have
happened to live in a whaling town  many houses in nantucket have them 
they are railed platforms  built on the peak of the roof between the
chimneys  and are used as observatories from which to watch what is
going on at sea  there the wives and sweethearts of the whalers used to
go in the old days  and stand and sweep the ocean with spy glasses  in
hopes of seeing the ships coming in from their long cruises each with
the signals set which told if the voyage had been lucky or no  and how
many barrels of oil and blubber she was bringing home  then they used to
watch the  camels   great hulls used as floats to lighten the vessels 
go out and help the heavy laden ship over the bar  and when that was
done and every rope and spar conned and studied by the experienced eyes
on the roofs  it was time to hurry down  hang on the welcoming pot  trim
the fire and don the best gown  so as to make a bright home coming for
the long absent husband or son 

aunt patty had a spy glass at her eyes when davy gained the roof  she
was looking at the wrecked ship  which was plainly in view  beyond the
little sandy down which separated the house from the sea  there she lay 
a poor broken thing  stuck fast on one of the long reaches of sandy
shoal which stretch about the island and make the navigation of its
narrow and uncertain channels so difficult and sometimes so dangerous 
the heavy seas dashed over the half sunken vessel every minute  between
her and the shore two lifeboats were coming in under closely reefed
sails 

 oh  do let me look through the glass   urged davy  when he was
permitted to do so he uttered an exclamation of surprise  so wonderfully
near did it make everything seem to be 

 why  i can see their faces   he cried   there s uncle si  there s sam 
and there s a very wet man  i guess he s one of the shipwrecked sailors 
hurrah   and davy capered up and down 

 you unfeeling boy   cried myra   give me the glass  you ll let it fall 
he s right  mother  father and sam are coming ashore as fast as they can
sail  and they ll be wanting their breakfasts  of course  i d better go
down and mix the corn bread   she took one more look through the glass 
announced that the other boat had some more of the shipwrecked men on
board  she guessed  and that abner folger was steering  then she ran
down the ladder  followed by her mother  and davy was left to watch the
boats in 

when he too went down  the kitchen was full of good smells of boiling
coffee and frying eggs  and his uncle and sam and the  very wet man 
were just entering the door together  the wet man  it appeared  was the
captain of the wrecked vessel  the rest of the crew had been taken home
by other people 

the captain was a long  brown  sinewy maine man  he was soaked with
sea water and looked haggard and worn  as a man well might who had just
spent such a terrible night  but he had kind  melancholy eyes  and a
nice face  davy thought  the first thing to be done was to get him into
dry clothes  and uncle si carried him up to davy s room for this
purpose  davy followed them  he felt as if he could never see enough of
this  his first shipwrecked sailor 

when the captain had been made comfortable in uncle silas s flannel
shirt and spare pea jacket and a pair of sam s trousers  he hung his own
clothes up to dry  and they all went down to breakfast  aunt patty had
done her best  she was very sorry for the poor man who had lost his
ship  and she even brought out a tumbler of her best grape jelly by way
of a further treat  but the captain  though he ate ravenously  as was
natural to a man who had fasted so long  did not seem to notice what he
was eating  and thus disappointed kind aunt patty  she comforted herself
by thinking what she could get for dinner which he would like  uncle si
and sam were almost as hungry as the maine captain  so not much was said
till breakfast was over  and then they all jumped up and hurried out 
for there was a deal to be done 

davy felt very dull after they had gone  he had never heard of such a
thing as  reaction   but that was what he was suffering from  the
excitement of the morning had died out like a fire which has no more
fuel to feed it  and he could not think of anything that he wanted to
do  he hung listlessly round  watching aunt patty s brisk operations
about the kitchen  and at last he thought he would go upstairs and see
if the captain s clothes were beginning to dry  wet as they were  they
seemed on the whole the most interesting things in the house 

the clothes were not nearly dry  but on the floor  just below where the
rough pea jacket hung  lay a little shining object  it attracted davy s
attention  and he stooped and picked it up 

it was a tiny bottle full of some sort of perfume  and set in a socket
of plated filagree shaped like a caster  with a filagree handle  the
bottle had a piece of white kid tied over its cork with a bit of blue
ribbon  it was not a thing to tempt a boy s fancy  but davy saw that it
was pretty  and the idea came into his head that he should like to carry
it home  to his little sister bella  bella was fond of perfumes  and
the bottle had cologne in it  as davy could smell without taking out the
cork  he was sure that bella would like it 

davy had been brought up to be honest  i am sure that he did not mean to
steal the cologne bottle  the idea of stealing never entered his mind 
and it would have shocked him had it done so  he was an imaginative
little fellow  and the tiny waif seemed to him like a shell or a pebble 
something coming out of the sea  which any one was at liberty to pick up
and keep  he did not say to himself that it probably belonged to the
captain  who might have a value for it  he did not think about the
captain at all  he only thought of bella  so after looking at the pretty
toy for a while  he put it carefully away in the drawer where he kept
his things  pushing it far back  and drawing a pair of stockings in
front of it  so that it might be hidden  he did not want anybody to
meddle with the bottle  it was his now  or rather it was bella s  then
he went up to the walk once more  and was so interested in watching the
wreck and the boats  which  as the wind moderated  came and went between
her and the shore  picking up the barrels and casks which were floated
out of her hold  that he soon forgot all about the matter 

it was nearly dark before the two captains and sam came back to eat the
meal which had been ready for them since the middle of the afternoon 
aunt patty had taken off her pots and saucepans more than once and put
them on again  to suit the long delay  but nothing was spoiled and
everything tasted good  which showed how cleverly she had managed  the
maine captain  whose name it appeared was joy  seemed more cheerful than
in the morning  and more inclined to talk  but after supper  when he had
gone upstairs and put on his own clothes  which aunt patty had kept
before the fire nearly all day and had pressed with hot irons so that
they looked almost as good as ever  his melancholy seemed to come on
again  he sat and puffed at his pipe till aunt patty began to ask
questions about the wreck  captain joy  it appeared  was part owner of
the ship  whose name was the  sarah jane  

 she was called after my wife s sister   he told them   and my little
girl to home has the same name   sarah jane   she is about the age of
that boy there  or a mite older maybe    nodding toward davy   she
wanted to come with me this vy age  but her mother wouldn t hear of it 
and i m mighty thankful she wouldn t  as things have turned out  no
child could have stood the exposure of such a night as we had and come
out alive  and sarah jane  though she s as spry as a cricket and always
on the go  isn t over strong  

the captain took a long pull at his pipe and looked dreamily into the
fire 

 i asked her  just as i was coming off  what i should bring her   he
went on   and she had a wish all fixed and ready  i never knew such a
child for knowing her own mind  she s always sure what she wants  sarah
jane is  the thing she wanted was a cologne bottle  she said  and it
must be just so  shaped like one of them pepper and vinegar what d  you
call em s  that they put on hotel tables  she was very pertikeler about
the kind  she drew me a picter of it on her slate  so  s to have no
mistake  and i promised her if new york could furnish it she should have
that identical article  and she was mighty pleased  

nobody noticed that at the mention of the cologne bottle  davy gave a
guilty jump  and shrank back into the shadow of uncle si s broad
shoulders  oh  if he could only put it back into the pocket of the
pea jacket  but how could he when the captain had the jacket on 

 i was kind of fearful that there wouldn t be any bottles of that
pertikeler shape that sarah jane had in her mind   continued captain
joy   but the town seemed to be chock full of  em  the very first shop i
come to  there they stood in the window  rows of  em  and i just went in
and bought one for sarah jane before i did anything else  and when i d
got it safely stowed away in the locker  i felt kind of easy in my mind 
we come down with a load of coal  but i hadn t more  n a quarter cargo
to take back  mostly groceries for the stores up to bucksport and
ellsworth   and it s lucky it was no more  as things have happened  the
schooner was pretty old and being so light in ballast  i jedged it
safest  when the blow come on so hard from the nor  east  to run it
under the lee of cape cod and ride it out there if we could  but we
hadn t been anchored more  n three hours  just about nine o clock it
was  when the men came to tell me that we was taking in water terrible
fast  i suppose the ship had kind of strained her seams open in the
gale  it want no use trying to pump her out in such a storm  and if we
didn t want to go down at our anchorage  there wasn t anything for it
but to cut her loose and drive across the haven in hopes of going
aground on the sand before she sank  i can tell you if ever a man
prayed  i prayed then  when i thought every minute she d founder in deep
water before we struck the shoal  and just as she was settling i heard
the sand grate under the keel  and you may believe i was thankful 
though it meant the loss of pretty much all i ve got in the world  i
shouted to the men to get to the rigging in the mainmast  for i knew
she d go to pieces pretty soon  and there wasn t no way of signalling
for help till daylight  and i gave one dive for the cabin  got the
papers out of the locker  and sarah jane s cologne bottle  buttoned them
up inside my pea coat  and just got back again in time to see the
foremast go over the side and the sea make a clean sweep of the decks 
the mainmast stayed  and we lashed ourselves  and managed to hold on
till sunrise  when we see you a coming out to us  and glad we were 

 every now and then in the night  when the water was washing over us  i
put my fingers inside my coat and made sure that sarah jane s bottle was
there  and wasn t broken  i didn t want the child to be disappointed 
you see  it was safe when we come ashore  i m certain of that  but   
the captain paused 

 now don t say it got broken after all   cried myra sympathetically 

 no  it wasn t broken  but it s just as bad   said captain joy   either
i dropped it getting out of the boat and trod it down in the sand  or
else some one has took it  it s gone  any way  and do you know  it s a
foolish thing to say  but i feel nigh as bad about that there little dud
as wasn t worth more  n fifty cents  as i do about the loss of the hull
cargo  on account of sarah jane  

there was a pause as he ceased  aunt patty and myra were too sorry for
the captain to feel like speaking at once  suddenly into the silence
there fell the sound of a sob  everybody started  and uncle si caught
davy s arm and pulled him into the firelight where his face could be
seen 

 why  what are you crying for  little  un   asked uncle si 

 i m so sorry  i didn t know it was the captain s   said davy  in a
tear choked voice 

 didn t know what was the captain s  now  davy crocker   twasn t ever
you who took that bottle   cried aunt patty 

 i found it on the floor   sobbed davy   i thought it was washed ashore
from the shipwreck  i didn t suppose it belonged to anybody  and i
wanted it for bella  oh  i m so sorry  

 why  then it ain t lost after all   cried captain joy  brightening up 
 well  how pleased sarah jane _will_ be  don t cry any more  my lad  i
can see how it was  and that you didn t think it was stealing to take
anything that had been in the sea  

aunt patty and myra  however  still were deeply shocked  and could not
look as lightly at davy s offence as did the captain  davy crept
upstairs  brought down the cologne bottle and slid it into captain joy s
hand  then he crept away and sat in a dark corner behind the rest  but
his conscience followed him  and myra s reproachful look 

 oh  davy   she whispered   i never thought you d be so mean as to take
anything from a shipwrecked sailor  

this was davy s punishment  and rankled in his mind long after everybody
else had forgotten the matter  after the sands had swallowed up all that
was left of the  sarah jane   and after the captain had returned to
bucksport and made the real sarah jane happy by the gift of the bottle
she had wished for so much  it rankles occasionally to this day  though
he is now a stout lad of fifteen  that he  he of all boys  should have
done such a thing to a man just saved from the sea  he consoles himself
by resolving to be particularly kind to shipwrecked sailors all the rest
of his life  but unluckily  the  sarah jane  is  so far  his sole
experience of a wreck  and the only sailor he has as yet had any chance
to do anything for is captain joy  and what he did for him we all know 
one does not always have the opportunity to make up for a blunder or a
fault  and i am afraid davy may live his life out and never again have
the good luck to show his good intentions by _not_ picking up and hiding
a shipwrecked cologne bottle 




under a syringa bush 


the old syringa at the foot of the wade s lawn was rather a tree than a
bush  many years of growth had gone to the thickening of its interlaced
boughs  which grew close to the ground  and made an impervious covert 
except on the west side  where a hollow recess existed  into which a
small person  boy or girl  might squeeze and be quite hidden 

sundry other small persons with wings and feathers had discovered the
advantages of the syringa  all manner of unsuspected housekeepings went
on within its fastnesses  from the lark s nest  in a tuft of grass at
the foot of the main stem  to the robin s home on the topmost bough 
solicitous little mothers brooded unseen over minute families  while the
highly decorative bird papa sat on a neighboring hedge  carrying out his
mission  which seemed to be to distract attention from the secreted
family by the sweetness of his song and the beauty of his plumage  in
the dusk of the evening  soft thrills and twitters sounded from the
bush  like whispered conversation  and very entertaining it must have
been  no doubt  to any one who understood the language  so  altogether 
the old syringa bush was an interesting little world of itself 

elly wade found it so  as she sat in the green hiding place on the west
side  crying as if her heart would break  the syringa recess had been
her favorite  secret  ever since she discovered it  nearly two years
before  no one else knew about it  there she went when she felt unhappy
or was having a mood  once the boughs had closed in behind her  no one
could suspect that she was there   a fact which gave her infinite
pleasure  for she was a child who loved privacies and mysteries 

what are moods  does any one exactly understand them  some people
attribute them to original sin  others to nerves or indigestion  but i
am not sure that either explanation is right  they sweep across the
gladness of our lives as clouds across the sun  and seem to take the
color out of everything  grown people learn to conceal  if not to
conquer  their moods  but children cannot do this  elly wade least of
all 

as i said  this was by no means her first visit to the syringa bush  it
has witnessed some stormy moments in her life  when she sat there hot
and grieved  and in her heart believing everybody cruel or unjust  ralph
had teased her  or cora  who was older than she  had put on airs  or
little kitty had been troublesome  or some schoolmate  hateful   she
even accused her mother of unkindness at these times  though she loved
her dearly all the while 

 she thinks the rest are always right  and i wrong   she would say to
herself   oh  well  she ll be sorry some day   what was to make mrs 
wade sorry elly did not specify  but i think it was to be when she 
herself  was found dead  somewhere on the premises  of a broken heart 
elly was very fond of depicting this broken heart and tragical
ending   imaginative children often are  all the same  if she felt ill 
or cut her finger  she ran to mamma for help  and was as much frightened
as if she had not been thinking these deadly thoughts only a little
while before 

to day elly had fled to the syringa bush with no idea of ever coming out
again  a great wrong had been done her  cora was going with a
yachting party  and she was not  mamma had said she was too young to be
trusted  and must wait till she was older and steadier 

 it is cruel   she said with a fresh burst of sobs  as she recalled the
bitter moment when she heard the verdict   it was just as unkind as
could be for her to say that  cora is only four years the oldest  and i
can do lots of things that she can t  she doesn t know a bit about
crocheting  she just knits  and she never made sponge cake  and i have 
and when she rows  she pulls the hardest with her left hand  and makes
the boat wabble  i ve a much better stroke than she has  papa said so 
and i can swim just as well as she can 

 nobody loves me   was her next reflection    nobody at all  they all
hate me  i don t suppose anybody would care a bit if i _did_ die  

but this thought was too hard to be borne 

 yes  they would   she went on   they d feel remorse if i died  and they
ought to  then they would recollect all the mean things they ve done to
me  and they would groan  and say   too late  too late   like the bad
people in story books  

comforted by this idea  she resolved on a plan of action 

 i ll just stay here forever  and not come out at all  of course  i
shall starve to death  then  all summer long they ll be hunting  and
wondering and wondering what has become of me  and when the autumn
comes  and the leaves fall off  they ll know  and they ll say   poor
elly  how we wish we d treated her better   

she settled herself into a more comfortable position   it isn t
necessary to have cramps  you know  even if you _are_ starving to
death   and went on with her reflections  so still was she that the
birds forgot her presence  and continued their twittering gossip and
their small domestic arrangements undisturbed  the lark talked to her
young ones with no fear of being overheard  the robins flew in and out
with worms  the thrush  who occupied what might be called the second
story of the syringa  disciplined a refractory fledgling  and papa
thrush joined in with a series of musical expostulations  elly found
their affairs so interesting that for a moment she forgot her
own   which was good for her 

a big bumble bee came sailing through the air like a wind blown drum 
and stopped for a minute to sip at a syringa blossom  next a soft whir
drew elly s attention  and a shape in green and gold and ruby red
glanced across her vision like a flying jewel  it was a
humming bird   the first of the season  elly had never been so near one
before  nor had so long a chance to look  and she watched with delight
as the pretty creature darted to and fro  dipping its needle like bill
into one flower cup after another  in search of the honey drop which
each contained  she held her breath  not to startle it  but its fine
senses seemed to perceive her presence in some mysterious fashion  and
presently it flew away 

elly s mind  no longer diverted  went back to its unhappiness 

 i wonder how long it is since i came here   she thought   it seems like
a great while  i guess it must be as much as three hours  they re all
through dinner now  and beginning to wonder where i am  but they won t
find me  i can tell them  

she set her lips firmly  and again shifted her position  at the slight
rustle every bird in the bush became silent 

 they needn t   she said to herself   i wouldn t hurt them  i m not like
ralph  he s real bad to birds sometimes  once he took some eggs out of a
dear  cunning  little song sparrow s nest  and blew the yolks  i d never
do such a mean thing as that  

but though she tried to lash herself up to her old sharpness of feeling 
the interruption of wrathful thoughts had somewhat soothed her mood 
still  she held firmly to her purpose  while an increasing drowsiness
crept over her 

 i shall stay here all night   she thought   and all to morrow  and
to morrow night  and then   a yawn   pretty soon i shall be dead  i
suppose  and they ll be  sorry   another yawn   and   

elly was asleep 

when she woke  the bright noon sunshine had given place to a dusky
light  which made the syringa recess very dark  the robins had
discovered her whereabouts  and  hopping nearer and nearer  had perched
upon a branch close to her feet  and were talking about her  she was
dimly conscious of their voices  but had no idea what they were saying 

 why did it come here  any way   asked mrs  robin   a great heavy thing
like that in _our_ bush  

 i don t know  i m sure   replied mr  robin   it makes a strange noise 
but it keeps its eyes shut while it makes it  

 these great creatures are so queer   pursued mrs  robin   there   it s
beginning to move  i wish it would go away  i don t like its being so
near the children  they might see it and be frightened  

the two birds flitted hastily off as elly stretched herself and rubbed
her eyes 

a very uncomfortable gnawing sensation began to make itself evident  it
wasn t exactly pain  but elly felt that it might easily become so  she
remembered now that she fled away from the table  leaving her breakfast
only half finished  yesterday morning   was it yesterday  or was it the
day before that  it felt like a long while ago 

the sensation increased 

 dear me   thought elly   the story books never said that starving to
death felt so  i don t like it a bit  

bravely she fought against the discomfort  but it gained upon her 

she began to meditate whether her family had perhaps not been
sufficiently punished 

 i ve been away a whole day   she reflected   and a whole night  and i
guess they ve felt badly enough  very likely they ve all sat up waiting
for me to come back  they ll be sorry they acted so  and  any way  i m
so dreadfully hungry that i must have something to eat  and i want to
see mamma too  perhaps she ll have repented  and will say   poor elly 
she _may_ go   

in short  elly was seized with a sudden desire for home  and  always
rapid in decision  she lost no time in wriggling herself out of the
bush 

 there  it s gone   chirped the female robin   i m glad of it  i hope it
will never come back  

very cautiously elly crept through the shrubbery on to the lawn  it
still seemed dark  but she now perceived that the gloom came from a
great thunder cloud which was gathering overhead  she could not see the
sun  and  confused with her long sleep  was not able to make out what
part of the day it was  but  somehow  she felt that it was not the early
morning as in the bush she had supposed 

across the lawn she stole  and upon the piazza  no one was visible  the
open window showed the dining table set for something   was it tea 
upstairs she crept  and  looking in at the door as she went by  she saw
her mother in her room taking off her bonnet 

 my poor child  where did you think we had gone   she called out   papa
was kept in town till the second train  and that was late  so we have
only just got back  you must be half starved  waiting so long for your
dinner  i hope nurse gave you some bread and milk  

 why   what day is it   stammered the amazed elly 

 day  why  elly  have you been asleep  it s to day  of
course   thursday  what did you think it was  

elly rubbed her eyes  bewildered  had the time which seemed to her so
long really been so short  had no one missed her  it was her first
lesson in the comparative unimportance of the individual  a sense of
her own foolishness seized her  mamma looked so sweet and kind  why had
she imagined her cruel 

 did you go to sleep  dear   repeated mrs  wade 

 yes  mamma   replied elly  humbly   i did  but i m waked up now  




two girls  two parties 


a great bustle and confusion had reigned the whole week long in the old
house at the top of the hilly street  known to the neighborhood as  the
squire s   all the slip covers had been taken from the furniture in the
best parlor  all the company china had been lifted off its top shelf and
washed  all the spare lamps had been filled  all the rooms swept and
dusted  all the drawers in the bureaus freshly arranged  for  as milly
said to herself   who knew but some one might take a fancy to peep in  

milly grace  the squire s daughter  had sat for hours in a cold woodshed
tying up wreaths of ground pine and hemlock with fingers which grew more
chilly every hour  these wreaths now ornamented the parlor  festooning
curtains  chimney piece  and door frames  and making green edges to the
family portraits  which were two in number  neither of them by copley
or stuart  as was plain to the most casual observation 

one of these portraits represented the squire s father in a
short waisted  square tailed blue coat  and a canary colored waistcoat 
his forefinger was inserted in a calf bound volume of blackstone  and
his eyes were fixed with a fine judicial directness upon the cupola of
the court house seen through a window in the background  the other was
his wife  in a sad colored gown and muslin tucker  with a countenance
which suggested nothing except saleratus and the renunciation of all
human joys 

the squire did not care much for this picture  it made him feel badly 
he said  just the feeling he used to have when he was a boy and was sent
every sunday by this orthodox parent to study the longer answers of the
shorter catechism on the third step of the garret stairs  with orders
not to stir from that position till he had them perfectly committed to
memory  it was this strict bringing up  perhaps  which made him so
indulgent to milly   a great deal too indulgent her step mother thought 

in the buttery stood a goodly row of cakes little and big  loaves whose
icings shone like snow crust on a sunny day  little cakes with plums
and little cakes without plums  all sorts of cakes  on the swinging
shelf of the cellar were moulds of jelly clear and firm  in the
woodhouse stood three freezers of ice cream   packed  and ready to turn
out  elsewhere were dishes of scalloped oysters ready for the oven  each
with its little edging of crimped crackers  platters of chicken salad 
forms of blanc mange  bowls of yellow custard topped with
raspberry and egg like sunset tinted avalanches  all that goes to the
delectation of a country party  for a party there was to be  as after
this enumeration i need hardly state  it was milly s party  and all
these elaborate preparations were her own work   the work of a girl of
nineteen  with no larger allowance of hands  feet  and spinal vertebræ
than all girls have  and no larger allowance of hours to her day  but
with a much greater share of zeal  energy  and what the squire called
 go  than most young women of her age can boast of 

she it was who had pounded away at the tough sacks full of ice and salt
till they were ready for the freezers  she it was who had beaten the
innumerable eggs for the sponge cakes  pound cakes  fruit cakes   one 
two  three  four   jelly  nut and other cakes  who had swept the rooms 
washed the china  rearranged  changed  brightened everything  like most
other families on croydon hill  the graces kept but one  help   a stout
woman  who could wash  iron  and scrub with the best  and grapple
successfully enough with the simple daily _menu_  but who for finer
purposes was as  unhandy  as a gorilla  all the embellishments  all the
delicate cookeries  fell to the share of the ladies of the household 
which meant milly as a general thing  and in this case particularly  for
the party was hers  and she felt bound to take the burden of it on her
own shoulders as far as possible  especially as her step mother did not
quite approve  and considered that the squire had done a foolish thing
in giving consent   milly should have her way for once   the squire had
announced 

so milly had her way  and had borne herself bravely and brightly through
the fatigues of preparation  but somehow when things were almost ready 
when the table was set  lacking only the last touches  and the fire
lighted  a heavy sense of discouragement fell upon her  it was the
natural reaction after long overwork  but she was too inexperienced to
understand it  she only knew that suddenly the thing she had wished for
seemed undesirable and worth nothing  and that she felt perfectly
miserable  and  didn t care what became of her   she laid her tired head
on the little table by which she was sitting  and  without in the least
intending it  began to cry 

mrs  grace was lying down  the squire was out  there was no one to note
her distress or sympathize with it excepting teakettle  the black cat 
he was sorry for milly after his cat fashion  rubbed his velvet head
against her dress for a little while as if wishing to console her  but
when she took no notice  he walked away and sat down in front of the
door  waiting till some one should open it and let him through  cats
soon weary of the role of comforter  and escape to pleasanter
things   sunshine  bird shadows on the grass  light hearted people who
will play with them and make no appeal to their sympathies 

milly s tears did her no good  she was too physically worn out to find
relief in them  they only deepened her sense of discouragement  the
clock struck six  she roused herself wearily and went upstairs to
dress  there were still the lamps to light and last things to do 

 and no one to do them but me   thought poor milly   oh dear  how
dreadfully my feet ache  how glad i shall be when they all go away and i
can go to bed  

this was indeed a sad state of mind to be in on the eve of a
long anticipated pleasure 

everything looked bright and orderly and attractive when the guests
arrived a little after half past seven  the fire snapped and the candles
shone  a feeling of hospitable warmth was in the air  milly s
arrangements  except so far as they regarded her own well being  had
been judicious and happy  the pretty girls in their short sleeved blue
and crimson merinos  with roses and geranium leaves in their hair  i
need not say that this was at a far back and old fashioned date   looked
every whit as charming as the girls of to day in their more elaborate
costumes 

cousin mary kendal  who  for all her grown up sons and daughters liked
fun as much as any girl among them  had volunteered to play for the
dancing  and the spirit with which she dashed at once into  the caspian
waltz  and  corn rigs are bonny  was enough to set a church steeple to
capering 

everybody seemed in a fair way to have a delightful evening except one
person  that one was poor milly  usually the merriest in every party 
but now dull  spiritless  and inert  she did not even look pretty  color
and sparkle  the chief elements of beauty in her face  were  for the
moment  completely quenched  she was wan and jaded  there were dark
rings under her eyes  and an utter absence of spring to her movements 
usually so quick and buoyant  she sat down whenever she had the chance 
she was silent unless she must speak  half unconsciously she kept a
watch of the clock and was saying to herself   only two hours more and i
can go to bed   her fatigued looks and lack of pleasure were a constant
damper to the animation of the rest  every one noticed  and wondered
what could be the matter  but only janet norcross dared to ask 

 have you got a headache   she whispered  but the  no  which she
received by way of answer sounded so cross that she did not venture on
further inquiries 

 why won t you dance with me   urged will benham   you said you would
when we were talking about the party after the lecture  don t you
remember  

 i d rather the others had the chance  it s my party  you know   replied
milly 

 but they _are_ having a chance  everybody is dancing but you  come 
milly  

 oh  will  don t tease   cried milly irritably   i never saw such an
evening  do please to leave me alone and go and ask some of the others  

weariness sharpened her voice  till the words were out of her lips she
had no idea that she was going to speak so petulantly to will  it
sounded dreadfully even to herself 

 oh  certainly   said will with freezing dignity  he crossed the room 
and presently milly saw him take helen jones out to the set of lancers
just forming  he did not look at milly again  or come near her  and the
sense of his displeasure was just the one drop too much  milly felt
herself choke  a hot rush of tears blinded her eyes  she turned  and
being fortunately near the door  got out of it and upstairs without
suffering her face to be seen 

janet found her half an hour later lying prone across the bed  and
sobbing as if her heart would break 

 what _is_ the matter   she cried in alarm   are you ill  dear milly 
has anything dreadful happened  i came up to look for you  will benham
got worried because you were away so long  and came to me to ask what
had become of you  i told him i guessed you were taking out the
ice creams  but katy said you hadn t been in the kitchen at all  so i
came up here  what is the matter  do tell me  

 oh  nothing is the matter at all  except that i am a perfect idiot  and
so tired that i wish i were dead   said milly   it was awfully good of
will to care  for i spoke so crossly to him  you can t think  it was
horrid of me  but somehow i felt so dreadfully tired that the words
seemed to jump out of my mouth against my will  dear janet  and i was
cross to you  too   added milly penitently   everything has gone wrong
with me to night  oh  and there is that horrible ice cream  i must go
and get it out of the freezers  but my back aches so  janet  and the
soles of my feet burn like fire  

 you poor thing  you are just tired out   said her friend   no wonder 
you must have worked like a horse to make everything so nice and pretty
as it is  don t worry about the ice cream  just tell me what dishes to
put it in  and i ll see to it  it won t take five minutes  but do rouse
yourself now  and keep up a little while longer  the others will wonder
so if you don t go down  you _must_ go down  you know  here is a wet
towel for your eyes  and i ll smooth your hair  

even so small a lift as having the ice cream taken out for her was a
relief  and janet s kindness  and the sense that will was not hopelessly
alienated by her misconduct  helped milly to recover her equilibrium 
soothed and comforted she went downstairs  and got through the rest of
the evening tolerably well 

but when the last good night had been said  and the last sleigh bell had
jingled away from the door  she found herself too tired to rest  all
night long she tossed restlessly on her hot pillows  while visions of
pounding ice and stirring cake  of will s anger  and janet s surprise
when she found her in tears  whirled through her thoughts  when morning
came she was so  poorly  that the doctor was sent for 

 too much party  no doubt   was his inward commentary when he received
the summons  and his first words to milly were   well  missy  so you are
down with fruit cake and mottoes  are you  

 oh  doctor  no  i never ate a mouthful of the cake  i only made it  
was poor milly s disclaimer 

 that sounds serious   said the doctor  but when he had felt her pulse
he looked graver 

 you ve done a good deal too much of something  that is evident   he
said   i shall have to keep you in bed awhile to pay you for it  

milly was forced to submit  she stayed in bed for a whole week and the
greater part of another  missing thereby two candy pulls on which her
heart was set  and the best sleighing frolic of the season  everybody
was kind about coming to see her  and sending her flowers and nice
things  and janet  in particular  spent whole hours with her every day 

 the whole thing seems such a dreadful pity   milly said one day  she
was really better now  able to sit up  and equal to a calm discussion of
her woes   i had looked forward so much to my party  and i wanted to
have it as nice as could be  and i worked so hard  and then  when the
time came  i didn t enjoy it a bit  if i could only have it over again
now when i am all rested and fresh  i should have as good a time as
anybody  doesn t it seem a pity  janet  

 yes  it does   replied janet  after which she fell into a little
musing fit 

 one can t have company without taking some trouble   she said at last 
 but i wonder if one need take so much  

 i don t see what else i could have done   said milly   you must give
people nice things when they come to see you  and somebody has got to
make them  and besides that  there is so much to see to about the
house   dusting  and washing china  and making the rooms nice  

 i know   went on janet reflectively   mrs  beers half killed herself  i
remember  when she had that quilting two years ago  in giving the whole
house a thorough house cleaning beforehand  she said as like as not
somebody would want to run up into the garret chamber after something 
and she should have a fit if it wasn t in order  and after all  not a
soul went anywhere except to the parlor and dining room  and into mrs 
beers s bedroom to take off their things  so the fuss was all thrown
away  and mrs  beers had inflammation of the lungs afterward  and almost
died  

 i recollect  but then they might have gone to the attic  she couldn t
tell  it was natural that mrs  beers should think of it  

 well  and suppose they had  and that there had been a trifle of dust on
the top of some old trunk  what difference would it have made  people
who are busy enjoying themselves don t stop to notice every little
thing  i am going to think the thing over  milly  it s all wrong
somehow  

janet herself was meditating a party  her father had given permission 
and aunt esther  who managed the housekeeping  was only too glad to fall
in with any plan which pleased janet  judge norcross was the richest man
on the hill  there was no reason why janet s entertainment should not
out shine milly s  in fact  she had felt a little ambitious to have it
do so  and had made certain plans in her private mind all of which
involved labor and trouble  but now she hesitated 

 if i m going to be as tired out as milly was  and not enjoy it  what s
the use of having a party at all   she said to herself   i d _like_ to
have it as nice as hers  but whatever i have  i have got to do it all
myself  i m not as strong as milly  i know  and it has half killed
_her_  perhaps it would quite kill me  a party isn t worth that  

she discussed the matter within herself  reasonably  she _could_ wind
herself up and make eight kinds of cake if she liked  there were the
recipes and the materials and she knew how  moreover  aunt esther would
help her  she could have as much jelly and syllabub and blanc mange as
milly  she could turn the house upside down if she desired  and trim and
beautify and adorn  it was a temptation  no girl likes to be outdone 
least of all by her intimate friend   but is it worth while   janet
queried  and i think she proved herself possessed of a very  level head 
when  at last  she decided that it was not 

 i ll be sensible for once   she told herself   a party is not a duty 
it is a pleasure  if i get so tired that i spoil my own pleasure  i
spoil my company s too  for they will be sure to find it out just as
they did at milly s  i couldn t half enjoy anything that night  because
she looked so miserable  and i won t run the risk of having the same
thing happen at our house  i ll just do what is necessary  and leave off
the extras  

the  necessary   when janet came to analyze it  proved to be quite as
much as she was able to undertake  for  as she had admitted to herself 
she was not nearly so strong as milly grace  it meant an ample supply of
two sorts of cake  freshly made and delicate  with plenty of ice cream 
salad  scalloped oysters  and rolls  there was extra china to wash  the
table to set  and the rooms to dust and arrange  and janet was quite
tired enough before it was done  she sent to boston for some preserved
ginger to take the place of the jelly which she didn t make  she made no
attempt at evergreen wreaths  and she wisely concluded that rooms in
their usual state of cleanliness would pass muster with young people
intent on dancing and amusement  that no one would find time to peep
into holes and corners  and that the house could wait to have its
 thorough cleaning  administered gradually after the occasion was over 

there was really a great deal of steady good sense in holding to this
view of the matter  and janet found her reward in the end  the
preparations  even thus simplified  taxed her strength  the extra
touches which she had omitted would have been just the  straw too much  
she gave herself a good margin for rest on the afternoon preceding the
party  and when she came downstairs in her pretty dress of pale blue
cashmere and swan s down  ready to meet her guests  her cheeks and eyes
were as bright as usual  and her spirits were ready for the exhilaration
of excitement 

the tone of any gathering depends in great measure on its hostess  if
she is depressed or under the weather  her visitors are pretty sure to
catch her mood and be affected by it  janet s sunny looks and gay laughs
set the key note of her party  nobody missed the wine jelly or the six
absent sorts of cake  no one wasted a thought on the evergreen wreaths 
all was fun and merriment  and nothing seemed wanting to the occasion 

 what a good time we _have_ had   said helen jones to alice ware as they
stood at the door of the dressing room waiting for their escorts   it s
been ever so much jollier than it was at milly s  and i can t think
why  that was a beautiful party  but somehow people seemed to feel
dull   helen had no idea of being overheard  but as it happened milly
was nearer to her than she thought 

 i ll tell you why it was  helen   she said  coming forward frankly 
 don t look so shocked  i know you didn t mean me to hear  but indeed i
don t mind a bit  and it s quite true besides  janet s party has been a
great deal nicer  and it s because i was such a goose about mine  i did
a great deal too much and got dreadfully tired  so tired that i couldn t
enjoy it  and you all found it out of course  so you couldn t enjoy it
either  i m sure i don t wonder  but it was all my own fault  janet took
warning by my experience and made her party easier  and you see how nice
it has been  we have all had a beautiful time  and so has she 
well  i ve learned a lesson by it  next time i give a party i shall just
do what i can to make it pleasant for you all  and not what i can t  and
i hope it will turn out better for everybody concerned  




the pink sweetmeat 


only three pairs of stockings were left in the shop  it was a very
little shop indeed  scarcely larger than a stall  job tuke  to whom it
belonged  was not rich enough to indulge in the buying of any
superfluous wares  every spring he laid in a dozen dozen of thin
stockings  a bale of cheap handkerchiefs  a gross of black buttons  a
gross of white  a little stationery  and a few other small commodities 
in the autumn he added a dozen dozen of thick stockings  and a box full
of mittens and knitted comforters  besides these he sold penny papers 
and home made yeast made by mrs  tuke  if the stock of wearables grew
scant toward midwinter  job rejoiced in his heart  but by no means made
haste to replenish it  he just laid aside the money needed for the
spring outfit  and lived on what remained  thus it went year after year 
trade was sometimes a little better  sometimes a little worse  but
whichever way it was  job grew no richer  he and his old wife lived
along somehow without coming on the parish for support  and with this
very moderate amount of prosperity they were content 

this year of which i write  the supply of winter stockings had given out
earlier than usual  the weather had been uncommonly cold since october 
which may have been the reason  certain it is  that here at michaelmas 
with december not yet come in  only three pairs of stockings were left
in the little shop  job tuke had told his wife only the week before that
he almost thought he should be forced to lay in a few dozen more  folks
seemed so eager to get  em  but since he said that  no one had asked for
stockings  as it happened  and job  thinking that trade was  after all 
pretty well over for the season  had given up the idea of replenishing
his stock 

one of the three pairs of stockings was a big pair of dark mixed gray 
one pair  a little smaller  was white  and the third  smaller still and
dark blue in color  was about the size for a child of seven or eight
years old 

job tuke had put up the shutters for the night and had gone to bed  the
stockings were talking together in the quiet darkness  as stockings will
when left alone  one pair had been hung in the window  it had got down
from its nail  and was now straddling carelessly with one leg on either
side of the edge of the box in which the others lay  as a boy might on
the top of a stile  this was the big gray pair 

 our chances seem to be getting slim   he said gloomily 

 that is more than you seem   replied the white stockings  in a tart
voice   your ankles are as thick as ever  and your mesh looks to me
coarser than usual to night  

 there are worse things in the world than thickness   retorted the gray
stockings angrily   i m useful  at any rate  i am  while you have no
wear in you  i should say that you would come to darning about the
second wash  if not sooner  

 is that my fault   said the white pair  beginning to cry 

 no  it s your misfortune  but people as unfortunate as you are should
mind their p s and q s  and not say disagreeable things to those who
are better off  

 pray don t quarrel   put in the little blues  who were always
peacemakers   think of our situation  the last survivors of twelve
dozen  we ought to be friends  but  as you say  matters _are_ getting
serious with us  of course we are all thinking about the same thing  

 yes  about the christmas  and the chimney corner   sighed the white
pair   what a dreadful thing it would be if we went to the rag bag never
having held a christmas gift  i could not get over such a disgrace  my
father  my grandfather  all my relations had their chance  some of them
were even hung a second time  

 yes  christmas is woven into our very substance   said the gray
stockings   the old skeins and the ravellings tell the story to the new
wool   the story of the christmas time  the very sheep in the fields
know it  for my part   he added proudly   i should blush to lie in the
same ash heap even with an odd stocking who had died under the disgrace
of never being hung up for christmas  and i will never believe that my
life long dream is to be disappointed  

 why will you use such inflated language   snapped the white pair   you
were only woven last july  as late as may you were running round the
meadow on a sheep s back  

 very well  i don t dispute it  i may not be as old as methuselah  but
long or short  my life is my life  and my dream is my dream  and you
have no call to criticise my expressions  miss   thundered the big pair 

 there you are again   said the little blues   i _do_ wish you wouldn t
dispute  now let us talk about our chances  what day of the month is
it  

 the twenty seventh of november   said the gray stockings  who  because
they hung over the penny papers in the window  always knew the exact
date 

 little more than four weeks to the holidays   said the white pair
dolorously   how i wish some one would come along and put us out of
suspense  

 being bought mightn t do that   suggested the little blues   you might
be taken by a person who had two pairs of stockings  and the others
might be chosen to be hung up  such things do happen  

 oh  they wouldn t happen to me  i think   said the white pair
vaingloriously 

as it happened  the three pairs of stockings were all sold the very day
after this conversation  and all to one and the same person  this was
mrs  wendte  an englishwoman married to a dutch shipwright  she had
lived in holland for some years after her marriage  but now she and her
husband lived in london  they had three children 

the stockings were very much pleased to be bought  when job tuke rolled
them up in paper and tied a stout packthread round them  they nestled
close  and squeezed each other with satisfaction  besides  the joy of
being sold was the joy of keeping together and knowing about each
other s adventures 

the first of these adventures was not very exciting  it consisted in
being laid away in the back part of a bureau drawer  and carefully
locked in 

 now  what is this for   questioned the white stockings   are we to stay
here always  

 yes  that is just what i should like to know   grumbled the big grays 

 why  of course not  who ever heard of stockings being put away for
always   said the wise little blues   wait patiently and we shall see  i
think it is some sort of a surprise  

but day after day passed and nothing happened  surprising or otherwise 
till even the philosophical little blue stockings began to lose heart
and hope  at last  one evening they heard the key click in the lock of
the drawer  a stream of light flashed into their darkness  and they were
seized and drawn forth 

 well  mother  let us see thy purchase  truly fine hosen they are   said
jacob wendte  whose english was rather foreign 

 yes   replied his wife   good  handsome stockings they are  and the
children will be glad  for their old ones are about worn out  the big
pair is for wilhelm  as thou knowest  those must hang to the right of
the stove  

the big gray pair cast a triumphant glance at his companions as he found
himself suspended on a stout nail  this _was_ something like life 

 the white are for greta  and these small ones for little jan  ah  they
are nice gifts indeed   said mrs  wendte  rubbing her hands   a fine
christmas they will be for the children  

the stockings glowed with pleasure  not only were they hung up to
contain presents  but they themselves were christmas gifts  this was
promotion indeed 

 hast thou naught else   demanded jacob wendte of his wife 

 no great things  a kerchief for greta  this comforter for wilhelm  for
the little one  mittens  that is all  

but it was not quite all  for after her husband had gone to bed  mrs 
wendte  a tender look on her motherly face  sought out a small 
screwed up paper  and with the air of one who is a little ashamed of
what she is doing  dropped into each stocking a something made of sugar 
they were not sugar almonds  they were not salem gibraltars   which
delightful confections are unfamiliar to london shops   but irregular
lumps of a nondescript character  which were crumbly and sweet  and
would be sure to please those who did not often get a taste of candy  it
was of little jan that his mother had thought when she bought the
sweetmeats  and for his sake she had yielded to the temptation  though
she looked upon it as an extravagance  there were three of the
sweetmeats  two white  one pink  and the pink one went into jan s
stockings  mrs  wendte had not said anything about them to her husband 

 well  this is satisfactory   said the gray pair  when mrs  wendte had
left the room  and he was sure of not being overheard   here we are all
hanging together on christmas eve  my dream is accomplished  

 mine isn t   said the white pair plaintively   i always hoped that i
should hold something valuable  like a watch or a pair of earrings  it
is rather a come down to have nothing but a bit of candy inside  and a
pocket handkerchief pinned to my leg  i don t half like it  it gives me
an uncomfortable pricking sensation  like a stitch in the side  

 it s just as well for you to get used to it   put in the gray   it
doesn t prick as much as a darning needle  i fancy  and you ll have to
get accustomed to that before long  as i ve remarked before  

 i m the only one who has a pink sweetmeat   said the little blues  who
couldn t help being pleased   and i m for a real child  wilhelm and
greta are more than half grown up  

 real children are very hard on their stockings  i ve always heard  
retorted the white pair  who never could resist the temptation to say a
disagreeable thing 

 that may be  but it is all in the future  this one night is my own  and
i mean to enjoy it   replied the contented little blues 

so the night went  and now it was the dawn of christmas  with the first
light the door opened softly and a little boy crept into the room  this
was jan  when he saw the three pairs of stockings hanging by the stove 
he clapped his hands together  but softly  lest the noise should wake
the others  then he crossed the room on tiptoe and looked hard at the
stockings  he soon made sure which pair was for himself  but he did not
take them down immediately  only stood with his hands behind his back
and gazed at them with two large  pleased eyes 

at last he put his hand up and gently touched the three  felt the little
blue pair  gave it a pat  and finally unhooked it from its nail  then he
sat down on the floor  and began to put them on  his toe encountering an
obstacle  he pulled the stocking off again  put his hand in  and
extracted the pink sweetmeat  with which he was so pleased that he
laughed aloud  that woke up the others  who presently came in 

 ah  little rogue that thou art  always the first to waken   said his
mother  pleased at his pleasure 

 see  mother  see what i found   he cried   it is good  sweet  i have
tasted a crumb already  take some of it  mother  

but mrs  wendte shook her head 

 no   she said   i do not care for sugar  that is for little folks like
thee  eat it thyself  jan  

it was her saying this  perhaps  which prevented wilhelm and greta from
making the same offer   at least  i hope so  certain it is that neither
of them made it  greta ate hers up on the spot  with the frank
greediness of a girl of twelve who does not often get candy  wilhelm
buttoned his up in his trousers pocket  all three made haste to put on
the new stockings  the three pairs had only time to hastily whisper as
they were separated   

 to night perhaps we may meet again  

the pink sweetmeat went into the pocket of jan s jacket  and he carried
it about with him all the morning  he did not eat it  because once eaten
it would be gone  and it was a greater pleasure to have it to look
forward to  than to enjoy it at the moment  jan was a thrifty little
boy  as you perceive 

being christmas  it was of course an idle day  jacob wendte never knew
what to do with such  there was his pipe  and there was beer to be had 
so in default of other occupation  he amused himself with these  mrs 
wendte had her hands full with the dinner  and was frying sausages and
mixing yorkshire pudding all the morning  only greta went to church  she
belonged to a parish school where they gave christmas prizes  and by no
means intended to lose her chance  but  apart from that  she really
loved church going  for she spoke english and understood it better than
either of the other children  wilhelm went off on errands of his own 
little jan spent the morning in admiring his stockings  and in wrapping
and unwrapping his precious sweetmeat  and taking it out of his pocket
and putting it in again 

 why dost thou not eat it  dear   asked his mother  as she lifted the
frying pan from the stove 

but he answered   oh  not yet  when once it is eaten  it is over  i will
wait  

 how long wilt thou wait   she asked 

jan said bashfully   i don t know  

in truth  he had not made up his mind about the sweetmeat  only he felt
instinctively that he did not want to hurry  and shorten his pleasure 

dinner over  he went out for a walk  every now and then  as he marched
along  his hand would steal into his pocket to finger his precious candy
and make sure that it was safe 

it was a gray afternoon  but not snowing or raining  hyde park was not
too far away for a walk  and jan went there  the serpentine was skimmed
over with ice just strong enough to bear boys  and quite a little crowd
was sliding or skating upon it  jan could skate very well  he had
learned in holland  but he made no attempt to join the crowd  he was
rather shy of english boys  for they sometimes laughed at his hollander
clothes or his dutch accent  and he did not like to be laughed at 

so he strolled away  past the serpentine and the skaters  and watched
the riders in the row for a while  there were not a great many  for
people who ride are apt to be out of london at the christmas time  but
there were some pretty horses  and one fair little girl on a pony who
took jan s fancy very much  he stood for a long time watching her trot
up and down  and the idea occurred to him that he would like to give her
his sweetmeat  he even put his hand into his pocket and half pulled it
out  but the little girl did not look his way  and presently her father 
with whom she was riding  spoke to her  and she turned her horse s head
and trotted off through the marble arch  jan dropped the sugarplum again
into his pocket  and felt as if his sudden fancy had been absurd  and
indeed i think the little girl would have been surprised and puzzled
what to do had he carried out the intention 

after the pony and his little mistress had departed  jan lost his
interest in the riders  and walked away across the park  once he stopped
to look at a dear little dog with a blue collar  who seemed to have lost
his master  for he was wandering about by himself  and smelling
everybody and everything he met  as if to recover a lost trail  jan
called him  he came up in a very friendly way and allowed himself to be
patted  and once more the sweetmeat was in danger  for jan had taken it
out with the intention of dividing it with this new friend  when a
whistle was heard which the little dog evidently recognized  and he
darted off at once to join his master  so again the pink sweetmeat was
put back into jan s pocket  and he walked on 

he had gone quite a distance when he saw a number of people collected
round the foot of a tree  a ladder was set against one of the lower
branches  and a man had climbed up nearly to the top of the tree  jan 
like a true boy  lost no time in joining the crowd  but at first he
could not make out what was going on  the boughs were thick  all that he
could see was the man s back high up overhead  and what he was doing he
could not guess 

a benevolent looking old gentleman stood near  and jan heard him exclaim
with great excitement 

 there  he s got him  no  he s not  but it was a close shave  

 got what  sir   he ventured to ask 

 why  the rook  to be sure  

then  seeing that jan still looked puzzled  he took the trouble to
explain 

 you see that rook up there  my lad  don t you   jan had not seen any
rook at all   well it is caught in some way  how  i can t tell you  but
it can t get away from the tree  it has been there three days  they
say  and all that time the other rooks have brought food to it  and kept
it from starving  now some one has gone up to see what is the
difficulty  and  if possible  to set the poor thing free  

 thank you  sir   said jan 

and the old gentleman looked at him kindly  and said to himself   

 a very civil  tidy little lad  i like his face  

jan had now become deeply interested in what was going on  he stood on
tiptoe  and stretched his neck  but all he could see was the man s back
and one of his feet  and now and then the movement of a stick with which
the man seemed to be trying to hit something  at last there was a great
plunge and a rustling of branches  and people began to hurrah  jan
hurrahed too  though he still saw nothing very clearly  but it is easier
to shout when other boys shout  if you happen to be a boy  than it is to
keep still 

slowly the man in the tree began to come down  he had only one hand to
help himself with now  for the other held the heavy rook  we in america
do not know what rooks are like  but in england they are common enough 
they are large black birds  something like our crows  but they look
wiser  and are a good deal bigger 

as the man neared the ground  every one in the crowd could see what had
been the matter with the rook  a kite string  caught among the tree
branches  had tangled his legs and held him fast  he had pulled so hard
in his efforts to escape that the string had cut into one of his legs
and half broken it  it was stiff and bleeding  and the rook could
neither fly nor hop  people searched in their pockets  and one little
girl  who had a half biscuit  began to feed the rook  who  for all the
kindly efforts of his friends  seemed to be half famished  the poor
thing was too weak to struggle or be frightened  and took the crumbs
eagerly from the girl s hand 

jan thought of his sweetmeat  and took it out for the third time 
everybody was crowding round the man who held the rook  and he could not
get near  a very tall policeman stood in front of him  jan pulled his
arm  and when he turned  handed him the sweetmeat  and said in his soft
foreign english   

 for the bird  sir  

 thank you  my dear   said the policeman 

he had not understood what jan said  and in an abstracted way  with his
eyes still fixed on the rook  he bit the pink sweetmeat in two  and
swallowed half of it at a mouthful  fortunately jan did not see this 
for the policeman s back was turned to him  but observing that the man
made no attempt to go forward  he pulled his sleeve for the second time 
and again said   

 for the bird  i said  sir  

this time the policeman heard  and taking one step forward  he held the
remaining half of the sweetmeat out to the rook  who  having by this
time grown used to being fed  took the offered dainty greedily  jan saw
the last pink crumb vanish into the long beak  but he felt no regret 
his heart had been touched by the suffering of the poor bird  and he was
glad to give what he could to make it forget those painful days in the
tree 

so that was the end of the pink sweetmeat  or not quite the end  the
kind old gentleman to whom jan had spoken  had noticed the little
transaction with the policeman  he was shrewd as well as kind  he
guessed by jan s clothes that he was a working man s son  to whom sweets
were not an every day affair  and the generous act pleased him  so he
put his hand into _his_ pocket  pulled out a half crown  and watching
his opportunity  dropped it into jan s pocket  quite empty now that the
sweetmeat was gone  then  with a little chuckle  he walked away  and jan
had no suspicion of what had been done to him 

gradually the crowd dispersed  jan among the rest walking briskly  for
he wanted to get home and tell his mother the story  it was not till
after supper that he discovered the half crown  and then it seemed to
him like a sort of dream  as if fairies had been at work  and turned the
pink sweetmeat into a bit of silver 

that night the three pairs of stockings had another chance for
conversation  the blue ones and the gray ones lay close together on the
floor of the room where jan slept with his brother  and the white ones 
which greta had carelessly dropped as she jumped into bed  were near
enough the half opened door to talk across the sill 

 it has been an exciting day   said the white pair   my girl got a
keble s  christian year  at her school  it was the second best prize  it
is a good thing to belong to respectable people who take prizes  only
one thing was painful to me  she wriggled her toes so with pleasure that
i feel as if i were coming to an end in one of my points  

 you probably are   remarked the big gray   yes  now that i examine  i
can see the place  one stitch has parted already  and there is quite a
thin spot  you know i always predicted that you would be in the rag bag
before you knew it  

 oh  don t say such dreadful things   pleaded the little blues   mrs 
wendte will mend her  i am sure  and make her last  what did your girl
do with her sweetmeat  

 ate it up directly  of course  what else should one do with a
sweetmeat   snapped the white pair crossly   oh  dear  my toe feels
dreadfully ever since you said that  quite neuralgic  

 my boy was not so foolish as to eat his sweetmeat   said the big gray
stockings   only girls act in that way  without regard to anything but
their greedy appetites  he traded his with another boy  and he got a
pocket knife for it  three screws  and a harmonica  there  

 was the knife new   asked the blue 

 could the harmonica play any music   demanded the white 

 no  the harmonica is out of order inside somehow  but perhaps my boy
can mend it  and the knife isn t new  quite old  in fact  and its blade
is broken at the end  still  it s a knife  and wilhelm thinks he can
trade it off for something else  and now for your adventures  what did
_your_ boy do with his sweetmeat  little blues  did he eat it  or trade
it  

 it is eaten   replied the blue stockings cautiously 

 eaten  then of course he ate it  why don t you speak out  if he ate it 
say so  if he didn t  who did  

 well  nobody ate the whole of it  and my boy didn t eat any  it was
divided between two persons  or rather  between one person and  and  a
thing that is not a person  

 bless me  what are you talking about  i never heard anything so absurd
in my life  persons  and things that are not persons   said the white
pair   what do you mean  

 yes  what _do_ you mean  what is the use of beating about the bush in
this way   remonstrated the big gray pair   who did eat the sweetmeat 
say plainly  

 half of it was eaten by a policeman  and the other half by a rook  
replied the little blues  in a meek voice 

 ho  ho   roared the gray stockings  while the white pair joined in with
a shrill giggle   that beats all  half by a policeman  and half by a
rook  a fine way to dispose of a christmas sweetmeat  your boy must be a
fool  little blues  

 not a fool at all   said the blue pair indignantly   now just listen to
me  your girl ate hers up at once  and forgot it  your boy traded his
away  and what has he got  a broken knife  and a harmonica that can t
play music  i don t call those worth having  my boy enjoyed his
sweetmeat all day  he had more pleasure in giving it away than if he had
eaten it ten times over  besides  he got half a crown for it  an old
gentleman slipped it into his pocket because he was pleased with his
kind heart  i saw him do it  

 half a crown   ejaculated the white pair  with amazement 

 that _is_ something like   admitted the big gray stockings   your boy
did the best of the three  i admit  

the little blues said no more 

presently the others fell asleep  but she lay and watched jan as he
rested peacefully beside his brother  with his wonderful treasure  the
silver coin  clasped tight in his hand  he smiled in his sleep as though
his dreams were pleasant 

 even if he had no half crown  still he would have done the best   she
whispered to herself at last 

then the clock struck twelve  and the day after christmas was begun 




etelka s choice 


etelka lived on the very borders of the fairy country 

it may be that some of you do not believe that there are any such beings
as fairies  in fact  it is not easy to hold to one s faith in them when
one lives in such a country as this of ours  fairies are the shyest of
creatures  shyer than the wood dove  shyer than the glancing dragon fly 
they love silence  seclusion  places where they can sport unseen with no
intruding voice or step to startle them  when man comes they go  and i
put it to you whether it is likely that they can enjoy themselves in the
united states  where every forest with any trees in it worth cutting
down is liable at any moment to be attacked by an army of wood choppers 
where streams are looked upon as  water power   lakes as  water supply  
and ponds as suitable places for the breeding of fish  where distance
is brought near by railroads  and solitudes only mean a chance for a
settler  where people are always poking about the hills and mountains in
search of coal mines or silver mines  and prodding the valleys in hopes
of oil wells  and where silence generally means an invitation to a
steam whistle of one kind or another 

but where etelka lived no one doubted the reality of fairies any more
than they did that of human beings  her home was in bohemia  in the
outskirts of the _boehmer wald_  a vast  unpeopled tract of mountainous
country thickly wooded  full of game  and seldom visited except by
hunting parties in pursuit of stags or wild boars  etelka s people were
of mixed sclavonic and gypsy origin  they cultivated a patch of land
under the stewardship of a lord who never came near his estate  but this
was only their ostensible occupation  for poaching or smuggling goods
across the frontier brought in a great deal more money to them than did
farming  there were three sons  marc  jocko  and hanserl  etelka was the
only girl  they were lithe  sinewy young fellows  with the swarthy skins
and glittering black eyes which belonged to their gypsy blood  and
something furtive and threatening in their looks  but she was different 
her hair and eyes were of a warm brown  her features were delicate  and
their expression was wistful and sweet  all summer long she ran about
with her slender feet and ankles bare  a thin little cotton gown and a
bead necklace composed her wardrobe for the warmer months  in winter she
wore woollen stockings and wooden shoes  a stuff petticoat and a little
shawl  she was always shabby  often ragged  and on cold days scarcely
ever warm enough to be comfortable  but she somehow looked pretty in her
poor garments  for beauty is the gift of heaven  and quite as often sent
to huts as to palaces  no one had ever told etelka that she was pretty 
except indeed young sepperl of the mill  whom she had seen now and again
on her semi annual visits to the neighboring village to dispose of her
yarn  and he had said more with his eyes than with his tongue 

to her family it made no difference whatever whether she was pretty or
not  they preferred to have her useful  and they took care that she
should be so  she spun and sewed  she cleaned the pots and pans  cooked
the rye porridge and the cabbage soup  and rarely got a word of thanks
for her pains  her brothers flung her their jackets to mend or their
game to dress  without a word of ceremony  if she had refused or delayed
to attend to their wants she would have got a rough word  a curse  or
perhaps a blow  but etelka never refused  she was a willing little
creature  kindly and cheerful  and had no lazy blood in her veins  so
early and late she worked for them all  and her chief  almost her only
pleasure was when  her tasks despatched  she could escape from the hut
with its atmosphere of smoke and toil  and get away into the forest by
herself 

when once the green and fragrant hush of the high arched thickets closed
her in  she would give a sigh of relief  and a sense of being at home
took possession of her  she did not feel it in the hut  though she
called that home  and it was the only one she had ever known 

did etelka believe in fairies  indeed she did  she had a whole volume of
stories about them at her tongue s end  her great grandmother had seen
them often  so had her great aunt  the mother of dame gretel  the wise
woman of the village  who herself passed for a witch  had been on
intimate terms for a long time with a hoary little kobold who had
taught her all manner of marvellous things  the same fortunate woman had
once seen rubesal  the mountain demon  and had left an account of him
and his looks  which were exactly those of a charcoal burner  etelka
knew the very hollow where dame gretel s mother used to sit and listen
to the teachings of the kobold  and could point out the ring where a
number of the  good people  had once been seen moving a mystic dance 
their wings glancing in the darkness like fire flies  she  herself  had
never seen a fairy or a kobold  it is true  everybody was not thus
fortunate  but she might some day  who knew  and meantime she had often
heard them whispering and sighing in their odd little voices close
beside her  you may be sure that etelka believed in fairies  it was one
reason why she liked so well to go to the great forest  which was their
well known abiding place 

one day the desire to escape from home was unusually strong upon her 
her mother was out of sorts for some reason and had been particularly
harsh  her father  who sometimes stood her friend  had gone to the
village with a bundle of hare skins which he hoped to trade for oil and
brandy  her brothers  who had some private expedition on foot  had kept
her running since early morning  she had grown tired and a little cross
at their many exactions  and when  finally  all was made ready  and they
set out with their guns and snares and a knapsack full of food  and her
mother  sitting with her pipe beside the fire  had fallen into a doze 
etelka gladly closed the door behind her and stole away  the soup was
simmering in its pot  the bowls were ready set on the table  she would
not be missed  for an hour or two she might feel that she belonged to
herself 

the forest felt deliciously cool and still as she walked fast up the
little glade which led to the fairy spring  this was a small pool of
clear water  bubbling strongly up from a sandy bottom  and curiously
walled round with smooth stones  which seemed fitted and joined by the
labor of man  though in reality they were a freak of nature 

etelka sat herself down on this stony rim  dipped her hands in the water
and sprinkled a little on her hot forehead  a tall spear of feathery
grass grew just by  presently it began to bend and sway as if
wind blown  and dance lightly up and down before her face  she took no
notice at first  then it occurred to her  as no wind was blowing
anywhere else  it was odd that this particular grass blade should be in
such active motion 

 how queer   she said  looking hard at the grass blade   it seems to be
alive  

a shrill  small laugh echoed her words  and suddenly  as if her eyes had
been magically opened to see  she became aware that a tiny shape in
green  with a pointed cap on its head  was sitting upon the blade of
grass and moving it to and fro with hand and foot  the little
countenance under the cap was full of mischief and malice  and the
bright eyes regarded her with a strange glee  etelka knew instantly that
her wish had come true  and that at last she was face to face with a
veritable fairy 

 oh   was all she could say in her amazement 

 well  stupid  do you know who i am   asked the creature in a voice as
shrill as its laugh 

 yes  mein herr   faltered etelka 

 here you have gone about all your days wishing you could see a fairy  
continued the small creature   and there we were close by all the time 
and you never opened your eyes to look  how do you like me now you do
see me  

 very much  herr fairy   replied etelka  gaining courage   i think you
are beautiful  

the fairy seemed pleased at this compliment  which was evidently
sincere 

 thou art a good maiden enough  as maidens go   he said  accosting her
more familiarly   i have long had my eye on thee  etelklein  i have sat
up in the roof thatch and heard jocko and hanserl scold and hector  and
the mother order thee about  and i have noted that thou wast almost
always kind and humble  and seldom answered them back again  thou art
neat handed  too  and that we fairies think much of  many a drink of
good new milk have i had  which i should have missed hadst thou
forgotten to scour the pail  so now in return i will do something for
thee  listen 

 thou must know that each fairy of the _boehmer wald_ has the privilege
once every hundred years of granting one wish to a mortal  all do not
exercise it  some crabbed ones do not like the human folk enough to be
willing to do them a good turn  others again are too lazy or too
pleasure loving to go out of their way for the purpose  i am neither of
these  now  hearken  i will give thee the power that every time thou
dancest a piece of gold shall lie under thy foot  or  instead of the
gold  a flower shall spring up out of the ground  which wilt thou have  

 yes  which wilt thou have   cried another sharp voice  and a second
fairy appeared  out of the air as it were  and seated himself on the
very tip of the grass blade   don t be in a hurry  think a bit before
you choose  etelka  why  child  what are you looking so scared about  

for etelka had grown pale  and had not been able to repress a little
scream at this sudden apparition  she rallied her courage and tried to
look brave  but her heart misgave her  was the wood full of these unseen
creatures 

 it is only my gossip   explained fairy number one   thimblerig is his
name  mine is pertzal  he usually comes after me wherever i go  you
needn t be afraid of _him_  now  gold piece or flower  decide  

etelka was in a whirl of confusion  it was dreadful to have to make up
her mind all in a moment about such an important thing  her thoughts
flew to sepperl of the mill  he was fond of flowers  she knew  the mill
garden was always full of blue flax  poppies  and lavender  and sepperl
spent all his spare hours in working over it  suppose  suppose  the
thing over which she had sometimes shyly glowed and blushed were to
happen  how pleasant it would be to dance flowers all day long for
sepperl 

then her mind reverted to the hut  to her mother and the boys  who were
always craving after the luxuries of life which they could not have  and
fiercely envying those who were better off than themselves  would they
not be happier and better and kinder for the gold which she had it in
her power to give them  they would not forgive her if she lost such a
chance  that she knew  and even so far as sepperl went  gold never came
amiss to a poor man s door  so many things could be bought with it 

 one cannot eat flowers   said etelka to herself with a sigh  yet still
she hesitated  and her heart felt heavy within her 

 choose   repeated the two fairies  each echoing the other 

 i choose the gold piece   said etelka  the fairy faces clouded over as
she spoke  and she knew she had chosen wrong 

 very well   said pertzal   have thy wish   he vanished as he spoke 
etelka sat alone by the bubbling spring  and she rubbed her eyes and
asked herself if it were not all a dream 

 i will put it to the test   she thought  and jumping up she began to
dance beneath the trees  slowly and doubtfully at first  and then with
swift and joyful bounds and steps  for as she danced  ever and anon upon
the ground beneath her feet appeared a glittering coin  she danced so
long that when at last she ceased she sank down exhausted  the beautiful
yellow pieces lay thickly around her  some larger  some smaller  as if
their size depended upon the vigor of her movements  she had never
dreamed of such wealth before  and she gathered them up and tied them in
the corner of her shawl  half fearing they might turn to brass or
pebbles  but when she neared home and looked at them again they were
still gold 

her mother was standing at the door with a black look on her face 

 where hast thou been  thou idle baggage   she demanded   i drop asleep
for one moment  and when i wake the fire is well nigh out  

etelka glanced at the setting sun  in her excitement she had not marked
the flight of time  it was much later than she had supposed 

 i am sorry   she faltered  then  to appease her mother s anger  she
untied the corner of her shawl and showed the fairy money 

 see what i have brought   she said   they are all for thee  

the old woman fairly gasped in her surprise 

 gold   she cried  clutching the coins which etelka held out   real
gold  more than i ever saw before  where didst get it  girl  who gave it
thee  

 the fairies   exclaimed etelka joyfully   and they taught me how to get
more when we are again in need  

 do you dare to make a mock of me   screamed her mother  aiming a blow
at her with the staff which she held in her hand   fairies indeed  a
fine story  tell the truth  hussy  didst thou meet some count in the
forest  or the landgrave himself  

 i met nobody   persisted etelka   no one at all except the fairy and
the other fairy  and it was they who gave me the gift  

her mother s staff descended with a whack on her shoulder 

 get thee in   she said harshly   thou are lying   but she held fast to
the gold all the same  and when etelka s back was turned she hid it
secretly away 

so the first fruit of the fairy gift was a blow 

later  when the father came back from the village  there was another
scene of severity and suspicion  neither of etelka s parents believed
her story  they treated her like a culprit who will not confess his
guilt  it was worse yet when her brothers returned the following day  in
vain she wept and protested  in vain she implored them to believe her 

 it s easy enough to talk   jocko declared at last   but to prove thy
words is not so easy  if thou hast the power to dance gold pieces into
existence  why  face to work and dance  then we shall know whether or
not to believe thee  

strange to say  this method of proving her veracity had not occurred to
etelka s mind  after her troubled sleep and unhappy day she had begun
to feel that the interview with the fairies was no more than a dream 
and she scarcely ventured on the test  dreading that the strange gift
bestowed upon her might have been withdrawn 

slowly and fearfully she began to dance  while her family watched every
movement with eyes of scornful incredulity  suddenly marc  uttering a
great oath  stooped and picked up something from the hard trodden
earthen floor  it was a gold piece 

 by heavens   he exclaimed   the girl spoke true  or   with a return of
suspicion   is it one of those she gave thee which thou hast dropped  
turning to his mother 

but as etelka  with heart suddenly grown lighter  went on bounding and
twirling  one shining coin after another shone out on the floor beneath
her feet  and with howls and screams of joy her relatives precipitated
themselves upon them  it seemed as if they could never have enough  if
etelka paused to rest they urged her on 

 dance thou   they cried   dance  etelklein  liebchen  susschen 
darling of our hearts  do not stop  keep on till we are all rich  

one hour  two  passed  and still etelka obeyed their eager behest and
danced on  the boys  pockets  her father s pouch  her mother s lap were
full  and yet they demanded more 

at last  quite worn out  she sank in a heap on the ground 

 i cannot take another step   she sighed 

 oh  well   jocko reluctantly admitted   that may do for to night 
to morrrow we will have some more of it  

from that day all was changed for the family in the forest hut  every
one  except etelka  fell to work straightway to squander the fairy gold 
the sons made expeditions to the distant town  and came back laden with
goods of the most incongruous kinds   silks  velvets  tobacco 
gold embroidered caps  bonbons  carved pipes  gayly painted china  gilt
clocks  toys of all descriptions  anything and everything which had
pleased their untutored fancy  the father and mother smoked all day
long  till the air of the hut was dense and stifling  brandy and
_kirsch wasser_ flowed in streams  etelka alone profited nothing from
the fairy gift  to be sure she had her share of the dainties which the
others devoured  and her brothers now and then tossed her a ribbon or a
brightly colored handkerchief  but for these she did not much care  and
her liberty  for which she did care  was greatly abridged  no longer was
she suffered to wander at will in the forest  she had become too
precious for that  something might happen to her  they all declared  a
bear or a wolf might come along and attack her  or she might slip and
sprain her ankle  which  so far as they were concerned  would be just as
bad  no  etelka must run no risks  she must stay at home  and be ready
to dance for them whenever they needed her 

the slender limbs grew very weary  and the heart which gave them life
was often heavy  as time went on  and more and more gold was needed to
satisfy the exactions of her family  money easily won is still more
easily spent  the fairy gold melted fast in the rapacious fingers which
clutched it  soon  for appetite grows by what it feeds upon  the little
hut no longer sufficed the growing ambition of etelka s brothers  it was
too poor  too lonely  too everything  they declared  they must all
remove to budweis or linz  the city was the only fit place for people to
live in who had money to spend 

etelka was not consulted  she was ordered to pack this and that  and to
leave the other behind  that was all  and was made to dance a few extra
hours to pay the travelling expenses  all the homely old furniture was
left in the hut  as not smart enough for the grand city home they were
going to  they took only the things they had bought since their good
luck began  but these filled a great cart  on the top of which etelka
and her mother were perched  she cast one last look toward her beloved
forest  to which she had not been allowed a farewell visit  jocko
cracked his long whip  the oxen slowly moved forward   good by to
everything   said etelka in her heart  but she dared not say it aloud 

a quick pang shot through her as they passed the mill garden  gay with
flowers  where sepperl  hoe in hand  was standing  his eyes met hers
with deep and silent reproach  then were averted  she did not
understand  but it made her very sad  no one had told her that a few
weeks before  sepperl had asked her in marriage of her father  and had
been roughly refused  such an offer would have been looked upon as
unheard of good fortune six months previously  now it was regarded
almost as an insult  marry etelka  take their gold earner away from
them  it was out of the question  what was the fool thinking of  but
etelka heard nothing of all this 

haunted by the recollection of sepperl s wistful glance  she went her
way with the others  little heart had she for the new home which seemed
to them so fine  it was high up in an old building  overlooking a
crowded street  the rooms seemed very large and empty after the forest
hut  and the first care of the family was to furnish them  with reckless
disregard of good taste as well as of expense  marc and jocko and
hanserl rushed away to the market and the shops  and presently the
stairs began to fill with porters bringing up all manner of
things   beds and chairs and tables  gaudy carpets for the floors 
ill painted pictures in showy frames for the walls  a piano on which
none of them knew how to play  a music box of extraordinary size which
could play without assistance  looking glasses  lamps  wonderful china
figures  a parrot in a gilded cage  with a dreadful command of profane
language  the rooms were filled and more than filled in no time  and
for the payment of all these things etelka must dance 

and dance she did  but with a heavy heart and no spring in her feet 
accustomed to the quiet of the forest neighborhood  the sounds and
smells of the city oppressed her greatly  the crowd and bustle
frightened her  the roar of noise kept her awake at night  she felt as
if she could not breathe  things grew worse rather than better  their
extravagance provoked notice  and the fame of their riches and their
ignorance soon brought about them a crew of tempters and needy
adventurers  men with evil eyes and sly greedy faces began to appear at
all hours  to smoke and drink with marc and jocko  to gamble with them
and win their money  much money did they win  and all that was lost
etelka must make good  with her will or without it  she must
dance   dance always to content her rapacious kindred  they could hardly
endure to spare her for the most needful rest  time and again when she
had sunk exhausted on her bed to sleep  while dice rattled and glasses
clinked in the next room  hanserl or jocko had rushed in to awaken her
roughly and demand that she should get up at once and dance  stumbling
and half blind with drowsiness the poor girl would do her best  but her
movements being less brisk and buoyant  the coins would be of smaller
value  and she would be sworn at for her pains  and threatened with dire
penalties if she did not do better next time 

no wonder that under this treatment she grew pale and thin  the pretty
cheeks lost their roundness  the pink faded from them  her eyes were
dull and lustreless  a great homesickness took possession of her  night
and day she pined for the forest hut  so wan and unhappy was she  that
even the hard hearts of those who profited by her should have been
touched by it  but no one noticed her looks or cared that she was
unhappy  so long as she would keep on dancing and coin gold for them 

at last came a day when she could not rise from her bed  marc came and
threatened her  he even pulled her on to her feet  but it was in vain 
she fell down with weakness and could not stand  alarmed at last  jocko
hastened after a doctor  he came  felt etelka s pulse  shook his head 

 what has she been doing   he asked 

nothing  they told him  nothing at all  then he shook his head still
more portentously 

 ah  well  in that case it is all of no use   he said   she is all given
out  she must die  

and now indeed those who had let etelka tire herself to death for them
were thoroughly frightened  with her would perish all their hopes  for
the gold she had earned for them had been spent as fast as made  nothing
had been laid up  they took wonderfully good care of her now  there was
nothing she fancied that they would not willingly have brought her  but
all the poor child asked for was to be left alone and suffered to lie
still  not to be forced to keep on with that weary dancing 

gradually the spent flame of life flickered feebly upward within her 
and as she gained a little in strength  a longing after the forest took
possession of her  the wish seemed utterly foolish to her family  but
they would not refuse it  for their one desire was to have her get well
and able to earn gold for them again  so the big wagon and the oxen were
hired  etelka on her bed was laid carefully in it  marc took the goad 
and slowly  slowly  the sick girl was carried back to her old home 

all was unchanged there  dust lay thickly on the rude furniture which
had been left behind  on the pots and pans which hung upon the wall  but
no one had meddled with them or lifted the latch of the door since the
family went away  the cool hush and stillness of the place was like a
balm to etelka s overstrained nerves  she slept that night as she had
not slept for weeks  and on the morrow was visibly stronger  marc did
not stay with her long  the quiet of the hut disgusted him  and after
enduring it for a day or two he went back to the others in the city 
leaving etelka alone with her father and mother  he gave strict orders
that he was to be sent for the moment that etelka was able to use her
feet again  then  indeed  she must fall to work and dance to make up for
all this wasted time 

poor etelka rejoiced to see him go  she had learned to fear her brothers
and almost to dislike them 

the day after he went  she begged her father to carry her in his arms to
the edge of the forest and lay her under a tree  she wanted to feel the
wind in her face again  she said  he consented at last  though grumbling
a little at the trouble  etelka was comfortably placed on a bear skin
under the shade of a spreading fir  and after a while  as her eyes were
closed and she seemed to be asleep  her father stole away and left her 
she was in full sight of the hut  so there seemed no danger in leaving
her alone 

but etelka was not asleep  she was thinking with all her might  thinking
of the fairy  wishing she could see him again and ask him to undo the
fatal gift which had brought such misery into her life 

suddenly  as she lay thinking these thoughts  her cheek was tickled
sharply  she opened her eyes  there stood the same odd little figure in
green which she had seen before  as then a grass blade was in his hand 
and leaning over his shoulder was his gossip thimblerig  etelka almost
screamed in her joy 

 thou seemest pleased to see us   remarked pertzal with a mocking smile 

 oh  i am glad  indeed i am   cried poor etelka   dear kind herr fairy 
have pity  don t let me dance gold any more  

 what  tired already  what queer creatures mortals be   began pertzal
teasingly  but the kinder thimblerig interposed 

 tired of her gift  of course she is  you knew she would be when you
gave it  gossip  don t plague the poor child  look how thin she has
grown  but  etelka  i must tell thee that when once a fairy has granted
to a mortal his wish  he has no power to take it back again  

 what   cried etelka in despair   must i then go on dancing forever till
i die  

 he cannot take it back   repeated thimblerig   but do not cry so  there
is another way  a second fairy can grant a wish which will contradict
the first  and so all may be made right  now  etelka  i have a kindness
for thee as well as pertzal here  and like him i have the right to grant
a favor to a mortal  now  listen  dance thee never so well or dance thee
never so long  from henceforward shall never gold piece lie under foot
of thine for all thy dancing  and  furthermore  if ever thou art married
to a man whom thou lovest  i endow thee with this gift  that when thou
dancest with will and because thy heart is light  violets and daisies
and all sweet blossoms shall spring at thy tread  till all about thee is
as a garden  

 now i will add this piece of advice   said pertzal  grinning
maliciously   if ever this does happen  hold thy tongue about thy gift
to thy husband  the best of men can hardly resist the temptation of
making money out of their womenkind   safety lies in silence  

 oh  how can i thank you   sighed etelka 

 thank us by being happy   said thimblerig  then the fairies faded from
sight  and etelka was alone 

i have not time to tell of the wrath of etelka s father and mother and
brothers  when  as she grew strong enough to dance again for their
bidding  it was found that no gold pieces followed her light steps  and
that the fairy gift had been withdrawn  their ill humor and discontent
made the life of the hut worse than ever it had been before  etelka sank
into her former insignificance  very willingly and faithfully she worked
for them all  but she could not win them to content  one after another
the boys departed from home  marc enlisted as a soldier  jocko joined a
party of smugglers and disappeared over the italian frontier  hanserl
took service with the charcoal burners high up on the mountains  when
sepperl of the mill asked again for etelka s hand in marriage the
following year  there was no question as to what answer should be given
him  her father was only too glad to say yes  etelka was made happy at
last 

she had been a wife several months before she made trial of her second
fairy gift  it was one evening when she and sepperl were in their
garden  and he was telling her his plans with regard to a bit of waste
land which he had lately fenced in 

 it will take many roots and seeds to make it like the rest   he
remarked   but little by little we can do it without feeling the cost 
and in the end it will be the best of all  

then  with a sudden flash in her eyes  etelka left her husband and began
to dance  to and fro over the bare earth she sped with quick graceful
steps  now advancing  now retreating  now describing circles  with her
arm poised above her head like wings and her laughing eyes fixed on
sepperl  he was puzzled by this freak on the part of his pretty wife 
but stood watching her with great admiration  her cheeks were so
flushed  and her movements so light and dainty 

she stopped at last  came to him  and laid her hand on his arm 

 illustration  then with a sudden flash in her eyes  etelka left her
husband and began to dance   _page 202_  

 now look   she said 

and lo  where had been bare  brown earth a half hour before  was now a
green sward enamelled all over with buttercups  violets  pink and white
michaelmas daisies  and pansies of every shade of gold and purple 

sepperl stood transfixed   hast thou commerce with the elves   he asked 

but etelka did not reply  the words of pertzal recurred to her memory 
 silence is safety   and they were like a wise hand laid on her lips 
she only laughed like a silver bell  shook her head  and left on
sepperl s cheek a happy kiss 




the fir cones 

an idyl of christmas eve 


 well  the old tree has gone at last   said the farmer  as he latched
the heavy door and began to stamp the snow from his boots 

 what tree   cried a girl s voice  as the whir of the busy wheel
suddenly slackened   oh  father  not the lovers  tree   the old fir 
surely thou canst not mean _that_  

 no other  hilda  the lovers  tree  under which thy mother and i
exchanged our troth plight more than twenty years back  hey  dame   and
he turned with a smile to where his wife sat in the sunset light 
humming a low tune to the accompaniment of her clicking needles  she
smiled back in answer 

 yes  paul  and my mother as well  and thine too  i ll be bound  for she
also was a brelau girl  all brelau knows the fir   a hundred years old
it was  they say  

 more than that   said the farmer   my grandfather courted his lass
under its shade  and his father did the same  add a hundred and fifty to
your hundred  and it won t be so far amiss  wife  but it has fallen at
last  there ll be no more maidens wooed and won under the lovers  tree 
thou hast lost thy chance  hilda   and he turned fondly to his girl 

 that was indeed a terrible wind last night   went on the dame   it
rocked the bed till it waked me from my sleep  did it rouse thee also 
liebchen  

but hilda responded neither to word nor look  she had left her wheel 
had crossed the room  and now stood gazing from the window to where
across the valley the green obelisk of the old fir had risen  men were
moving about the spot where once it stood  and the ring of axes on the
frosty air told that already the frugal peasantry were at work  and the
pride of the village  confidant of many secrets  was in process of
reduction to the level of vulgar fire wood 

in rushed two children   hast thou heard the news   they cried   the
lovers  tree is blown down  all the people are up there chopping  may we
go too  and see them chop  we will bring home all the cones to build the
christmas fire  ah  do let us go  mother  fir cones blaze so
magnificently  

 you are such little ones  you will get in the way of the axes and be
hurt   replied their mother  fondling them 

but the farmer said   

 yes  let them go  we will all go  get thy cloak  ursula  and thy
woollen hood  we will see the old tree once more before it is carried
away  wilt thou come too  hilda  

but hilda shook her head  and did not turn or answer  the children
rioted about  searching for baskets and fagot strings  but she neither
moved nor spoke  then the door closed  and all was quiet in the cottage 
but still hilda stood in the window  looking with dreamy  unseeing eyes
across the valley to the opposite hillside 

she was looking upon a picture   a picture which nobody would ever see
again  upon the venerable tree  beloved of all brelau  which for more
years than men could count  had stood there watching the tide of human
life ebb and flow  as some majestic old man might stand with children
playing about his kindly knees  whole generations of lovers had held
tryst under its shade  kisses had been interchanged  vows murmured   the
old  old story of human love  of human joy  of hope  of longing  of
trust  had been repeated and repeated there  age after age  and still
the old tree guarded its secrets well  as in days of greenest youth  and
still bent to listen like a half human friend  white arms clasped its
trunk  soft cheeks were laid there  as if the rough bark could feel
responsive thrill  two centuries of loving and listening had mellowed
its heart  the boughs seemed to whisper meanings to those who sought
their shade   gay songs to the young  counsels to the burdened 
benedictions to those who  bowed down with trouble  came  black clad and
sorrowful  to look across the valley where once the purple lights of
hope had met their eyes   wait   the rustling murmur seemed to say to
such   only wait  wait  as i have waited  and you shall be made
exceedingly glad  behold  the day dawns and the shadows fly away   and
though the heavy heart might not comprehend the whispered words 
something seemed lifted from the weight of sadness  and the mourners
departed comforted  knowing not why 

but not upon a vague picture only did hilda look  german girls can keep
their own counsel as well as girls of other nations  and for all her
father s joking she had not  lost her chance  under the lovers  tree 
often had she sat there  sat there not alone  and now in thought she was
there again  she heard a voice  she leaned to meet a kiss   wilhelm  
she faltered  and then the vision dissolved in a mist of hot and rushing
tears  in the old fir she seemed to lose a friend  an intercessor  oh 
why had this unhappy quarrel arisen  why had she and wilhelm loved at
all  if only to be so unhappy in the end 

but  in truth  it is very easy for lovers to quarrel  like particles of
electric matter  the two natures near  attract  repel  the fire that
leaps from either soul  responsive to kindred fire  fuses or destroys  a
hint  a suspicion  jealousy  mistrust  the thousand and one small
chances of life  come between  and all is over  only  

     the little pitted speck in garnered fruit 

is needful  a trifle  or what seemed a trifle  had been the beginning of
mischief between hilda and wilhelm  but the breach had slowly widened
till now  when for weeks they had neither met nor spoken  and the idyl
begun under summer boughs was withering in time of frost like summer
flowers 

to the old tree  and to him alone  did the girl confide her
wretchedness  in his dumb ear she owned herself in the wrong   why do
you not say so   the responsive murmur seemed to breathe   wilhelm is
true  wilhelm is kind  only a word  and all will be well   but pride
laid his finger on her lips  she neglected the kindly monitor  the word
came not  and now the dear old fir was gone  and thinking of all these
things  hilda s heart was very sad 

meantime upon the hillside a great crowd of people were assembled about
the fallen trunk  old men and women  with wistful eyes  stood there 
comely middle aged pairs  surrounded by children  young girls and their
bachelors  boys with fresh rosy faces and wondering eyes   all alike had
come to see once more the face of the village friend  merrily rang the
axes upon the wood  some looked sad  some merry  as the work went on 
there was much interchange of  do you remembers   much laughing and
joking  a few tears  the children with their baskets ran about picking
up the bright cones which once hung like a coronet upon the forehead of
the fir  here and there a woman stooped for a chip or a small twig to
carry away as relic  and then it began to grow dark  the people
recollected themselves  as people will after doing a sentimental thing 
and saw that it was time to go home  so in contented crowds they
descended the hill to their suppers  and threw billets of the old fir on
the fire  and beside the blaze partook of sausage and cheese  and
laughed and gossiped no less merrily than usual  and the funeral of the
old tree was over 

 we will keep all our cones  and the big fagot which fritz tied up 
until day after to morrow   said little gretchen   because  you know 
day after to morrow comes christmas eve  and the christ child must be
sure to find a good fire  

no one gainsaid this  so the fagot was laid aside 

all next day  and the next  did hilda labor busily  throwing herself
with feverish energy into the christmas preparations  there was a plenty
to do  the furniture must shine its brightest  veal and puddings must be
made ready for spit and oven  green boughs be hung everywhere  and 
above all  the tree must be prepared  hard and continually she worked 
and as the sun set on the blessed eve all was in order  a vast fire
crackled on the hearth of the  big room   thrown open in honor of the
festival  its bright blaze was reflected back from the polished panels
of the tall corner clock  and danced on the rosy apples and glossy
filberts of the still unlighted tree  which stood  green and
magnificent  beyond  little fruit of value did this wonderful tree bear 
jackets  stockings  leather shoes  loaded the lower boughs  above was a
flowering of warm hoods and gay neck cloths  there was a wooden cow for
gretchen  a trumpet of red tin for little paul  but the useful and the
necessary predominated  tender hands had arranged all  had hung the
many colored tapers  crowned the whole with bright berried stems  and 
in the moss at the foot  laid reverently a tiny straw cradle  with waxen
occupant  in memory of that resting place in the bethlehem manger where
once a  young child lay   and now  pale and tired  hilda stood gazing
upon her finished work 

 sister  sister   clamored eager voices through the closed door   hasn t
the christ child come yet  

 no  dears  not yet  go away and play quietly in the kitchen  i ll call
you when he comes  

the little footsteps retreated  and hilda seated herself before the fire
with a weary sigh  it would be an hour or more before her father would
return  and the lighting of the tree begin  so  leaning back in the high
carved chair  she gave herself up to rest of body  leaving her mind to
rove listlessly as it would 

the basket of cones stood beside the hearth  half mechanically she
stooped for a handful  and threw them on the blaze  then a certain
drowsy peace came over her  broken only by the flickering noise of the
burning cones  they did not burn like other cones  she thought  and even
as the idea floated through her brain  a strange  phantasmal change
passed over them  moving and blending  they began to build a picture in
the heart of the fire   the picture of a tree  drawn in flaming lines 
hilda knew the tree  it was the old fir of brelau  complete in limb and
trunk  and  as she gazed  figures formed themselves beneath the
boughs   figures as of people sitting there  which moved and
scintillated  and  swaying toward each other  seemed to clasp and kiss 
she uttered a low cry of pain  at the sound the scene shifted  the tree
dissolved as in fiery rain  and the cones  raising themselves and
climbing upward  stood ranged in a group on the topmost log  like a
choir of musicians about to play  strange notes seemed to come from the
blaze  low and humming  like a whispered prelude  then voices began to
speak  or to sing  which was it   in tones which sounded oddly near  and
yet infinitely far away  it was like a chorus of elves sung to the
accompaniment of rustling leaves  and all the time it went on  certain
brightly flaming cones  which took precedence  emphasized the music with
a succession of quick  glancing sparks  darting out like tiny
finger points  as if to attract attention 

 look at us  look at us   were the words of the strange _staccato_ chant
which sounded from the fire   we are all light and glorious as your love
used to be   used to be  it isn t so any longer   then other cones  half
burned and crusted over with white ashes  pushed forward and took up the
strain in sad recitative   look at us  look at us  hilda  we are as your
love is now   is now  ah  there will be worse to come ere long   and all
the time they sang  glowing strongly from within  they fixed what
seemed eyes  red and winking  on hilda s face  then the ashes from
below  drifting upward in an odd  aimless way  formed themselves into a
shadowy shape  and began to sing in low  muffled tones  full of sadness 
 we are dead  hilda   was their song   all dead  dead as your love will
be  will be  before long   and at the close of the strain all the cones
closed together  and emitted a sigh so profound and so melancholy that
hilda started from her chair  tears stood upon her cheeks  she stared at
the fire with strange excitement  it was burning quietly now  and
without noise  she was certainly awake  had she been dreaming 

just at that moment the latch of the door clicked slightly  and somebody
entered  slowly  hesitatingly  propelled from behind by a childish
figure   hilda   said gretchen s voice   here s wilhelm wanting to see
the father  i told him to come in  because _perhaps_ the father was
here  or else the mother   and gretchen s eyes explored the room in
search of the christ child  for a glimpse of whom she had resorted to
this transparent device  then  alarmed by hilda s stony silence  she
suddenly hung her head  and  rushing out  clapped the door behind her 
and left the two alone 

hilda gave a gasp of bewilderment  she could not move  was this part of
the vision  wilhelm stole one furtive glance at her face  then dropped
his eyes  for a moment perfect stillness prevailed  then  shifting
uneasily from one leg to the other in his embarrassment  the young man
muttered something undistinguishable  and turned  his hand was on the
door   a moment more and he would be gone  hilda started forward 

 wilhelm   she exclaimed  with the hoarse utterance of one who seeks to
escape from some frightful dream 

wilhelm turned  he saw the pale  agitated face  the eyes brimmed with
tears  the imploring  out stretched hands  another second and he held
her in his arms  the familiar touch melted the ice of hilda s heart  her
head sank upon his breast  and in a few broken words all was spoken and
explained 

so brief an interval and all life changed  the same intense feeling
which drove them asunder drew them as inevitably together now that once
the returning tides had chance to flow  clasped in close embrace  with
tears and smiles and loving self reproachings  they stood before the
fire  and as they bent for their first reconciled kiss  the fir cones 
flashing once more into life and activity  rose upon the topmost log 
even the burned and blackened ones glowed with fresh fire  hand in hand 
as it were  they climbed into position  and leaped and capered side by
side as if merrily dancing  while little jubilant cracks and clicks and
sounds  as of small hands clapped for joy  accompanied the movement 
then suddenly the splendor faded  and sinking with one consent into
ashes  the cones sifted through the logs and vanished forever  their
mission accomplished  their work done 

with eyes of amazement the lovers gazed upon the spectacle to its close 
as the last spark faded  hilda laid her head again on wilhelm s breast 

 ah   she said  tenderly sighing   the dear old fir  he loved us well 
wilhelm  and that was his  good by   

perhaps it was 




a balsam pillow 


now that fir needles and hemlock needles have become recognized articles
of commerce  and every other shop boasts its row of fragrant cushions 
with their inevitable motto   give me of thy balm  o fir tree   i am
reminded of the first pillow of the sort that i ever saw  and of what it
meant to the girl who made it  i should like to tell you the little
story  simple as it is  it belongs to the time  eight or nine years
since  before pine pillows became popular  perhaps chateaubriand dorset
may be said  for once in her life  to have set a fashion 

yes  that was really her name  her mother met with it in a newspaper 
and  without the least idea as to whether it appertained to man or
woman  adopted it for her baby  the many syllables fascinated her  i
suppose  and there was  besides  that odd joy in a piece of extravagance
that costs nothing  which appeals to the thrifty new england nature 
and is one of its wholesome outlets and indulgences 

so the methodist elder baptized the child  chateaubriand aramintha  
making very queer work of the unfamiliar accents  and then  so far as
practical purposes are concerned  the name ceased to be  how can a busy
household  with milk to set  and milk to skim  and pans to scald  and
butter to make  and pigs to feed  find time for a name like that 
 baby   the little girl was called till she was well settled on her feet
and in the use of her little tongue  then she became  brie   and brie
dorset she remained to the end  few people recollected that she
possessed any other name  unless the marriage  birth  and death pages of
the family bible happened to be under discussion 

the dorsets  was one of those picturesque  lonely  outlying farms  past
which people drive in the summer  saying   how retired  how peaceful  
but past which almost no one drives in the winter  it stood  with its
environment of red barns and apple orchards  at the foot of a low
granite cliff whose top was crowned with a fir wood  and two enormous
elm trees met over its roof and made a checker work of light and shade
on its closely blinded front  no sign of life appeared to the city
people who drew their horses in to admire the situation  except 
perhaps  a hen scratching in the vegetable beds  or a lazy cat basking
on the doorstep  and they would drive on  unconscious that behind the
slats of the green blinds above a pair of eyes watched them go  and a
hungry young heart contrasted their lot with its own 

hungry  there never was anything like the starvation which goes on
sometimes in those shut up farmhouses  boys and girls feel it alike  but
the boys are less to be pitied  for they can usually devise means to get
away 

how could brie get away  she was the only child  her parents had not
married young  when she was nineteen  they seemed almost elderly people 
so badly does life on a bleak new england farm deal with human beings 
her mother  a frail little woman  grew year by year less fit for hard
labor  the farm was not productive  poverty  pinch  the inevitable
recurrence of the same things to be done day after day  month after
month  the same needs followed by the same fatigues   all these brie had
to bear  and all the while the child had that love and longing for the
beautiful which is part of the artist s equipment  and the deprivation
of which is keen suffering  sweet sights  sounds  smells   all these she
craved  and could get only in such measure as her daily work enabled her
to get them from that world of nature which is the satisfaction of eager
hearts to whom all other pleasures are denied 

the fir wood on the upper hill was the temple where she worshipped 
there she went with her bible on sunday afternoons  with her patching
and stocking mending on other days  there she dreamed her dreams and
prayed her prayers  and while there she was content  but all too soon
would come the sound of the horn blown from below  or a call from the
house   brie  brie  the men are coming to supper  make haste   and she
would be forced to hurry back to the workaday world 

harder times followed  when she was just twenty  her father fell from
his loaded hay wagon  and fractured his thigh  there was no cure for the
hurt  and after six months of hopeless tendance  he died  brie and her
mother were left together on the lonely farm  with the added burden of a
large bill for doctoring and medicines  which pressed like a heavy
weight on their honorable hearts 

the hired man  reuben hall  was well disposed and honest  but before mr 
dorset s death he had begun to talk of going to the west  and brie
foreboded that he might not be willing to stay with them  mrs  dorset 
broken down by nursing and sorrow  had become an invalid  unable to
assist save in the lightest ways  the burden was sore for one pair of
young shoulders to bear  brie kept up a brave face by day  but at night 
horrors of helplessness and apprehension seized her  the heavens seemed
as brass  against which her feeble prayers beat in vain  the future was
barred  as it were  with an impassable gate 

what could they do  sell the farm  that would take time  for no one in
particular wanted to buy it  if reuben would stand by them  they might
be able to fight it out for another year  and  what with butter and eggs
and the corn crop  make enough for his wages and a bare living  but
would reuben stay 

our virtues sometimes treat us as investments do  and return a dividend
when we least expect it  it was at this hard crisis that certain good
deeds of brie s in the past stood her friend  she had always been good
to reuben  and her sweet ways and consideration for his comfort had
gradually won a passage into his rather stolid affections  now  seeing
the emergency she was in  and the courage with which she met it  he
could not quite find the heart to  leave the little gal to make out by
herself   fully purposing to go  he stayed  putting off the idea of
departure from month to month  and though  true to his idea of proper
caution  he kept his good intentions to himself  so that the relief of
having him there was constantly tempered by the dread lest he might go
at any time  still it _was_ relief 

so april passed  and may and june  the crops were planted  the
vegetables in  brie strained every nerve  she petted her hens  and
coaxed every possible egg out of them  she studied the tastes of the two
cows  she maintained a brave show of cheer for her ailing mother  but
all the time she was sick at heart  everything seemed closing in  how
long could she keep it up 

the balsam firs of the hill grove could have told tales in those days 
they were brie s sole confidants  the consolation they gave  the counsel
they communicated  were mute  indeed  but none the less real to the
anxious girl who sat beneath them  or laid her cheek on their rough
stems  june passed  and with early july came the answer to brie s many
prayers  it came  as answers to prayer often do  in a shape of which she
had never dreamed 

miss mary morgan  teacher in grammar school no  3  ward nineteen  of the
good city of boston  came  tired out from her winter s work  to spend a
few days with farmer allen s wife  her second cousin  stopped one day at
the dorset s door  while driving  to ask for a drink of water  took a
fancy to the old house and to brie  and next day came over to propose
herself as a boarder for three months 

 i can only afford to pay seven dollars a week   she said   but  on the
other hand  i will try not to make much trouble  if you will take me  

 seven dollars a week  only think   cried brie  gleefully  to her mother
after the bargain was completed  and miss morgan gone   doesn t it seem
like a fortune  it ll pay reuben s wages  and leave ever so much over 
and she doesn t eat much meat  she says  and she likes baked potatoes
and cream and sweet baked apples better than anything  and there s the
keeping room chamber all cleaned and ready  doesn t it seem as if she
was sent to us  mother  

 your poor father never felt like keepin  boarders   said mrs  dorset 
 i used to kind of fancy the idea of it  but he wasn t willin   i
thought it would be company to have one in the house  if they was nice
folks  it does seem as if this was the lord s will for us  her coming in
so unexpected  and all  

two days later miss morgan  with a hammock and a folding canvas chair
and a trunk full of light reading  arrived  and took possession of her
new quarters  for the first week or two she did little but rest 
sleeping for hours at a time in the hammock swung beneath the shadowing
elms  then  as the color came back to her thin face and the light to her
eyes  she began to walk a little  to sit with brie in the fir grove  or
read aloud to her on the doorstep while she mended  shelled peas  or
picked over berries  and all life seemed to grow easier and pleasanter
for the dwellers in the solitary farmhouse  the guest gave little
trouble  she paid her weekly due punctually  and the steady income 
small as it was  made all the difference in the world to brie 

as the summer went by  and she grew at home with her new friend  she
found much relief in confiding to her the perplexities of her position 

 i see   miss morgan said   it is the winter that is the puzzle  i will
engage to come back next summer as i have this  and that will help
along  but the time between now and then is the difficulty  

 yes   replied brie   the winter is the puzzle  and reuben s money  we
have plenty of potatoes and corn and vegetables to take us through  and
there s the pig to kill  and the chickens will lay some  if only there
were any way in which i could make enough for reuben s wages  we could
manage  

 i must think it over   said miss morgan 

she pulled a long branch of the balsam fir nearer as she spoke  and
buried her nose in it  it was the first week of september  and she and
brie were sitting in the hill grove 

 i love this smell so   she said   it is delicious  it makes me dream  

brie broke off a bough 

 i shall hang it over your bed   she said   and you will smell it all
night  

so the fir bough hung upon the wall till it gradually yellowed  and the
needles began to drop 

 why  they are as sweet as ever   sweeter   declared brie  smelling a
handful which she had swept from the floor  then an idea came into her
head 

she gathered a great fagot of the branches  and laid them to dry in the
sun on the floor of a little used piazza  when partly dried  she
stripped off the needles  stuffed with them a square cotton bag  and
made for that a cover of soft sage green silk  with an odd shot pattern
over it  it was a piece of what had been her great grandmother s wedding
gown 

_voilà _ do you realize the situation  reader  brie had made the first
of all the many balsam pillows  it was meant for a good by gift to miss
morgan 

 your cushion is the joy of my life   wrote that lady to her a month
after she went home   every one who sees it  falls in love with it  half
a dozen people have asked me how they could get one like it  and  brie 
this has given me an idea  why should you not make them for sale  i will
send you up some pretty silk for the covers  and you might cross stitch
a little motto if you liked  i copy some for you  two people have given
me an order already  they will pay four dollars apiece if you like to
try  

this suggestion was the small wedge of the new industry  brie lost no
time in making the two pillows  grandmother s gown fortunately holding
out for their covers  then came some pretty red silk from miss morgan 
with yellow _filoselle_ for the mottoes  and more orders  brie worked
busily that winter  for her balsam pillows had to be made in spare
moments when other work permitted  the grove on the hill was her
unfailing treasury of supply  the thick set twigs bent them to her will 
the upper branches seemed to her to rustle as with satisfaction at the
aid they were giving  in the spring the old trees renewed their foliage
with vigorous purpose  as if resolved not to balk her in her purpose 

the fir grove paid reuben s wages that winter  miss morgan came back the
following june  and by that time balsam pillows were established as
articles of commerce  and brie had a munificent offer from a recently
established decorative art society for a supply of the needles  at
three dollars the pound  it was hard  dirty work to prepare such a
quantity  but she did not mind that 

as i said  this was some years since  brie no longer lives in her old
home  her mother died the third year after miss morgan came to them  the
farm is sold  and brie married  she lives now on a ranch in colorado 
but she has never forgotten the fir grove  and the memory of it is a
help often in the desponding moments that come at times to all lives 

 i could not be worse off than i was then   she says to herself   there
seemed no help or hope anywhere  i felt as if god didn t care and didn t
hear my prayers  and yet  all the time  there was dear miss morgan
coming to help us  and there were the trees  great beautiful things 
nodding their heads  and trying to show me what could be made out of
them  no  i never will be faithless again  nor let myself doubt  however
dark things may look  but remember my balsam pillows  and trust in
god  




colonel wheeler 


colonel wheeler  as any one might see at a glance  had been a gallant
officer in his day  it was true that he no longer had anything to do
with military movements  but his very face suggested a martial past  so
did his figure  which  though thin to an almost incredible degree  was
unmistakably that of a military man  and also his dress  for the colonel
invariably appeared in full uniform  with a scarlet  gold laced coat 
epaulettes  and a cocked hat and feathers  seldom removed even at
meal times  his moustache waved fiercely half way across his cheeks  his
eyes were piercing  and his eyebrows black and frowning  in short  it
would be difficult to imagine a more warlike appearance than he
presented on the most peaceful occasions 

like all truly brave men  colonel wheeler was as gentle as he was
valiant  and nothing pleased him better in the piping times of peace
than to be detailed on escort duty  and made of use to the ladies of his
acquaintance  so it came to pass that again and again he was asked to
take charge of large family parties on long journeys  you might see him
starting off with a wife or two  half a dozen sisters in law  and from
eight to fourteen children  all of them belonging to somebody else  not
one of them being kith or kin to the gallant colonel  they made really a
formidable assemblage when collected  and it took the longest legal
envelope which liz  

there  i have let out the secret  colonel wheeler was a paper doll  and
these ladies and children who travelled about with him were paper dolls
also  they belonged to lizzie bruce and her cousin ernestine  who
between them owned several whole families of such  these families were
all large  none of the mamma dolls had less than twelve children  and
some of them had as many as twenty  lizzie and ernestine despised people
not made of paper  who had only two or three little boys and girls  in
fact  lizzie was once heard to say of some neighbors with eleven
children   they are the only really satisfactory people i ever
knew   just as good as paper dolls   and this was meant as the highest
possible compliment 

lizzie lived in annapolis  md   and ernestine in hingham  mass   so  as
you will see  there was a long distance between their homes  it took a
day and a half to make the journey  and the little cousins did not visit
each other more than once or twice a year  but the dolls went much
oftener  _they_ travelled by mail  in one of those long yellow envelopes
which lawyers use to put papers in  and colonel wheeler always went in
the same envelope to take care of them  when they came back from these
trips  lizzie or ernestine  whichever it chanced to be  would unpack
them  and exclaim delightedly   how well the dear things look  so much
better for the change  see  mamma  how round and pink their faces have
grown  

 i wouldn t advise you to depend so much on colonel wheeler   lizzie s
mother would sometimes say   these military men are rather uncertain
characters  i wouldn t send off all the dolls at once with him  if i
were you  and really  lizzie  such constant journeys are very expensive 
there is never a stamp in my desk when i want one in a hurry  

 but  mamma  the children really _had_ to have a change   lizzie would
protest  with tears in her eyes   and as for the colonel  he is such a
good man  truly  mamma  he would never steal anybody else s family  he
takes beau tiful care of the dolls  always  

 very well  we shall see   answered mamma  with a teazing smile  but she
saw that lizzie was in earnest  so she did not say anything more to
trouble her  and the very next day contributed seven postage stamps to
pay for the transportation of a large party which lizzie wanted to send
on to hingham for a christmas visit 

this party included  besides colonel wheeler  who as usual acted as
escort  mrs  allen  the wife of captain allen  her fourteen children 
her sister in law miss allen  her own sister pauline gray   so called
because her only dress happened to be made of gray and blue
tissue paper   and mrs  adipose and her little girl  mrs  adipose  whose
name had been suggested by papa  was the fattest of all the dolls  her
daughter was fat  too  and ernestine had increased this effect by making
her a jacket so much too large for her that it could only be kept on
with a dab of glue  captain allen was a creature who had no real
existence  lizzie meant to make a doll to represent him some day 
meanwhile  he was kept persistently  at the front   wherever that might
be  and mrs  allen travelled about as freely as if she had no husband at
all  this lizzie and ernestine considered an admirable arrangement  for 
as captain allen never came home and never wrote  he was as little of an
inconvenience to his family as any gentleman can ever hope to be 

well  this large and mixed company started off gayly in the mail bag 
and in due time lizzie heard of their safe arrival  that they were all
well  and that the baby  already looked better for the change   about
three weeks later another letter came  and she opened it without the
least qualm of anxiety  or any suspicion of the dreadful news it was to
bring  it ran thus   

    dear liz   mrs  adipose grew a little home sick  she began to
    worry about mr  adipose  she was afraid he would have trouble
    with the servants  or else try to clean house while she was
    away  and make an awful mess all over everything  you never
    could tell what men would do when they were left alone  she
    said  so  as i saw she wasn t enjoying herself any more  and as
    the baby and little ellen seemed to have got as much good out of
    the visit as they were likely to get  i sent them back last week
    friday  and hope you got them safely 

lizzie dropped the letter with a scream of dismay  this was saturday 
last week friday was more than a week ago  where  oh  where were the
precious dolls 

she flew with her tragic tale to mamma  who  for all she was very sorry 
could not help laughing 

 you know i warned you against trusting too much to colonel wheeler  
she said 

 oh  mamma  it isn t his fault  i am sure it isn t   pleaded lizzie   i
have perfect confidence in him  think how often he has gone to hingham 
and never once didn t come back  he _would_ have fetched them safely if
he hadn t been interfered with  i know he would  no  something dreadful
has happened   it s that horrid post office   and she wrung her hands 

mamma was very sorry for lizzie  papa wrote to the postmaster  and
ernestine s papa inquired at the hingham post office  and there was
quite a stir over the lost travellers 

time went on  a month  six weeks  two months passed  and no tidings
came  and mr  adipose still sat in the lonely baby house  watching the
cook brandishing a paper saucepan  always the same saucepan  over the
toy stove  and bridget  the  housemaid   forever dusting the same
table top  and never getting any farther on with her work  mamma
proposed that lizzie should make some new dolls to take the place of the
lost ones  and offered help and the use of her mucilage bottle  but
lizzie shook her head sorrowfully 

 i can t help feeling as if the allens may come back some day   she
said   colonel wheeler is such a good traveller  and what would they
think if there was a strange family in their rooms  besides  it s almost
as much fun to play without them  because there is mr  adipose  a
widower  you know  which is very interesting  and the two pairs of
twins  which mrs  allen forgot to take  besides  i can always make
believe that they are coming to morrow  

the very next morning after this conversation  as mamma sat writing in
her room upstairs  she heard a wild shriek at the front door  the
postman had rapped a moment before  and lizzie had rushed down to meet
him  as she had each day since the dolls were lost  the shriek was so
loud and sudden that mrs  bruce jumped up  but before she could get to
the door in flew lizzie  holding in her hand a wild huddle of battered
blue envelopes with  dead letter office  stamped on their corners  and a
mass of pink and gray and green gowns and funny tumbled capes and hats 
it was the doll party  returned at last 

 mamma  mamma   she cried   what did i tell you  colonel wheeler didn t
run away with them  he has brought them all home  

there they were indeed  mrs  adipose as fat as ever  mrs  allen  and all
her children  the sister  the sister in law  and colonel wheeler  erect
and dignified as usual  in spite of a green crease across both his legs 
and a morsel of postage stamp in his eye  and wearing an air of
conscious merit  which the occasion fully warranted  as lizzie
rapturously embraced him  she cried   dear old colonel  nobody believed
in you but me  not even mamma  i knew you hadn t run away with nineteen
people  mamma laughed at me  but she doesn t know you as well as i do 
nobody shall ever laugh at you again  

and nobody did  colonel wheeler had earned public confidence  and from
that day to this no one has dared to say a word against him in lizzie s
hearing  he has made several journeys to hingham without the least
misadventure  and papa says he would trust him to escort lizzie herself
if it were necessary  he is the hero of the dolls  home  and poor old
mr  adipose  who never stirs from home  is made miserable by having him
held up as a perpetual model for imitation  but unlike the generality of
heroes  colonel wheeler lives up to his reputation  and is not less
modest  useful  and agreeable in the domestic circle because of being so
exceptionally meritorious 




ninety three and ninety four 


ninety three and ninety four were two houses standing side by side in
the outskirts of a country town  and to all outward appearance as like
each other as two peas  they were the pioneer buildings of a small brick
block  but as yet the rest of the block had not been built  which was
all the better for ninety three and ninety four  and gave them more
space and outlook  both had french roofs with dormer windows  both front
doors  grained  to represent oak  the graining falling into a pattern of
regular stripes like a watered silk  and across the front of each  on
the ground floor  ran the same little sham balcony of varnished
iron   balconies on which nothing heavier than a cat could venture
without risk of bringing the frail structures down into the street 

inside  the houses differed in trifling respects  as houses must which
are under the control of differing minds  but in one point they were
precisely alike within   which was  that the back room of the third
story of each was occupied by a girl of seventeen 

it is of these two rooms that i want to tell the story  so much has been
said and written of late years about home decoration and the methods of
producing it  that i think some other girls of seventeen with rooms to
make pretty may like to hear of how eleanor pyne and may blodgett
managed theirs 

eleanor was the girl at ninety three  she and may were intimate friends 
or considered themselves such  intimacy is a word very freely used among
young people who have not learned what a sacred word it is and how very
much it means  they had grown up together  had gone to the same schools 
shared most of their pleasures as well as their lessons  sent each other
christmas presents and birthday cards every year  and consulted in
advance over their clothes  spring bonnets  and fancy work  which  taken
all together  may be said to make an intimacy according to the general
use of the term  so it was natural that  when may  stirred by the sense
of young ladyhood just at hand and by the modern impulse for house
decoration  desired to  do over  and beautify her room  eleanor should
desire it also 

making a room pretty nowadays would seem easy enough where there is
plenty of money for the purpose  there is only the embarrassment of
choice  though that is so embarrassing at times as to lead one to envy
those grandmothers of ours  who  with only three or four patterns of
everything to choose from  and those all ugly  had but the simple task
of selecting the least ugly  but in the case of my two girls there was
this further complication  that very little money could be used for
adornment of the bedrooms  mrs  blodgett and mrs  pyne had consulted
over the matter  and the decision was that eleanor and may might each
spend twenty dollars  and no more 

what can be done with twenty dollars  it will buy one pretty article of
furniture  it will pay for a  kensington art square   with perhaps
enough left for cheese cloth curtains  it will paper a room  or paint
it  you can easily dispose of the whole of it  if you will  in a single
portière  and here were two rooms which needed renovation from floor to
ceiling 

the rooms were of the same size  both had two windows looking north and
an ample closet  the most important difference lay in the fact that the
builder of the houses  for some reason known only to himself  had put a
small fireplace across the corner of eleanor s room  and had put none in
may s  _per contra_ may s room was papered  which she considered a
counterbalancing advantage  but as the paper was not very pretty 
eleanor did not agree with her 

many were the consultations held between the two girls  and just here 
before they had actually begun operations  a piece of good luck befell
both of them  eleanor s grandmother presented her with an easy chair  an
old one  very shabby as to cover  but a good chair still  and very
comfortable  and almost simultaneously a happily timed accident occurred
to mrs  blodgett s spare room carpet  which made the buying of a new one
necessary  and the old one was given to may  it was a still respectable
brussels  with rather a large medallion figure on a green ground  it did
not comport very well with the blue and drab paper on the walls  and the
medallions looked very big on the smaller floor  but may cared nothing
for that  and she accepted her windfall gleefully 

 it will save ever and ever so much   she said  joyously   carpets do
cost so  poor eleanor  you will have to get one for yourself  unless you
can persuade your cook to upset an oil lamp on one of your mother s  

 oh  annie is too careful  she could never be persuaded to do such a
thing as that   laughed eleanor   besides  i don t want her to  i don t
like any of mother s carpets very much  

 well  i don t care what sort of a carpet it is so long as i don t have
to buy it   said may 

 i do   replied eleanor 

she did  there was this great point of difference between the friends 
eleanor possessed by nature that eye for color and sense of effects
which belongs to what people call the  artistic  temperament  may had
none of this  and did not even understand what it meant  to her all reds
and olives and yellows were alike  differences of tone  inflections of
tint  were lost on her untrained and unappreciative vision  she was
unconscious of this deficiency  so it did not annoy her  and as eleanor
had a quiet and pleasant way of differing with her  they never
quarrelled  but none the less did each hold to her own point of view and
her own opinion 

so  while may read eagerly all the articles in the secular and religious
papers which show how girls and women have made plain homes cheaply
charming by painting sunflowers and black eyed susans on ink bottles and
molasses jugs  converting pork barrels into arm chairs with the aid of
 excelsior  and burlaps  and  lighting up  dark corners with six cent
fans  and was fired with an ambition to do the same  eleanor silently
dissented from her enthusiasms  she was ready to help  however  even
when she did not agree  and may  glad of the help  did not notice much
the lack of sympathy  it is often so in friendships  one does the
talking and one the listening  one kisses while the other holds out the
cheek  as the french proverb puts it  one lays down the law and the
other differs without disputing it  so both are satisfied 

it was so in this case  eleanor was doing a great deal of quiet thinking
and planning while may chattered by the hour over her projects 

 what i want my room to be   she told her friend   is gay and dressy  i
hate dull looking rooms  and having no carpet or paper to buy i can get
lots of chintz  there s a lovely pattern on the bargain counter at
shell s for fourteen cents  all over roses  i am going to have a whole
piece of it  and just cover up all that awful old yellow furniture of
mine entirely  the bureau is to have little rods across the front and
curtains to hide the drawers  like that picture in the  pomologist   and
i shall make a soapbox footstool and a barrel chair  and have
lambrequins and a drapery over my bed  and a coverlet and valances  the
washstand i have decided to do in burlaps with cat tails embroidered on
the front  and a splasher with a pattern of swans and   wash and be
clean   won t it be lovely 

 you know those black walnut book shelves of mine   she went on  after a
pause   well  i am going to cover them in white muslin with little
pleated ruffles on the edges and pink satin bows at the corners  sarah
stanton has promised to paint me a stone bottle with roses to put on
top  and bell short is working me a wall banner  it s going to be the
gayest little place you ever saw  

 won t the white muslin soil soon  and won t so much chintz get very
dusty   objected eleanor 

 oh  they can be washed   replied may  easily 

so the big roll of chintz was ordered home  and for a fortnight she and
eleanor spent all their spare time in hemming ruffles  tacking pleatings
on to wooden shelves  and putting up frills and curtains  when all was
done the room looked truly very fresh and gay  the old yellow  cottage
furniture  had vanished under its raiment of chintz and was quite
hidden  even the foot board of the bed had its slip cover and flounce 
the books were ranged in rows on the muslin shelves with crisp little
ruffles above and below  flowers and bright colored zig zags of crewels
adorned everything  wherever it was possible  a japanese fan was stuck
on the wall  or a bow of ribbon  or a little embroidered something  or a
christmas card  scarfs of one sort or another were looped across the
corners of the pictures  tidies innumerable adorned the chair backs and
table tops  there was a general look of fulness and of an irresistible
tendency in things to be of no particular use except to make spots of
meaningless color and keep the eye roving restlessly to and fro 

 isn t it just lovely   said may  as she stood in the doorway to take in
the effect   now  eleanor pyne  do say it s lovely  

 it s as bright as can be   answered eleanor  cordially   only i can t
bear to think of all these pretty things getting dusty  they re so nice
and fresh now  

 oh  they can easily be dusted   said may   you are a perfect crank
about dust  elly  now  here is my account  i think i have managed pretty
well  don t you  

the account ran thus   

    sixty yards of chintz at 14 cents a yard      8 40
    burlaps  cheese cloth  white muslin           3 25
    fans  ribbons  crewels                        1 60
    stamping a tidy                                 30
    one wicker work chair                         5 00
    hanging basket                                1 25
                                                      
    total                                        19 80

 there s twenty cents left over   explained may  as she finished reading
the items   that will just get a yellow ribbon to tie round the handle
of my clothes brush  eleanor  you ve been ever so good to help me so
much  when are you going to begin your room  you must let me help you
now  

 i began this morning  

 have you really begun  what did you get  

 oh  i didn t get anything  this first thing isn t to cost anything at
all  

 why  what is it  

 you know that ugly fire board in front of my fireplace  i have taken it
upstairs to the attic  and mother has lent me some cunning little
andirons and a shovel and tongs which grandmamma gave her  and i am
going to have an open fire  

 but you don t need one  the room is warm enough  with your register  

 oh  i know that  and i didn t mean that i was going to _light_ the
fire  only have it all ready for lighting  i rubbed the brass knobs
myself with puit s pomade  and they shine _beautifully_  and i painted
the bricks with red ochre and water  and arranged the wood and
kindlings  and it has such a cosy  homelike look  you can t think  

 well  i confess i don t see the cosiness of a fire that you re never
going to light  

 oh  mamma says if i ever am sick in bed  or there is any particular
reason for it  i may light it  and even if it doesn t happen often  i
shall have the comfort of knowing that it s all ready  

 i call it cold comfort  what a queer girl you are  well  what are you
going to do next  elly  

 you will laugh when i tell you  i m going to paper my room myself  

 not really  why  you can t  papering is very difficult  i have always
heard so  people have to get men to do it  always  

 i don t believe it s so very difficult  there was a piece about it once
in the  family friend  which i cut out and saved  it told how to make
the paste and everything  and it didn t seem hard at all  mother thinks
i can  i m going to begin to morrow  in fact  i began yesterday  for old
joyce came and mended the crack in the ceiling and kalsomined it  and
oh  may  i did such a _thrifty_ thing  he had a nice big brush and a
roller to smooth out the paper with  and don t you think  i made a
bargain with him to hire them out to me for three cents an hour  so i
sha n t have to buy any  

 didn t he laugh  

 yes  he laughed  and ned laughed too  but i don t care   let those
laugh who win    concluded eleanor  with a bright  confident smile 

 come in to morrow afternoon and see how i get on   she called out from
the door of ninety three 

may went at the appointed time  the papering was done  and for a
beginner very well done  though an expert might easily have found faulty
places here and there  the paper eleanor had chosen was of a soft  warm
yellow like pale sunshine  which seemed to neutralize the cold light of
the north windows  it looked plain when seen in shadow  but where the
light struck it revealed a pattern of graceful interlaced disks  and the
ceiling was tinted with a much lighter shade of the same yellow  a
chestnut picture rod separated wall and ceiling 

 putting the paper on myself saved _lots_   announced eleanor 
gleefully   it only cost fifteen cents a roll  so the whole room came to
exactly a dollar eighty  then i am to pay joyce eighteen cents for six
hours  use of his brush and roller  and mother isn t going to charge
anything for the flour for the paste  because i boiled it myself  i had
to get the picture moulding  though  and that was rather dear   nearly
two dollars  ned nailed it up for me  

 why didn t you have a paper border  it would not have cost nearly as
much  

 no  but i should have had to drive nails and tacks in every time i
wanted to hang up anything  and that would have spoiled the paper  and i
want that to last a long  long time  

 what are you going to do with your furniture   asked may  casting an
eye of disfavor at the articles in question  a so called  cottage  set 
enamelled  of a faded  shabby blue 

 i am going to paint them   replied eleanor  daringly 

 eleanor pyne  you can t  

but eleanor could and did  painting is by no means the recondite art
which some of its professors would have us suppose  eleanor avoided one
of the main difficulties of the craft  by buying her paint ready mixed
and qualified with  dryers   she chose a pretty tint of olive brown  ned
took her bedstead apart for her  and one by one she carried the
different articles to a little used attic  where  equipped in a
long sleeved apron and a pair of old cotton gloves to save her fingers 
she gradually coated each smoothly with the new paint  it took some
days to finish  for she did not work continuously  but when done she
felt rewarded for her pains  for the furniture not only looked new  but
was prettier than it had ever been before during the memory of man  her
brother ned was so pleased with her success  that he volunteered  if she
would pay for the  stuff   to make a broad pine shelf to nail over the
narrow shelf of her chimney piece  and some smaller ones above  cut
after a pretty design which he had seen in an agricultural magazine 
this handsome offer eleanor gladly accepted  and when the shelves were
done  she covered them with two coats of the same useful olive brown
paint 

there was still some paint left  and grown bold with practice and no
longer afraid of her big brush  eleanor essayed a bolder flight  she
first painted her doors and her window frames  then she attacked her
floor  and  leaving an ample square space in the middle  executed a
border two feet and a half wide all round it  in a pattern of long
diamonds done in two shades of olive  the darker being obtained by
mixing a little black with the original tint 

 you see i have to buy my own carpet   she explained to the astonished
and somewhat scandalized may   and with this border a little square one
will answer  instead of my having to get a great big thing for the whole
floor  

 but sha n t you hate to put your feet on bare boards  

 that s just what i sha n t do  don t you see that the bureau and
washstand and the bedstead and towel frame and all the rest fill up
nearly all the space i have left for a border  what s the use of buying
carpet for _them_ to stand on  

may shook her head  she was not capable of such original reasoning  in
her code the thing that generally had been always should be 

 well  it seems rather queer to me  and not very comfortable   she said 
 and i can t think why you painted those shelves over the mantel instead
of covering them with something   chintz  now  they would have looked
awfully pretty with pinked ruffles  you know  and long curtains to draw
across the front like that picture you saw in  home made happy   

 oh  i shouldn t have liked that at all  i should hate the idea of
calico curtains to a mantel piece  it would always seem as if they were
going to catch fire  

 but they _couldn t_  you don t have any fire   persisted may 

 no  but they would seem so  and i want my fire to look as if it could
be lighted at any minute  

eleanor s instinct was based on an  underlying principle   it is a
charming point in any fireplace to look as if it were constantly ready
for use  inflammable draperies  however pretty  militate against this
look  and so are a mistake in taste  especially in our changeful new
england climate  where  even in midsummer  a little blaze may at any
moment be desirable to cheer a dull day or warm a chilly evening 

but may herself was forced to admit that the room looked  comfortable 
when the square of pretty ingrain carpeting of a warm golden brown was
tacked into its place  and the furniture brought back from the attic and
arranged  things at once fell into harmonious relation with each other 
as in a well thought out room they should do  the creamy  bright paper
made a pleasant background  there was an air of cheerfulness even on
cloudy days  may could not understand the reason of this  or why on such
days her reds and pinks and drabs and greens and blues never seemed to
warm her out of dulness 

 i am sure my colors are a great deal brighter than yours   she would
say   i cannot imagine why they don t light up better  

eleanor did not try for many evanescent prettinesses  in fact  she could
not  even had she wished to do so  for her money was all spent  so  as
she told her mother  she contented herself with having secured things
that would wear  and a pretty color  she put short curtains of  scrim 
at her windows  and plain serviceable towels which could be often washed
on her bureau and table tops  the bureau was enlivened by a large 
square scarlet pincushion  the only bit of finery in which eleanor
indulged  amid the subdued tone of its surroundings it looked absolutely
brilliant  like the famous red wafer which the great turner stuck in the
foreground of his dim tinted landscape  and which immediately seemed to
take the color out of the bright pictures on either side 

later  when eleanor had learned to do the pretty mexican work  now in
fashion  she decorated some special towels for her table and bureau 
with lace like ends  and a pair of pillow covers  meanwhile  she bore
very well the knowledge that may and most of the other girls of their
set considered her room rather  plain and bare   it suited her own
fancy  and that satisfied her 

 i do like room to turn about in and not too many things  and not to
smell of dust   she told her mother 

here is eleanor s budget of expenses  to set against may s   

    wall paper  twelve rolls                                       1 80
    use of brush and roller                                          18
    kalsomining ceiling                                            1 75
    picture moulding                                               2 00
    two gallons of mixed paint  at  1 80 per gallon                3 60
    brush                                                            30

    chintz for chair cover put on by eleanor herself               1 75
    satin and ribbon for cushion                                   1 12
                                                                       
    total                                                         19 86

this was two years ago  if you could take a peep at the rival rooms in
ninety three and ninety four to day  you would find eleanor s looking
quite as pretty as when new  or prettier  for she has used it
carefully  and each year has added something to its equipments  as years
will  when a girl has once secured a good foundation for her room  her
friends are apt to make their gifts work in toward its further
beautification 

with may it is different  her room has lost the freshness which was its
one good point  the chintz has become creased and a little faded  the
muslin and scrim from repeated washings are no longer crisp  and look
limp and threadbare  all the ribbons and scarfs are shabby and tumbled 
while the green carpet and the blue wall  swear  as vigorously at each
other as they did at first  may sighs over it frequently  and wishes she
had tried for a more permanent effect  next time she will do better  she
avers  but next times are slow in coming where the family exchequer has
not the recuperative powers of fortunatus s purse 

the moral of this simple tale may be divided into three heads  i object
to morals myself as a wind up for stories  and i dare say most of you
who read this are no fonder of them than i am  still  a three headed
moral is such a novelty that it may be urged as an excuse  the three
heads are these   

1  when you have only a small sum to spend on renovations  choose those
that will last 

2  ingenuity and energy count for more than mere money can 

3  once make sure in a room of convenience  cheerfulness  and a good
color  and you can afford to wait for gimcracks  or  jamescracks   or
any of the thousand and one little duds which so many people consider
indispensable features of pleasantness  rooms have their anatomy as well
as human beings  there must be a good substructure of bones rightly
placed to underlie the bloom and sparkle in the one  and in like manner
for the other the laws of taste  which are immutable  should underlie
and support the evanescent and passing fancies and fashions of every
day 




the sorrows of felicia 


it was a pretty chamber  full of evidences of taste and loving care 
white curtains draped the windows and the looking glass  there was a
nice writing table  set where the light fell upon it exactly as it
should for convenience to the writer  there was a book shelf full of
gayly bound books  a pretty blue carpet  photographs on the faintly
tinted blue wall   somebody had evidently taken pains to make the room
charming  and just as evidently to make it charming for the use of a
girl  and there lay the girl on the sofa   felicia  or  in schoolroom
parlance  felie bliss  was she basking in the comfort and tastefulness
of her room  not at all  a volume of  in memoriam  was in her hand  her
face was profoundly long and dismal  she murmured mournful lines over to
herself  only pausing now and then to reach out her hand and fill a
tumbler from a big jug of lemonade which stood on a little table beside
her  felie always provided herself with lemonade when she retired to her
bedroom to enjoy the pleasures of woe for a season 

from the door  which was locked  sounded a chorus of knocks and
irreverent voices 

 sister  are you in there   demanded one 

 are you thinking about life  sister   asked another 

 have you got your sharp pointed scissors with you   cried the first
voice   oh  felie  felie  stay your rash hand  

 we like lemonade just as much as you   chimed in dimple  the youngest
of the four 

 let us in  we are very thirsty  and we long to comfort you   said voice
the second  with a stifled giggle 

felicia paid no attention whatever to these observations  only murmured
to herself   

     but what to her shall be the end 
       and what to me remains of good 
       to her perpetual maidenhood   

 who is  her    demanded that bad jenny through the door   if you mean
mrs  carrington  you are all wrong  may curtis says her engagement is
announced to mr  collins  

 oh  children  do go away   cried felie in a despairing tone 

     forgive these wild and wandering cries 
       confessions of a wasted youth 
       forgive them where they fail in truth 
     and in thy wisdom make me wise  

 hear her   said betty outside   she s having it very badly to day  i
wish i knew tennyson  i should like to tell him what i think of his
writing a horrid  melancholy  caterwauling book  and making the bliss
family miserable  felie  if you ve drunk up all your lemonade  you might
at least lend us the pitcher  

it was no use  felicia either did not  or would not  hear  so  with a
last thump on the panels of the long suffering door  the trio departed
in search of another pitcher 

if anybody had told felie bliss  at seventeen  that she really had not
a grief in the world worthy of the name  she would have resented it
deeply  she was a tall girl  whose bones and frame were meant for the
use of a large woman  when their owner should have arrived at all that
nature meant her to be  but who at this period of her life was almost
startlingly long and thin  she had  outgrown her strength   as people
say  which was felie s only excuse for the almost tragic enjoyment
which she took in mournful things  she was in fair health  and had
an excellent appetite  and a real school girl love for raisins 
stick cinnamon  sugar plums  and soda water  tastes which were
highly at variance with the rôle which she wished to play   that of a
sweetly resigned and long suffering being  whose hopes had faded from
earth  into the distant heaven toward which she was hastening  felie s
sweet tooth was quite a trial to her  but she struggled with it  and
resisted enjoyment as far as was possible with her naturally cheerful
disposition 

she was an interesting perplexity to her family  who were contented 
reasonable folk  of the sort which  happily for the world  is called
commonplace  to her younger sisters  especially  felicia was a
never failing and exciting conundrum  the answer to which they were
always guessing  but never could find out  for days together she would
be as cheerful as possible  full of fun and contrivance  and the life of
the house  then  all of a sudden  gloom would envelop her like a soft
fog  and she would retire to her room with  in memoriam   or some other
introspective volume  and the fat jug of lemonade  lock the door  and
just  drink and weep for hours together   as her sister jenny expressed
it  it was really unaccountable 

all her books were deeply scored with lines against the woful passages 
and such pencilled remarks as  alas   and  all too true   she sat in
church with a carefully arranged sad smile on her face  but this  as
unsuitable to her natural expression  was not always a success  felie
was much aggrieved one day at being told  by an indiscriminating friend 
that her face  seemed made to laugh   no one could imagine it anything
but bright   this  for a girl who was posing for  patience on a monument
smiling at grief   was rather a trial  but then the friend had never
seen her reading  king john   and murmuring   

     here i and sorrow sit   

with a long brown stick of cinnamon  in process of crunch  occupying the
other corner of her mouth  but perhaps the friend might have found even
this funny   there are such unfeeling people in the world 

felie s letters were rather dull reading  because she told so little of
what she had said or done  and hinted so liberally at her own aching
heart and thwarted hopes  but her correspondents  who were mostly jolly
school girls  knew her pretty well  and dismissed these jeremiads as 
 just felie s way  she does love to be miserable  you know  but nobody
is better fun than she when she doesn t think it her duty to be
unhappy  

felie didn t come down to tea on the evening of the day on which our
story opens  an afternoon of lemonade had dampened her appetite  but at
bedtime she stole out in her dressing gown and slippers  helped herself
to a handful of freshly baked cookies and a large green cucumber pickle 
and  by the aid of these refreshments  contrived to stave off the pangs
of hunger till next morning  when she appeared at breakfast cheerful and
smiling  with no sign upon her spirits of the eclipse of the day before 
her family made no allusion to that melancholy episode   they were used
to such   only mr  bliss asked  between two mouthfuls of toast   where
were you gadding to last night  child  i didn t hear you come home  

 i was not out  i didn t feel very  very bright  and went to bed early  

 oh    mr  bliss understood 

 he who makes truth unlovely commits high treason against virtue   says
an old writer  but he who simulates grief  and makes it ridiculous 
commits an almost equal crime against true feeling  felie had been
playing at sorrow where no sorrow was  that very day a real sorrow came 
and she woke up to find her world all changed into a reality of pain and
puzzle and bewilderment  which was very different from the fictitious
loss and the sham suffering which she had found so much to her mind 

she had no idea  as she watched her father and mother drive off that
afternoon  that anything terrible was about to happen  only the  seers 
of the scotch legends could see the shroud drawn up over the breast of
those who are  appointed to die  suddenly  the rest of us see nothing 
the horse which mr  bliss drove was badly broken  but he had often gone
out before and come back safely  it was only on this particular day that
the combination of circumstances occurred which made the risky horse
dangerous   the shriek of the railroad whistle  the sharp turn in the
road  the heap of stones  there was a runaway  an overset  and two hours
from the time when the youthful sisters  unexpectant of misfortune  had
watched their parents off  they were brought back  mr  bliss dead  mrs 
bliss with a broken arm  and injuries to the spine so severe that there
was little chance of her ever being able to leave her bed again  so much
can be done in one fatal moment 

it is at such dark  dark times that real character shows itself  felie s
little affectations  her morbid musings and fancies  fell from her like
some light  fantastic drapery  which is shrivelled in sudden heat  her
real self  hopeful  self reliant  optimistic  rose into action as soon
as the first paralyzing shock of pain was past  and she had taken in the
reality of this new and strange thing  all the cares of the house  the
management of affairs  the daily wear and tear of life  which has to be
borne by _some one_  fell upon her inexperienced hands  her mother was
too shaken and ill to be consulted  the younger girls instinctively
leaned on what they felt to be a strength superior to their own  it was
a heavy load for young shoulders  and felie was not yet eighteen 

she made mistakes of course   mistakes repented of with bitter crying
and urgent resolutions  she was often tried  often discouraged  things
did not smooth themselves easily  or the world go much out of its usual
course  because felie bliss was perplexed and in trouble  there were no
mornings to spare for tragedy  or tennyson  felie s eyeballs often
longed for the relief of a good fit of tears  that troublesome little
lump would come into her throat which is the price of tears resolutely
held back  but there was too much to do to allow of such a weakening
self indulgence  mother must be cared for  the house must be looked
after  people on business must be seen  the  children   as she called
her sisters  must not be suffered to be too sad  and then  again   in
memoriam   beautiful as it is  and full of sweet and true and tender
feeling  did not satisfy felie now as it had done when she was forced to
cultivate an artificial emotion outside of herself 

 if i had time and knew how to write poetry  i could say a great many
things that tennyson never thought of   she told jenny  one day  it is
so with all who suffer  no poet ever voiced the full and complete
expression of our own personal pain  there is always something
beyond   an individual pang recognized and understood only by ourselves 

so the years went on  as years do even when their wheels seem weighted
with lead  the first sharpness of their loss abated  they became used to
the sight of their father s empty chair  of his closed desk  they ceased
to listen for the sound of his step on the porch  his key in the door 
mrs  bliss gradually regained a more comfortable measure of health  but
she remained an invalid  the chief variation in her life being when she
was lifted from bed to sofa  and back again from sofa to bed  felie was
twenty four  and the younger ones were no longer children  though she
still called them so  even dimple wore long dresses  and had set up
something very like a lover  though felie sternly refused to have him
called so till dimple was older  felie was equally severe with dr 
ernest allen  on her own account   she was a great deal too busy to
think of such a thing   she declared  but dr  allen  who had faith in
time  simply declared that he  didn t mind waiting   and continued to
hang his hat on the hat tree in the bliss s entry three times a week 

indeed  looking at felicia bliss  now that she had rounded physically
and mentally into what she was meant to become  you would not wonder
that any man should be willing to wait a while in hope of winning such a
prize  a certain bright cheer and helpfulness was her charm   the room
grew pleasanter as soon as she came into it   dimple declared  certainly
dr  allen thought so  and as a man may willingly put off building a
house till he can afford to have one which fronts the sun  so he
considered it worth while to delay  for a few years  even  if need be 
and secure for life a daily shining which should make all life
pleasanter  he had never known felie in her morbid days  and she could
never make him quite believe her when she tried to tell of that past
phase of her girlhood 

 it is simply impossible  you must exaggerate  if you have not dreamed
it   he said 

 not a bit  ask dimple   ask any of them  

 i prefer to ask my own eyes  my own convictions   declared the lover 
 you are the most  wholesome  woman  through and through  that i ever
knew  a doctor argues from present indications to past conditions  i am
sure you are mistaken about yourself  if i can detect with the
stethoscope the spot in your lungs where five years back pneumonia left
a trace  surely i ought to be able to make out a similar spot in your
nervous temperament  the idea is opposed to all that you are  

 but not to all that i was  really and truly  dr  allen  i used to be
the most absurd girl in the world  if you could have seen me  

 but what cured you in this radical and surprising manner  

 well   said felie  demurely   i suppose the remedy was what you would
call homeopathic  i had revelled in a sort of imaginary sorrowfulness 
but when that dreadful time came  and i tasted real sorrow  i found that
it took all my strength to meet it  and i was glad enough of everything
bright and cheering that i could get at to help me through 

 i wonder if there are many girls in the world who are nursing imaginary
miseries as i used to do   she went on   if there are  i should like to
tell them how foolish it is  and how bad for them  but  dear me  there
are so many girls and one can t get at them  i suppose each must learn
the lesson for herself and fight her fight out somehow  and i hope they
will all get through safely  and learn  as i have  that happiness is the
most precious thing in the world  and that it is so  _so_ foolish not to
enjoy and make the most of it while we have it  because  you know 
_some_ day trouble must come to everybody  and it is such a pity to have
to look back and know that you have wasted a chance  




imprisoned 


the big house stood in the middle of a big open space  with wide lawns
about it shaded by cherry trees and lilac bushes  toward the south an
old fashioned garden  and back of that the apple orchard 

the little house was on the edge of the grounds  and had its front
entrance on the road  its doors were locked and its windows shuttered
now  for no one had lived in it for several years 

three little girls lived in the big house  lois  who was eight years
old  and emmy  who was seven  were sisters  kitty  their cousin  also
seven  had lived with them so long that she seemed like another sister 
there was  besides  marianne  the cook s baby  but as she was not quite
three  she did not count for much with the older ones  though they
sometimes condescended to play with her 

it was a place of endless pleasure to these happy country children  and
they needed no wider world than it afforded them  all summer long they
played in the open air  they built bowers in the feathery asparagus 
they knew every bird s nest in the syringa bushes and the thick
guelder roses  and were so busy all the time that they rarely found a
moment in which to quarrel 

one day in july their mother and father had occasion to leave home for a
long afternoon and evening 

 you can stay outdoors till half past six   mrs  spenser said to her
little girls   then you must come in to tea  and at half past seven you
must go to bed as usual  you may play where you like in the grounds  but
you must not go outside the gate   she kissed them for good by 
 remember to be good   she said  then she got into the carriage and
drove away 

the children were very good for several hours  they played that little
marianne was their baby  and was carried off by a gypsy  lois was the
gypsy  and the chase and recapture of the stolen child made an exciting
game 

at last they got tired of this  and the question arose   what shall we
do next  

 i wish mother would let us play down the road   said emmy   the noyse
children s mother lets them  

 i ll tell you what we ll do   said lois  struck by a sudden bright
idea   let s go down to the shut up house  that isn t outside the gate  

 o lois  yes  it is  you can t go to the front door without walking on
the road  

 well  who said anything about the front door  i m going to look in at
the back windows  mother never said we mustn t do that  

still  it was with a sense of guilt that the three stole across the
lawn  and they kept in the shadow of the hedge  as if afraid some one
would see and call them back  little marianne  with her rag doll in her
arms  began to run after them 

 there s that little plague tagging us   said kitty 

 go back  marianne  we don t want you   then  when marianne would not go
back  they all ran away  and left her crying 

the shut up house looked dull and ghostly enough  the front was in deep
shadow from the tall row of elms that bordered the road  but at the
back the sun shone hotly  it glowed through the low  dusty window of a
cellar  and danced and gleamed on something bright which lay on the
floor within 

 what do you suppose it is   said emmy  as they all stooped to look   it
looks like real gold  perhaps some pirates hid it there  and no one has
come since but us  

 or perhaps it s a mine   cried lois    a mine of jewels  see  it s all
purple  like the stones in mother s breastpin  wouldn t it be fun if it
was  we wouldn t tell anybody  and we could buy such splendid things  

 we must get in and find out   added kitty 

just then a wail sounded close at hand  and a very woful  tear stained
little figure appeared  it was marianne  the poor baby had trotted all
the long distance in the sun after her unkind playfellows 

 oh  dear  you little nuisance  what made you come   demanded emmy 

 i  ant to   was all marianne s explanation 

 well  don t cry  now you ve come  you can play   remarked lois  and
marianne was consoled 

they began to try the windows in turn  and at last found one in a
wood shed which was unfastened  kitty scrambled in  and admitted the
others  first into the wood shed and then into a very dusty kitchen  the
cellar stairs opened from this  they all ran down  but  oh 
disappointment   the jewel mine proved to be only the half of a broken
teacup with a pattern on it in gold and lilac  this was a terrible
come down from a pirate treasure 

 pshaw   said kitty   only an old piece of crockery  i don t think it s
fair to cheat like that  

little marianne had been afraid to venture down into the cellar  and now
stayed at the top waiting for them 

 let s run away from her   suggested kitty  who was cross after her
disappointment 

so they all hopped over marianne  and  deaf to her cries  ran upstairs
to the second story as fast as they could go  there were four bare 
dusty chambers  all unfurnished 

 there she comes   cried kitty  as marianne was heard climbing the
stairs   where shall we hide from her  oh  here s a place  

she had spied a closet door  fastened with a large old fashioned iron
latch  she flew across the room  it was a narrow closet  with a shelf
across the top of it 

 hurry  hurry   called kitty  the others made haste  they squeezed
themselves into the closet  and banged the door to behind them  not till
it was firmly fastened did they notice that there was no latch inside 
or handle of any sort  and that they had shut themselves in  and had no
possible way of getting out again 

their desire to escape from marianne changed at once into dismay  they
kicked and pounded  but the stout old fashioned door did not yield 
marianne could be heard crying without  there was a round hole in the
door just above the latch  putting her eye to this  lois could see the
poor little thing  doll in arms  standing in the middle of the floor 
uncertain what to do 

 marianne   she called   here we are  in the closet  come and let us
out  that s a good baby  put your little hand up and push the latch  you
can  if you will only try  

 i ll show you how   added kitty  taking her turn at the peep hole 
 see  come close to the door  and kitty will tell you what to do  

but these mysterious voices speaking out of the unseen frightened
marianne too much to allow of her doing anything helpful 

 i tan t  i tan t   she wailed  not venturing near the door 

 oh  do try  please do   pleaded lois   i ll give you my china doll if
you will  marianne  

 and i ll give you my doll s bedstead   added emmy   you d like that  i
know  dear little marianne  do try to let us out  please do  we re so
tired of this old closet  

but still marianne repeated   tan t  tan t   and at last she sat down on
the floor and wept  the imprisoned children wept with her 

 i ve thought of a plan   said emmy at last   if you ll break one of the
teeth out of your shell comb  lois  i think i can push it through the
hole and raise the latch up  

alas  the hole was above the latch  not below it  half the teeth were
broken out of lois s comb in their attempt  and with no result except
that they fell through the hole to the floor outside  at intervals they
renewed their banging and pounding on the door  but it only tired them
out  and did no good 

it was a very warm afternoon  and  as time went on  the closet became
unendurably hot  emmy sank down exhausted on the floor  and she and
kitty began to sob wildly  lois alone kept her calmness  little marianne
had grown wonderfully quiet  peeping through the hole  lois saw that she
had gone to sleep on the floor 

 don t cry so  kitty   she said   it s no use  we were naughty to come
here  i suppose we ve got to die in this closet  and it is my fault  we
shall starve to death pretty soon  and no one will know what has become
of us till somebody takes the house  and when they come to clean it and
they open the closet door  they will find our bones  

kitty screamed louder than ever at this terrible picture 

 oh  hush   said her cousin   the only thing we can do now is to pray 
god is the only person that can help us  mamma says he is close to every
person who prays  he can hear us if we are in the closet  

then lois made this little prayer   

 our father who art in heaven  we have been naughty  and came down here
when mamma didn t give us leave to come  but please forgive us  we won t
disobey again  if only thou wilt  we make a promise  help us  show us
the way to get out of this closet  don t let us die here  with no one to
know where we are  we ask it for jesus christ s sake  forever and
forever  amen  

it was a droll little prayer  but lois put all her heart into it  a
human listener might have smiled at the odd turn of the phrases  but god
knew what she meant  and he never turns away from real prayer  he
answered lois 

how did he answer her  did he send a strong angel to lift up the latch
of the door  he might have done that  you know  as he did for peter in
prison  but that was not the way he chose in this instance  what he did
was to put a thought into lois s mind 

she stood silent for a while after she had finished praying 

 children   she said   i have thought of something  kitty  you are the
lightest  do you think emmy and i could push you up on to the shelf  

it was not an easy thing to do  for the place was narrow  but at last 
with lois and emmy  boosting   and kitty scrambling  it was
accomplished 

 now  kitty  put your back against the wall   said lois   and when i say
 one  two  three   push the door with your feet as hard as you can 
while we push below  

kitty braced herself  and at the word  three   they all exerted their
utmost strength  one second more  and  oh  joy   the latch gave way  and
the door flew open  kitty tumbled from the shelf  the others fell
forward on the floor   they were out  lois had bumped her head  and
emmy s shoulder was bruised  but what was that  they were free 

 let us run  run   cried lois  catching marianne up in her arms   i
never want to see this horrible house again  

so they ran downstairs  and out through the wood shed into the open air 
oh  how sweet the sunshine looked  and the wind felt  after their fear
and danger 

their mother taught them a little verse next morning  after they had
told her all about their adventure and made confession of their fault 
and lois said it to herself every day all her life afterward  this is
it   

     god is never far away 
     god is listening all the day 
     when we tremble  when we fear 
     the dear lord is quick to hear   
     quick to hear  and quick to save 
       quick to grant each prayer we make 
     for the precious gift he gave 
       for his son our saviour s sake  

 i love that hymn   lois used to say   and i know it s true  because god
heard us just as well in that little bit of a closet as if we had been
in church  




a child of the sea folk 


the great storm of 1430 had done its worst  for days the tempest had
raged on land and sea  and when at last the sun struggled through the
clouds  broken now and flying in angry masses before the strong sea
wind  his beams revealed a scene of desolation 

all along the coast of friesland the dikes were down  and the salt water
washing over what but a few days before had been vegetable gardens and
fertile fields  the farm houses on the higher ground stood each on its
own little island as it were  with shallow waves breaking against the
walls of barns and stoned sheepfolds lower down on the slopes  already
busy hands were at work repairing the dykes  men in boats were wading up
to their knees in mud and water  men  swimming their horses across the
deeper pools  were carrying materials and urging on the work  but many
days must pass before the damage could be made good  and meanwhile  how
were people to manage for food and firing  with the peat stacks under
water  and the cabbages and potatoes spoiled by the wet 

 there is just this one thing   said metje huyt to her sister
jacqueline   little karen shall have her cup of warm milk to night if
everybody else goes without supper  on that i am determined  

 that will be good  but how canst thou manage it   asked jacqueline  a
gentle  placid girl of sixteen  with a rosy face and a plait of thick 
fair hair hanging down to her waist  metje was a year younger  but she
ruled her elder sister with a rod of iron by virtue of her superior
activity and vivacity of mind 

 i shall manage it in this way   i shall milk the electoral princess  

 but she is drowned   objected jacqueline  opening wide a pair of
surprised blue eyes 

 drowned  not at all  she is on that little hump of land over there
which looks like an island  but is really neighbor livard s high
clover patch  i mean to row out and milk her  and thou shalt go with
me  

 art thou sure that it is the electoral princess  and not any other
cow   asked jacqueline 

 sure  have i not a pair of eyes in my head  sure  don t i know the
twist of our own cow s horns  oh  jacque  jacque   what were thy blue
saucers given thee for  thee never seemest to use them to purpose 
however  come along  karen must not want for her milk any longer  the
mother was making some gruel water for her when i came away  and karen
did not like it  and was crying  

some wading was necessary to reach the row boat  which fortunately had
been dragged up to the great barn for repairs before the storm began 
and so had escaped the fate which had befallen most of the other boats
in the neighborhood   of being swept out to sea in the reflux of the
first furious tide  the barn was surrounded by water now  but it was
nowhere more than two or three inches deep  and pulling off their wooden
shoes  the sisters splashed through it with merry laughter  like most
friesland maidens  they were expert with the oar  and  though the waves
were still rough  they made their way without trouble to the wet green
slope where the electoral princess was grazing  raising her head from
time to time to utter a long melancholy moo of protest at the long delay
of her milkers  very glad was she to see the girls  and she rubbed her
head contentedly against jacqueline s shoulder while metje  with gentle 
skilful fingers  filled the pail with foaming milk 

 now stay quietly and go on eating friend livard s clover  since no
better may be   she said  patting the cow s red side   the water is
going down  the dikes are rebuilding  presently we will come and take
thee back to the home field  meanwhile each day jacque and i will row
out and milk thee  so be a good cow and stay contentedly where thou
art  

 what can that be   jacqueline asked after the sisters had proceeded a
short distance on their homeward way 

 what  

 that thing over there   and she pointed toward a distant pool some
quarter of a mile from them and still nearer to the sea   it looks
like  like  oh  metje  do you think it can be some one who has been
drowned  

 no   for it moves   it lifts its arm   said metje  shading her eyes
from the level rays of the sun  and looking steadily seaward 

 it is a girl  she is caught by the tide in the pool  row  jacqueline 
row  the tide turns in half an hour  and then she will be drowned
indeed  the water was very deep out there last night when the flood was
full  i heard voorst say so  

the heavy boat flew forward  for the sisters bent to the oars with all
their strength  jacqueline turned her head from time to time  to judge
of their direction and the distance 

 it s no neighbor   she answered as they drew nearer   it s no one i
ever saw before  metje  it is the strangest looking maiden you ever saw 
her hair is long   so long  and her face is wild to look upon  i am
afraid  

 never mind her hair  we must save her  however long it is   gasped
metje  breathless from the energy of her exertions   steady  now 
jacque  here we are  hold the boat by the reeds  girl  i say  girl  do
you hear me  we are come to help you  

the girl  for a girl it was who half sat  half floated in the pool 
raised herself out of the water as one alive  and stared at the sisters
without speaking  she was indeed a wild and strange looking creature 
quite different from any one that they had ever seen before 

 well  are you not going to get into the boat   cried metje   are you
deaf  maiden  that you do not answer me  you ll be drowned presently 
though you swam like forty fishes  for the tide will be coming in like
fury through yon breach in the dike  here  let me help you  give me your
hand  

the strange girl did not reply  but she seemed to understand a part  at
least  of what was said to her  she moaned  her face contracted as if
with pain  and  raising herself still farther from the water with an
effort  she indicated by signs that she was caught in the mud at the
bottom of the pool and could not set herself free 

this was a serious situation  for  as metje well knew  the mud was deep
and adhesive  she sat a moment in thought  then she took her oar  forced
the boat still nearer  and  directing jacqueline to throw her weight on
the farther edge to avoid an upset  she grasped the cold hands which the
stranger held out  and  exerting her full strength  drew her from the
mud and over the side of the boat  it rocked fearfully under her
weight  the milk splashed from the pail  but the danger was over in half
a minute  and the rescued girl  exhausted and half dead  lay safely on
the bottom 

 dear me  she will freeze   cried jacqueline hastily  for the poor thing
they had saved was without clothing  save for the long hair which hung
about her like a mantle   here  metje  i can spare my cloak to wrap
round her limbs  and she must put on thy jacket  we will row the harder
to keep ourselves warm  

rowing hard was indeed needful  for  summer as it was  the wind  as the
sun sank  blew in icy gusts from the zetland zee  whirling the sailless
windmills rapidly round  and sending showers of salt spray over the
walls of the sheepfolds and other outlying enclosures  the sisters were
thoroughly chilled before they had pulled the boat up to a place of
safety and helped the half drowned stranger across the wet slope of
grass to the house door 

their mother was looking out for them 

 where hast thou been  children   she asked   ach   with a look of
satisfaction as metje slipped the handle of the milk pail between her
fingers   that is well  little karen was wearying for her supper  but
who hast thou here   looking curiously at the odd figure whom her
daughters were supporting 

 oh  mother  it is a poor thing that we saved from drowning in that pool
over there   explained metje  pointing seaward   she is a stranger  from
far away it must be  for she understands not our speech  and answers
nothing when we ask her questions  

 dear me  what should bring a stranger here at this stormy time  but
whoever she is  she must needs be warmed and fed   and the good vrow
hurried them all indoors  where a carefully economized fire of peats was
burning  the main stock of peats was under water still  and it behooved
them to be careful of what remained  the father had said 

 we shall have to lend her some clothes   said metje in an embarrassed
tone   hers must have been lost in the water somehow  

 perhaps she went in to bathe  and the tide carried them away  
suggested jacqueline 

 bathe  in a tempest such as there has not been in my time  bathe  thou
art crazed  child  it is singular  most singular  i don t like it  
muttered the puzzled mother   well  what needs be must be  go and fetch
thy old stuff petticoat  metje  and one of my homespun shifts  and
there s that old red jacket of jacqueline s  she must have that  i
suppose  make haste  before the father comes in  

it was easier to fetch the clothes than to persuade the strange girl to
put them on  she moaned  she resisted  she was as awkward and ill at
ease as though she had never worn anything of the sort before  now that
they scanned her more closely there seemed something very unusual about
her make  her arms hung down   like flippers  metje whispered to her
sister  she stumbled when she tried to walk alone  it seemed as though
her feet  which looked only half developed  could scarcely support her
weight 

for all that  when she was dressed  with her long hair dried  braided 
and bound with a scarlet ribbon  there was something appealing and
attractive in the poor child s face  she seemed to like the fire  and
cowered close to it  when milk was offered her  she drank with avidity 
but she would not touch the slice of black bread which metje brought 
and instead caught up a raw shell fish from a pail full which voorst
had scooped out of the pool of sea water which covered what had been the
cabbage bed  and ate it greedily  the mother looked grave as she watched
her  and was troubled in her mind 

 she seems scarce human   she whispered to metje  drawing her to a
distant corner  though indeed they might have spoken aloud with no fear
of being understood by the stranger  who evidently knew no dutch   she
is like no maiden that ever i saw  

 perhaps she is english   suggested metje  who had never seen any one
from england  but had vaguely heard that it was an odd country quite
different from friesland 

the mother shook her head   she is not english  i have seen one english
that time that thy father and i went to haarlem about thy grand uncle s
inheritance  it was a woman  and she was not at all like this girl 
metje  but that thou wouldst laugh  and father pettrie might reprove me
for vain imaginations  i should guess her to be one of those mermaidens
of whom our forefathers have told us  there are such creatures   my
mother s great aunt saw one with her own eyes  and wrote it down  and
my mother kept the paper  often have i read it over  it was off the
texel  

 could she really be that  why  it would be better  more interesting  i
mean  than to have her an englishwoman   cried metje   we would teach
her to spin  to knit  she should go with us to church and learn the ave 
would it not be a good and holy work  mother  to save the soul of a poor
wild thing from the waves where they know not how to pray  

 perhaps   replied the vrow  doubtfully  she could not quite accustom
herself to her own suggestion  yet could not quite dismiss it from her
mind 

the father and voorst now came in  and supper  delayed till after its
usual time by the pressing needs of the stranger  must be got ready in
haste 

metje fell to slicing the black loaf  jacqueline stirred the porridge 
while the mother herself presided over the pot of cabbage soup which had
been stewing over the fire since early morning  voorst  meanwhile 
having nothing to do but to wait  sat and looked furtively at the
strange girl  she did not seem to notice him  but remained motionless in
the chimney corner  only now and then giving a startled sudden glance
about the room  like some wild creature caught in a trap  voorst thought
he had never seen anything so plaintive as her large  frightened eyes 
or so wonderful as the thick plait of hair which  as she sat  lay on the
ground  and was of the strangest pale color  like flax on which a
greenish reflection is accidentally thrown  it was no more like metje s
ruddy locks  or the warm fairness of jacqueline s braids  than moonlight
is like dairy butter  he said to himself 

supper ready  metje took the girl s hand and led her to the table  she
submitted to be placed on a wooden stool  and looked curiously at the
bowl of steaming broth which was set before her  but she made no attempt
to eat it  and seemed not to know the use of her spoon  metje tried to
show her how to hold it  but she only moaned restlessly  and  as soon as
the family moved after the father had pronounced the latin grace which
father pettrie taught all his flock to employ  she slipped from her seat
and stumbled awkwardly across the floor toward the fire  which seemed to
have a fascination for her 

 poor thing  she seems unlearnt in christian ways   said goodman huyt 
but later  when his wife confided to him her notion as to the
stranger s uncanny origin  he looked perplexed  crossed himself  and
said he would speak to the priest in the morning  it was no time for
fetching heathen folk into homes  he remarked  still less those who were
more fish than folk  as for mermaids  if such things there might be 
they were no better in his opinion than dolphins or mackerel  and he did
not care to countenance them 

father pettrie was duly consulted  he scouted the mermaid theory  and 
as the vrow had foreboded  gave her a reprimand for putting such ideas
into the mind of her family 

the girl was evidently a foreigner from some far distant country  he
said  a turk it might be  or a daughter of that people  descended from
ishmael  who held rule in the land of the holy sepulchre  all the more
it became a duty to teach her christian ways and bring her into the true
fold  and he bade goodman huyt to keep her till such time as her friends
should be found  to treat her kindly  and make sure that she was brought
regularly to church and taught religion and her duty 

there was no need of this admonition as to kindness  vrow huyt could
hardly have used a stray dog less than tenderly  and for jacqueline and
metje  they looked upon the girl as their own special property  and were
only in danger of spoiling her with over indulgence   ebba   they called
her  as they knew no name by which to address her  and in course of time
she learned to recognize it as hers and to answer to it   answer by
looks and signs  that is  for she never learned to speak  or to make
other sound than inarticulate moans and murmurs  except a wild sort of
laughter  and now and then  when pleased and contented  a low humming
noise like an undeveloped song  from these the family could guess at her
mood  from her expressive looks and gestures they made shift to
understand her wishes  and she  in turn  comprehended their meaning half
by observation  half by instinct  but closer communication was not
possible  and the lack of a common speech was a barrier between them
which neither she nor they could overcome 

gradually  dumb ebba   as the neighbors called her  was taught some of
the thrifty household arts in which dame huyt excelled  she learned to
spin  and though less expertly  to knit  and could be trusted to stir
whatever was set upon the fire to cook  and not let it burn or boil
over  when the family went to mass  she went too  limping along with
painful slowness on her badly formed feet  and she bowed her head and
knelt with the rest  but how much or how little she understood they
could not tell  except on sundays she never left the house  her first
attempts at doing so were checked by metje  who could not dismiss from
her memory what her mother had said  and was afraid to let her charge so
much as look toward the tempting blue waves which shone in the distance 
and after a while ebba seemed to realize that she was  so to speak  a
kindly treated captive  and resigned herself to captivity  little karen
was the only creature whom she played with  sometimes when busied with
the child she was noticed to smile  but for every one else her face
remained pitifully sad  and she never lost the look of a wild 
imprisoned thing 

so two years passed  and still dumb ebba remained  unclaimed by friends
or kindred  one of the friendly huyt household  the dikes were long
since rebuilt  the electoral princess had come back to her own
pasture ground and fed there contentedly in company with two of her own
calves  but the poor sea stray whom metje had pulled into the boat that
stormy night remained speechless  inscrutable  a mystery and a
perplexity to her adopted family 

but now a fresh interest arose to rival ebba s claims on their
attention  a wooer came for pretty jacqueline  it was young hans polder 
son of a thrifty miller in the neighborhood  and himself owner of one of
the best windmills in that part of friesland  jacqueline was not hard to
win  the wedding day was set  and she  metje  and the mother were busy
from morning till night in making ready the store of household linen
which was the marriage portion of all well to do brides  ebba s services
with the wheel were also put into requisition  and part of her spinning 
woven into towels  which  after a fancy of metje s  had a pattern of
little fish all over them  were known for generations as  the mermaid s
towels   but this is running far in advance of my story 

amid this press of occupation ebba was necessarily left to herself more
than formerly  and some dormant sense of loneliness  perhaps  made her
turn to voorst as a friend  he had taken a fancy to her at the
first   the sort of fancy which a manly youth sometimes takes to a
helpless child   and had always treated her kindly  now she grew to
feel for him a degree of attachment which she showed for no one else  in
the evening  when tired after the day s fishing he sat half asleep by
the fire  she would crouch on the floor beside him  watching his every
movement  and perfectly content if  on waking  he threw her a word or
patted her hair carelessly  she sometimes neglected to fill the father s
glass or fetch his pipe  but never voorst s  and she heard his footsteps
coming up from the dike long before any one else in the house could
catch the slightest footfall 

the strict watch which the family had at first kept over their singular
inmate had gradually relaxed  and ebba was suffered to go in and out at
her will  she rarely ventured beyond the house enclosure  however  but
was fond of sitting on the low wall of the sheep fold and looking off at
the sea  which  now that the flood had subsided  was at a long distance
from the house  and at such moments her eyes looked larger  wilder  and
more wistful than ever 

as the time for the wedding drew near  voorst fell into the way of
absenting himself a good deal from home  there were errands to be done 
he said  but as these  errands  always took him over to the little
island of urk  where lived a certain pretty olla tronk  who was
jacqueline s great friend and her chosen bridesmaiden  the sisters
naturally teased him a good deal about them  ebba did not  of course 
understand these jokings  but she seemed to feel instinctively that
something was in the air  she grew restless  the old unhappy moan came
back to her lips  only when voorst was at home did she seem more
contented 

three days before the marriage  olla arrived to help in the last
preparations  she was one of the handsomest girls in the neighborhood 
and besides her beauty was an heiress  for her father  whose only child
she was  owned large tracts of pasture on the mainland  as well as the
greater part of the island of urk  where he had a valuable dairy  the
family crowded to the door to welcome olla  she came in with voorst  who
had rowed over to urk for her   tall  blooming  with flaxen tresses
hanging below her waist  and a pair of dancing hazel eyes fringed with
long lashes  voorst was almost as good looking in his way   they made a
very handsome couple 

 and this must be the stranger maiden of whom voorst has so often told
me   said olla after the first greetings had been exchanged  she smiled
at ebba  and tried to take her hand  but the elfish creature frowned 
retreated  and  when olla persisted  snatched her hand away with an
angry gesture and put it behind her back 

 why does she dislike me so   asked olla  discomfited and grieved  for
she had meant to be kind 

 oh  she doesn t dislike thee  she couldn t   cried peace loving
jacqueline 

but ebba did dislike olla  though no one understood why  she would
neither go near nor look at her if she could help it  and when  in the
evening  she and voorst sat on the doorstep talking together in low
tones  ebba hastened out  placed herself between them  and tried to push
olla away  uttering pitiful little wailing cries 

 what does ail her   asked jacqueline  metje made no answer  but she
looked troubled  she felt that there was sorrow ahead for ebba or for
voorst  and she loved them both 

the wedding day dawned clear and cloudless  as a marriage day should 
jacqueline in her bravery of stiff gilded head dress with its long
scarf like veil  her snowy bodice  and necklace of many colored beads 
was a dazzling figure  olla was scarcely less so  and she blushed and
dimpled as voorst led her along in the bridal procession  ebba walked
behind them  she  too  had been made fine in a scarlet bodice and a
grand cap with wings like that which metje wore  but she did not seem to
care that she was so well dressed  her sad eyes followed the forms of
olla and voorst  and as she limped painfully along after them  she
moaned continually to herself  a low  inarticulate  wordless murmur like
the sound of the sea 

following the marriage mass came the marriage feast  goodman huyt sat at
the head of the table  the mother at the foot  and  side by side  the
newly wedded pair  opposite them sat voorst and olla  his expression of
triumphant satisfaction  and her blushes and demurely contented glances 
had not been unobserved by the guests  so no one was very much surprised
when  in the midst of the festivity  the father rose  and knocked with
his tankard on the table to insure silence 

 neighbors and kinsfolk  one marriage maketh another  saith the old
proverb  and we are like to prove it a true one  i hereby announce that 
with consent of parents on both sides  my son voorst is troth plight
with olla the daughter of my old friend tronk who sits here    slapping
tronk on the shoulder    and i would now ask you to drink with me a
high health to the young couple   suiting the action to the word  he
filled the glass with hollands  raised it  pronounced the toast   a
high health to voorst huyt and to his bride olla tronk   and swallowed
the spirits at a draught 

ebba  who against her will had been made to sit at the board among the
other guests  had listened to this speech with no understanding of its
meaning  but as she listened to the laughter and applause which followed
it  and saw people slapping voorst on the back with loud congratulations
and shaking hands with olla  she raised her head with a flash of
interest  she watched voorst rise in his place with olla by his side 
while the rest reseated themselves  she heard him utter a few sentences 
what they meant she knew not  but he looked at olla  and when  after
draining his glass  he turned  put his arm round olla s neck  drew her
head close to his own  and their lips met in a kiss  some meaning of the
ceremony seemed to burst upon her  she started from her seat  for one
moment she stood motionless with dilated eyes and parted lips  then she
gave a long wild cry and fled from the house 

 what is the matter  who screamed   asked old huyt  who had observed
nothing 

 it is nothing  the poor dumb child over there   answered his wife 

metje looked anxiously at the door  the duties of hospitality held her
to her place   she will come in presently and i will comfort her   she
thought to herself 

but ebba never  came in  again  when metje was set free to search  all
trace of her had vanished  as suddenly and mysteriously as she had come
into their lives she had passed out of them again  no one had seen her
go forth from the door  no trace could be found of her on land or sea 
only an old fisherman  who was drawing his nets that day at a little
distance from the shore  averred that just after high noon he had
noticed a shape wearing a fluttering garment like that of a woman pass
slowly over the ridge of the dike just where it made a sudden curve to
the left  he had had the curiosity to row that way after his net was
safely pulled in  for he wanted to see if there was a boat lying there 
or what could take any one to so unlikely a spot  but neither boat nor
woman could be found  and he half fancied that he must have fallen
asleep in broad daylight and dreamed for a moment 

however that might be  ebba was gone  nor was anything ever known of her
again  metje mourned her loss  all the more that jacqueline s departure
left her with no mate of her own age in the household  little karen
cried for  ebbe  for a night or two  the vrow missed her aid in the
spinning  but voorst  absorbed in his happiness  scarcely noted her
absence  and olla was glad 

gradually she grew to be a tradition of the neighborhood  handed down
from one generation to another even to this day  and nobody ever knew
whence she came or where she went  or whether it was a mortal maiden or
one of the children of the strange  solemn sea folk who was cast so
curiously upon the hands of the kindly friesland family and dwelt in
their midst for two speechless years 

    note   the tradition on which this story is founded  and which
    is still held as true in some parts of friesland  is referred to
    by parival in his book   les delices de hollande

_miss alcott is really a benefactor of households _  h  h 

_miss alcott has a faculty of entering into the lives and feelings of
children that is conspicuously wanting in most writers who address them 
and to this cause  to the consciousness among her readers that they are
hearing about people like themselves  instead of abstract qualities
labelled with names  the popularity of her books is due _  mrs  sarah j

Book the First--Recalled to Life




I. The Period


It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us,
we had nothing before us,
we were all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of
its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.

It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,
as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth
blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had
heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were
made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane
ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its
messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally
deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the
earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,
from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange
to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any
communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane
brood.

France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty
yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and
Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,
already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into
boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in
it, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses
of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were
sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with
rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which
the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of
the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work
unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about
with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion
that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.

In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;
families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing
their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman
in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
"the Captain," gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, "in consequence of the
failure of his ammunition:" after which the mail was robbed in peace;
that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London
gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law
fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball;
thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at
Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search
for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the
musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences
much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on
Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the
hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of
Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer,
and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of
sixpence.

All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close
upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.
Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,
those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the
fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small
creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the
roads that lay before them.




II. The Mail


It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.
The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,
as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish
for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,
and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the
horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the
coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back
to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in
combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose
otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals
are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to
their duty.

With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through
the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were
falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested
them and brought them to a stand, with a wary "Wo-ho! so-ho-then!" the
near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an
unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the
hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a
nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.

There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its
forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the
air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the
waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out
everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,
and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
into it, as if they had made it all.

Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the
side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the
ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from
anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was
hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from
the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers
were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on
the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,
when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in
"the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard
of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as
he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass.

The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected
the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they
all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but
the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have
taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the
journey.

"Wo-ho!" said the coachman. "So, then! One more pull and you're at the
top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to
it!--Joe!"

"Halloa!" the guard replied.

"What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"

"Ten minutes, good, past eleven."

"My blood!" ejaculated the vexed coachman, "and not atop of Shooter's
yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!"

The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,
made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its
passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach
stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three
had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead
into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of
getting shot instantly as a highwayman.

The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.

"Tst! Joe!" cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his
box.

"What do you say, Tom?"

They both listened.

"I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."

"_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom," returned the guard, leaving his hold
of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. "Gentlemen! In the king's
name, all of you!"

With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on
the offensive.

The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in;
the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He
remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained
in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard,
and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked
back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up
his ears and looked back, without contradicting.

The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring
of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to
the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the
passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the
quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding
the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.

The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.

"So-ho!" the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. "Yo there! Stand!
I shall fire!"

The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering,
a man's voice called from the mist, "Is that the Dover mail?"

"Never you mind what it is!" the guard retorted. "What are you?"

"_Is_ that the Dover mail?"

"Why do you want to know?"

"I want a passenger, if it is."

"What passenger?"

"Mr. Jarvis Lorry."

Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard,
the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.

"Keep where you are," the guard called to the voice in the mist,
"because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in
your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight."

"What is the matter?" asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering
speech. "Who wants me? Is it Jerry?"

("I don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry," growled the guard to
himself. "He's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.")

"Yes, Mr. Lorry."

"What is the matter?"

"A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co."

"I know this messenger, guard," said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the
road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two
passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and
pulled up the window. "He may come close; there's nothing wrong."

"I hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that," said the
guard, in gruff soliloquy. "Hallo you!"

"Well! And hallo you!" said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.

"Come on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that
saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil
at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So
now let's look at you."

The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist,
and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The rider
stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger
a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and
rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of
the man.

"Guard!" said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.

The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman,
answered curtly, "Sir."

"There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must
know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown
to drink. I may read this?"

"If so be as you're quick, sir."

He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and
read--first to himself and then aloud: "'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.'
It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED
TO LIFE."

Jerry started in his saddle. "That's a Blazing strange answer, too,"
said he, at his hoarsest.

"Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night."

With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at
all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted
their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general
pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape
the hazard of originating any other kind of action.

The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing round
it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss
in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents, and
having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a
few smith's tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was
furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw,
and get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in
five minutes.

"Tom!" softly over the coach roof.

"Hallo, Joe."

"Did you hear the message?"

"I did, Joe."

"What did you make of it, Tom?"

"Nothing at all, Joe."

"That's a coincidence, too," the guard mused, "for I made the same of it
myself."

Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not
only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of
holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his
heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within
hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the
hill.

"After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level," said this hoarse messenger,
glancing at his mare. "'Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange
message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You'd
be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion,
Jerry!"




III. The Night Shadows


A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is
constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A
solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every
one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every
room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating
heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of
its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the
awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I
turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time
to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable
water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses
of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the
book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read
but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an
eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood
in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead,
my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable
consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that
individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In
any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there
a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?

As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the
messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old mail
coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each had
been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him and the next.

The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes that
assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black, with
no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together--as if they
were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept too
far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat like
a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer's knees. When he stopped
for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he
poured his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he
muffled again.

"No, Jerry, no!" said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode.
"It wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't
suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he'd
been a drinking!"

His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several
times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might
have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.

While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night
watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who
was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such
shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness.
They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.

What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon
its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms
their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.

Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank
passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what
lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger,
and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special
jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little
coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the
bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great
stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money,
and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with
all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then
the strong-rooms underground, at Tellson's, with such of their valuable
stores and secrets as were known to the passenger (and it was not a
little that he knew about them), opened before him, and he went in among
them with the great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them
safe, and strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.

But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the coach
(in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
always with him, there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave.

Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before him
was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed,
and in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt,
defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of this
spectre:

"Buried how long?"

The answer was always the same: "Almost eighteen years."

"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"

"Long ago."

"You know that you are recalled to life?"

"They tell me so."

"I hope you care to live?"

"I can't say."

"Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?"

The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes
the broken reply was, "Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too soon."
Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it was,
"Take me to her." Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and then it
was, "I don't know her. I don't understand."

After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would dig,
and dig, dig--now with a spade, now with a great key, now with his
hands--to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The
passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the
reality of mist and rain on his cheek.

Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving
patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating
by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train
of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the
real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express
sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out
of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost
it again.

"Buried how long?"

"Almost eighteen years."

"I hope you care to live?"

"I can't say."

Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two
slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again
slid away into the bank and the grave.

"Buried how long?"

"Almost eighteen years."

"You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?"

"Long ago."

The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in
his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone.

He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a
ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.

"Eighteen years!" said the passenger, looking at the sun. "Gracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!"




IV. The Preparation


When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as his
custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail journey
from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an adventurous
traveller upon.

By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be
congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disagreeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather
like a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out
of it in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and
muddy legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.

"There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?"

"Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed,
sir?"

"I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber."

"And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please.
Show Concord! Gentleman's valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off
gentleman's boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.)
Fetch barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!"

The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by the
mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up from
head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment of the
Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go into it,
all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another
drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were all
loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord
and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed in a
brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with large
square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his way to
his breakfast.

The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the gentleman
in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and as he sat,
with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so still,
that he might have been sitting for his portrait.

Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee, and a
loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waist-coat,
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a
fine texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his
head: which wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which
looked far more as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass.
His linen, though not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings,
was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring
beach, or the specks of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A
face habitually suppressed and quieted, was still lighted up under the
quaint wig by a pair of moist bright eyes that it must have cost
their owner, in years gone by, some pains to drill to the composed and
reserved expression of Tellson's Bank. He had a healthy colour in his
cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore few traces of anxiety.
But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in Tellson's Bank were
principally occupied with the cares of other people; and perhaps
second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily off and on.

Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait,
Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused him,
and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:

"I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come here at any
time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may only ask for a
gentleman from Tellson's Bank. Please to let me know."

"Yes, sir. Tellson's Bank in London, sir?"

"Yes."

"Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in
their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and Paris, sir. A
vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company's House."

"Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one."

"Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?"

"Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we--since I--came last
from France."

"Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people's
time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir."

"I believe so."

"But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen
years ago?"

"You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far from
the truth."

"Indeed, sir!"

Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward from the
table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his left,
dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest while
he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the
immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.

When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll on
the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine
ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling
wildly about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was
destruction. It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and
brought the coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong
a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be
dipped in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little
fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by
night, and looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide
made, and was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever,
sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.

As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry's thoughts seemed to cloud
too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire, awaiting
his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily digging,
digging, digging, in the live red coals.

A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has
got to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.

He set down his glass untouched. "This is Mam'selle!" said he.

In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss Manette
had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from
Tellson's.

"So soon?"

Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required none
then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson's
immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.

The gentleman from Tellson's had nothing left for it but to empty his
glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen
wig at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette's apartment.
It was a large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black
horsehair, and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and
oiled, until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room
were gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if _they_ were buried, in deep
graves of black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected
from them until they were dug out.

The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking his
way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed Miss Manette to be, for
the moment, in some adjacent room, until, having got past the two tall
candles, he saw standing to receive him by the table between them and
the fire, a young lady of not more than seventeen, in a riding-cloak,
and still holding her straw travelling-hat by its ribbon in her hand. As
his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure, a quantity of golden
hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an inquiring look, and
a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering how young and smooth
it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an expression that was
not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm, or merely of a bright
fixed attention, though it included all the four expressions--as his
eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness passed before him,
of a child whom he had held in his arms on the passage across that very
Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted heavily and the sea ran
high. The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of
the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital
procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were
offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the
feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.

"Pray take a seat, sir." In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.

"I kiss your hand, miss," said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier
date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.

"I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence--or discovery--"

"The word is not material, miss; either word will do."

"--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so
long dead--"

Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for
anybody in their absurd baskets!

"--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate
with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for
the purpose."

"Myself."

"As I was prepared to hear, sir."

She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a
pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he
was than she. He made her another bow.

"I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to
France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with
me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself,
during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The
gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to
beg the favour of his waiting for me here."

"I was happy," said Mr. Lorry, "to be entrusted with the charge. I shall
be more happy to execute it."

"Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told me
by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of the
business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are."

"Naturally," said Mr. Lorry. "Yes--I--"

After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, "It is very difficult to begin."

He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression--but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular--and she raised her hand,
as if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow.

"Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?"

"Am I not?" Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with
an argumentative smile.

Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line of
which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and the
moment she raised her eyes again, went on:

"In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address you
as a young English lady, Miss Manette?"

"If you please, sir."

"Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don't heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine--truly, I am not much else. I will, with
your leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers."

"Story!"

He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he added,
in a hurry, "Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually call
our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific
gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor."

"Not of Beauvais?"

"Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him there.
Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at that
time in our French House, and had been--oh! twenty years."

"At that time--I may ask, at what time, sir?"

"I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married--an English lady--and
I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson's hands.
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss;
there is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like
sentiment. I have passed from one to another, in the course of my
business life, just as I pass from one of our customers to another in
the course of my business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere
machine. To go on--"

"But this is my father's story, sir; and I begin to think"--the
curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him--"that when I was
left an orphan through my mother's surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you."

Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub
his chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking
down into her face while she sat looking up into his.

"Miss Manette, it _was_ I. And you will see how truly I spoke of myself
just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations I hold
with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you reflect
that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward of
Tellson's House since, and I have been busy with the other business of
Tellson's House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle."

After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr. Lorry
flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which was most
unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was
before), and resumed his former attitude.

"So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your
regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died
when he did--Don't be frightened! How you start!"

She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.

"Pray," said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand from
the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that clasped
him in so violent a tremble: "pray control your agitation--a matter of
business. As I was saying--"

Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began anew:

"As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had suddenly
and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had not
been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid
to speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the
privilege of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one
to the oblivion of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had
implored the king, the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of
him, and all quite in vain;--then the history of your father would have
been the history of this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais."

"I entreat you to tell me more, sir."

"I will. I am going to. You can bear it?"

"I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment."

"You speak collectedly, and you--_are_ collected. That's good!" (Though
his manner was less satisfied than his words.) "A matter of business.
Regard it as a matter of business--business that must be done. Now
if this doctor's wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit,
had suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was
born--"

"The little child was a daughter, sir."

"A daughter. A-a-matter of business--don't be distressed. Miss, if the
poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the
inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by
rearing her in the belief that her father was dead--No, don't kneel! In
Heaven's name why should you kneel to me!"

"For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!"

"A--a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind."

Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he had
very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she
communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.

"That's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before
you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with
you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened
her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old,
to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud
upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his
heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years."

As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have
been already tinged with grey.

"You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new
discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--"

He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.

"But he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too
probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best.
Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant
in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to
restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort."

A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said, in a
low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,

"I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost--not him!"

Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. "There, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you, now.
You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and, with a fair
sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his dear side."

She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, "I have been free, I
have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!"

"Only one thing more," said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention: "he has been found under
another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject,
anywhere or in any way, and to remove him--for a while at all
events--out of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even
Tellson's, important as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of
the matter. I carry about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring
to it. This is a secret service altogether. My credentials, entries,
and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, 'Recalled to Life;'
which may mean anything. But what is the matter! She doesn't notice a
word! Miss Manette!"

Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved or
branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that he
feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving.

A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to
be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed in some
extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a most
wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good measure too,
or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in advance of the
inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the
poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest, and sending him
flying back against the nearest wall.

("I really think this must be a man!" was Mr. Lorry's breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)

"Why, look at you all!" bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants.
"Why don't you go and fetch things, instead of standing there staring
at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don't you go and fetch
things? I'll let you know, if you don't bring smelling-salts, cold
water, and vinegar, quick, I will."

There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
gentleness: calling her "my precious!" and "my bird!" and spreading her
golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.

"And you in brown!" she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
"couldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
you call _that_ being a Banker?"

Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn
servants under the mysterious penalty of "letting them know" something
not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a
regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head
upon her shoulder.

"I hope she will do well now," said Mr. Lorry.

"No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!"

"I hope," said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, "that you accompany Miss Manette to France?"

"A likely thing, too!" replied the strong woman. "If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?"

This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to
consider it.




V. The Wine-shop


A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just
outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.

All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in
the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with
handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants'
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran;
others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and
there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new
directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed
pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted
fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the
wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up
along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street,
if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous
presence.

A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women,
and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There
was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a
special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part
of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the
luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths,
shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen
together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been
most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man who
had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged into
the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and a gloom
gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than sunshine.

The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow street
in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It had
stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet, and many
wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood, left red marks
on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed her baby, was
stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her head again.
Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a
tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his
head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled
upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD.

The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.

And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary
gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was
heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them;
but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a
terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the
fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner,
passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered
in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which
had worked them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the
children had ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the
grown faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed out
of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles and
lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood and
paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of
firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the smokeless
chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no offal,
among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription on the
baker's shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock of
bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil.

Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them; nor
compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads knitted
into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or
inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the shops)
were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman
painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest of
meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wine-shops,
croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and were
gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler's knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith's hammers were heavy, and the
gunmaker's stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement,
with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but
broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends, ran down
the middle of the street--when it ran at all: which was only after heavy
rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses. Across
the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a rope and
pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and lighted,
and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a sickly
manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea, and
the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.

For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over
France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of
song and feather, took no warning.

The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its
appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine. "It's not my affair," said he, with a final shrug
of the shoulders. "The people from the market did it. Let them bring
another."

There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
he called to him across the way:

"Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?"

The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his tribe too.

"What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?" said the wine-shop
keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of
mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. "Why do you write
in the public streets? Is there--tell me thou--is there no other place
to write such words in?"

In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally,
perhaps not) upon the joker's heart. The joker rapped it with his
own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic dancing
attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his
hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.

"Put it on, put it on," said the other. "Call wine, wine; and finish
there." With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker's
dress, such as it was--quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.

This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of thirty,
and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it was a
bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his own
crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with good
eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured looking on
the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of a strong
resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met, rushing
down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing would turn
the man.

Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age, with
a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large hand
heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure of
manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which one might
have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against herself
in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being
sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity of bright
shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment of her large
earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid it down to pick
her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her right elbow supported
by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing when her lord came in, but
coughed just one grain of cough. This, in combination with the lifting
of her darkly defined eyebrows over her toothpick by the breadth of a
line, suggested to her husband that he would do well to look round the
shop among the customers, for any new customer who had dropped in while
he stepped over the way.

The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the
elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, "This is our man."

"What the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?" said Monsieur Defarge
to himself; "I don't know you."

But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse
with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter.

"How goes it, Jacques?" said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. "Is
all the spilt wine swallowed?"

"Every drop, Jacques," answered Monsieur Defarge.

When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge,
picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough,
and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

"It is not often," said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, "that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or
of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?"

"It is so, Jacques," Monsieur Defarge returned.

At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still
using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.

The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.

"Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
right, Jacques?"

"You are right, Jacques," was the response of Monsieur Defarge.

This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment
when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and
slightly rustled in her seat.

"Hold then! True!" muttered her husband. "Gentlemen--my wife!"

The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three
flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and
giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the
wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose
of spirit, and became absorbed in it.

"Gentlemen," said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly
upon her, "good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you
wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the
fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here," pointing with his hand, "near to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been
there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!"

They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly
gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.

"Willingly, sir," said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to
the door.

Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had
not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.

Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus,
joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own
company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard,
and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited
by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the
gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee
to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was
a gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable
transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour
in his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret,
angry, dangerous man.

"It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly."
Thus, Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began
ascending the stairs.

"Is he alone?" the latter whispered.

"Alone! God help him, who should be with him!" said the other, in the
same low voice.

"Is he always alone, then?"

"Yes."

"Of his own desire?"

"Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril be
discreet--as he was then, so he is now."

"He is greatly changed?"

"Changed!"

The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half so
forcible. Mr. Lorry's spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher.

Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building--that is to say,
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general
staircase--left its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides
flinging other refuse from its own windows. The uncontrollable and
hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted
the air, even if poverty and deprivation had not loaded it with their
intangible impurities; the two bad sources combined made it almost
insupportable. Through such an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt
and poison, the way lay. Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to
his young companion's agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr.
Jarvis Lorry twice stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made
at a doleful grating, by which any languishing good airs that were left
uncorrupted, seemed to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed
to crawl in. Through the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer
or lower than the summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any
promise on it of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.

At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in
advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though he
dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself about
here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried over
his shoulder, took out a key.

"The door is locked then, my friend?" said Mr. Lorry, surprised.

"Ay. Yes," was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.

"You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?"

"I think it necessary to turn the key." Monsieur Defarge whispered it
closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.

"Why?"

"Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be
frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what
harm--if his door was left open."

"Is it possible!" exclaimed Mr. Lorry.

"Is it possible!" repeated Defarge, bitterly. "Yes. And a beautiful
world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things
are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under
that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on."

This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word
of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled
under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety,
and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent
on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.

"Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a
moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you
bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side.
That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!"

They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were
soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at
once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at
the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which
the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing
footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed
themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the
wine-shop.

"I forgot them in the surprise of your visit," explained Monsieur
Defarge. "Leave us, good boys; we have business here."

The three glided by, and went silently down.

There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:

"Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?"

"I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few."

"Is that well?"

"_I_ think it is well."

"Who are the few? How do you choose them?"

"I choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the
sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another
thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment."

With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in
through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck
twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to
make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it,
three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned
it as heavily as he could.

The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into the
room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little more
than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.

He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr. Lorry
got his arm securely round the daughter's waist, and held her; for he
felt that she was sinking.

"A-a-a-business, business!" he urged, with a moisture that was not of
business shining on his cheek. "Come in, come in!"

"I am afraid of it," she answered, shuddering.

"Of it? What?"

"I mean of him. Of my father."

Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning of
their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.

Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did,
methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread to
where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.

The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was dim
and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door in the
roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of this
door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little way.
Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means, that it
was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking at
him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very
busy, making shoes.




VI. The Shoemaker


"Good day!" said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head that
bent low over the shoemaking.

It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:

"Good day!"

"You are still hard at work, I see?"

After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and the
voice replied, "Yes--I am working." This time, a pair of haggard eyes
had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.

The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo
of a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive
it was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller,
wearied out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered
home and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.

Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had looked
up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull mechanical
perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor they were
aware of had stood, was not yet empty.

"I want," said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker,
"to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?"

The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening,
at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.

"What did you say?"

"You can bear a little more light?"

"I must bear it, if you let it in." (Laying the palest shadow of a
stress upon the second word.)

The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at that
angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in his
labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at his
feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not very
long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness and
thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under his yet
dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had been really
otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so.
His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed his body
to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and his loose
stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long seclusion
from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of
parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which was which.

He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very bones
of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had
lost the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without
first wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.

"Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?" asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.

"What did you say?"

"Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?"

"I can't say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don't know."

But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it again.

Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door. When
he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the shoemaker
looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure, but the
unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he looked at
it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour), and then
the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the shoe. The
look and the action had occupied but an instant.

"You have a visitor, you see," said Monsieur Defarge.

"What did you say?"

"Here is a visitor."

The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand from his
work.

"Come!" said Defarge. "Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made shoe when
he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take it, monsieur."

Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.

"Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker's name."

There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:

"I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?"

"I said, couldn't you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur's
information?"

"It is a lady's shoe. It is a young lady's walking-shoe. It is in the
present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand." He
glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.

"And the maker's name?" said Defarge.

Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right hand
in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand in the
hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded chin, and
so on in regular changes, without a moment's intermission. The task of
recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank when he
had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from a swoon, or
endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the spirit of a
fast-dying man.

"Did you ask me for my name?"

"Assuredly I did."

"One Hundred and Five, North Tower."

"Is that all?"

"One Hundred and Five, North Tower."

With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to work
again, until the silence was again broken.

"You are not a shoemaker by trade?" said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly
at him.

His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred the
question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned back
on the questioner when they had sought the ground.

"I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by trade. I-I
learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to--"

He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes on his
hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the face
from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started, and
resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting to a
subject of last night.

"I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since."

As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him, Mr.
Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:

"Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?"

The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner.

"Monsieur Manette"; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; "do you
remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old
banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your
mind, Monsieur Manette?"

As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who
had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where
she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only
raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression
repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.

Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and
less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground
and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long sigh, he
took the shoe up, and resumed his work.

"Have you recognised him, monsieur?" asked Defarge in a whisper.

"Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!"

She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour.

Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a spirit,
beside him, and he bent over his work.

It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand, for his shoemaker's knife. It lay on that side of him
which was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward,
but she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife, though they had.

He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in
the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard to say:

"What is this?"

With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to her
lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if she
laid his ruined head there.

"You are not the gaoler's daughter?"

She sighed "No."

"Who are you?"

Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down softly, as he sat staring at her.

Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly pushed
aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little and
little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action
he went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his
shoemaking.

But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to
be sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand
to his neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag
attached to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained
a very little quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden
hairs, which he had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.

He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. "It is
the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!"

As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed to
become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her.

"She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was summoned
out--she had a fear of my going, though I had none--and when I was
brought to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. 'You will
leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they
may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I remember them very
well."

He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it.
But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him coherently,
though slowly.

"How was this?--_Was it you_?"

Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with a
frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, "I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!"

"Hark!" he exclaimed. "Whose voice was that?"

His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his white
hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but his
shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and
gloomily shook his head.

"No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can't be. See what the
prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was--and He
was--before the slow years of the North Tower--ages ago. What is your
name, my gentle angel?"

Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her knees
before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.

"O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my mother was,
and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard history. But I
cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All that I may
tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and to bless
me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!"

His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed and
lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.

"If you hear in my voice--I don't know that it is so, but I hope it
is--if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was
sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in
touching my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your
breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when
I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you
with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the
remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away,
weep for it, weep for it!"

She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast like a
child.

"If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste,
and of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And
if, when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living,
and of my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my
honoured father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake
striven all day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of
my poor mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep
for her, then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred
tears upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank
God for us, thank God!"

He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a sight so
touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering which
had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.

When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his heaving
breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that must follow all
storms--emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence into which the storm
called Life must hush at last--they came forward to raise the father and
daughter from the ground. He had gradually dropped to the floor, and lay
there in a lethargy, worn out. She had nestled down with him, that his
head might lie upon her arm; and her hair drooping over him curtained
him from the light.

"If, without disturbing him," she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry as
he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, "all could be
arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the very door, he
could be taken away--"

"But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?" asked Mr. Lorry.

"More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him."

"It is true," said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear. "More
than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of France.
Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?"

"That's business," said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice his
methodical manners; "and if business is to be done, I had better do it."

"Then be so kind," urged Miss Manette, "as to leave us here. You see how
composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave him with me
now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to secure us from
interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when you come back,
as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care of him until
you return, and then we will remove him straight."

Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course, and
in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only carriage
and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time pressed,
for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.

Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down on the
hard ground close at the father's side, and watched him. The darkness
deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light gleamed
through the chinks in the wall.

Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and
had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and
meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this provender, and the
lamp he carried, on the shoemaker's bench (there was nothing else in the
garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry roused the captive, and
assisted him to his feet.

No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind, in
the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had happened,
whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether he knew that
he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have solved. They
tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very slow to
answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed for
the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of
occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been seen
in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter's voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.

In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he
ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on the cloak
and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily responded to
his daughter's drawing her arm through his, and took--and kept--her hand
in both his own.

They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp, Mr.
Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many steps
of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof and
round at the walls.

"You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up here?"

"What did you say?"

But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer as if
she had repeated it.

"Remember? No, I don't remember. It was so very long ago."

That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought from his
prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him mutter,
"One Hundred and Five, North Tower;" and when he looked about him, it
evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long encompassed
him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there was
no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street, he
dropped his daughter's hand and clasped his head again.

No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of the
many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An unnatural
silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be seen, and
that was Madame Defarge--who leaned against the door-post, knitting, and
saw nothing.

The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when Mr. Lorry's feet were arrested on the step by his asking,
miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame
Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
brought them down and handed them in;--and immediately afterwards leaned
against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.

Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word "To the Barrier!" The
postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps.

Under the over-swinging lamps--swinging ever brighter in the better
streets, and ever dimmer in the worse--and by lighted shops, gay crowds,
illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. "Your papers,
travellers!" "See here then, Monsieur the Officer," said Defarge,
getting down, and taking him gravely apart, "these are the papers of
monsieur inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with
him, at the--" He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the
military lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm
in uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day
or an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. "It is well.
Forward!" from the uniform. "Adieu!" from Defarge. And so, under a short
grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the great
grove of stars.

Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote from
this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry--sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were for ever
lost to him, and what were capable of restoration--the old inquiry:

"I hope you care to be recalled to life?"

And the old answer:

"I can't say."

Book the Second--the Golden Thread




I. Five Years Later


Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence
in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if
it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was
no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted
no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no
embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but
Tellson's, thank Heaven--!

Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable.

Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection
of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with
a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little
counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the
wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of
windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street,
and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
"the House," you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back,
where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its
hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal
twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden
drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when
they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they
were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among
the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good
polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms
made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their
parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family
papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great
dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year
one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you
by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released
from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads
exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of
Abyssinia or Ashantee.

But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.
Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?
Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note
was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the
purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder
of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to
Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of
three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to
Death. Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it
might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the
reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each
particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked
after. Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business,
its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid
low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately
disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the
ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.

Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the
oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young
man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was
old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full
Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to
be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches
and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.

Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an
odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live
sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless
upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin
of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson's,
in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always
tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted
this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful
occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the
easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry.

The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley,
Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March
morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself
always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under
the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a
popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)

Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were
but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it
might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as
it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was
already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged
for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth
was spread.

Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin
at home. At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll
and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair
looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture, he
exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:

"Bust me, if she ain't at it agin!"

A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees in a
corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was the
person referred to.

"What!" said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. "You're at it
agin, are you?"

After hailing the morn with this second salutation, he threw a boot at
the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce the
odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher's domestic economy, that,
whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots, he
often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.

"What," said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark--"what are you up to, Aggerawayter?"

"I was only saying my prayers."

"Saying your prayers! You're a nice woman! What do you mean by flopping
yourself down and praying agin me?"

"I was not praying against you; I was praying for you."

"You weren't. And if you were, I won't be took the liberty with. Here!
your mother's a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin your
father's prosperity. You've got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
You've got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched out
of the mouth of her only child."

Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning
to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board.

"And what do you suppose, you conceited female," said Mr. Cruncher, with
unconscious inconsistency, "that the worth of _your_ prayers may be?
Name the price that you put _your_ prayers at!"

"They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more than
that."

"Worth no more than that," repeated Mr. Cruncher. "They ain't worth
much, then. Whether or no, I won't be prayed agin, I tell you. I can't
afford it. I'm not a going to be made unlucky by _your_ sneaking. If
you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband and
child, and not in opposition to 'em. If I had had any but a unnat'ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat'ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck.
B-u-u-ust me!" said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting
on his clothes, "if I ain't, what with piety and one blowed thing and
another, been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor
devil of a honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my
boy, and while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and
then, and if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I
tell you," here he addressed his wife once more, "I won't be gone agin,
in this manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I'm as sleepy as
laudanum, my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn't know, if
it wasn't for the pain in 'em, which was me and which somebody else, yet
I'm none the better for it in pocket; and it's my suspicion that you've
been at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for
it in pocket, and I won't put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you
say now!"

Growling, in addition, such phrases as "Ah! yes! You're religious, too.
You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband
and child, would you? Not you!" and throwing off other sarcastic sparks
from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook
himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business.
In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes,
and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did,
kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor
woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made
his toilet, with a suppressed cry of "You are going to flop, mother.
--Halloa, father!" and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in
again with an undutiful grin.

Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his
breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular
animosity.

"Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?"

His wife explained that she had merely "asked a blessing."

"Don't do it!" said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions. "I
ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles
blest off my table. Keep still!"

Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
of the day.

It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
description of himself as "a honest tradesman." His stock consisted of
a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool,
young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to
beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where,
with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned
from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's
feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr.
Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar
itself,--and was almost as in-looking.

Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his
three-cornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson's,
Jerry took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar, to
inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic
in Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two
eyes of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else
in Fleet-street.

The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson's
establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:

"Porter wanted!"

"Hooray, father! Here's an early job to begin with!"

Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself on
the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing, and cogitated.

"Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!" muttered young Jerry.
"Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don't get no iron
rust here!"




II. A Sight


"You know the Old Bailey well, no doubt?" said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger.

"Ye-es, sir," returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. "I _do_
know the Bailey."

"Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry."

"I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
better," said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment
in question, "than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey."

"Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in."

"Into the court, sir?"

"Into the court."

Mr. Cruncher's eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and to
interchange the inquiry, "What do you think of this?"

"Am I to wait in the court, sir?" he asked, as the result of that
conference.

"I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry's
attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is,
to remain there until he wants you."

"Is that all, sir?"

"That's all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell him
you are there."

As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:

"I suppose they'll be trying Forgeries this morning?"

"Treason!"

"That's quartering," said Jerry. "Barbarous!"

"It is the law," remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
spectacles upon him. "It is the law."

"It's hard in the law to spile a man, I think. It's hard enough to kill
him, but it's wery hard to spile him, sir."

"Not at all," retained the ancient clerk. "Speak well of the law. Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself. I give you that advice."

"It's the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice," said Jerry. "I
leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is."

"Well, well," said the old clerk; "we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have dry
ways. Here is the letter. Go along."

Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of, "You are a lean old one,
too," made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination,
and went his way.

They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had
not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It
had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced
his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him.
For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard,
from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on
a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a
half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any.
So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It
was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted
a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for
the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and
softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in
blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism
that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome
consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.

Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down this
hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to make his
way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and handed in
his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see the play
at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam--only the
former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey
doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.

After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze himself into
court.

"What's on?" he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
to.

"Nothing yet."

"What's coming on?"

"The Treason case."

"The quartering one, eh?"

"Ah!" returned the man, with a relish; "he'll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged, and then he'll be taken down and sliced before his own
face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
and then his head will be chopped off, and he'll be cut into quarters.
That's the sentence."

"If he's found Guilty, you mean to say?" Jerry added, by way of proviso.

"Oh! they'll find him guilty," said the other. "Don't you be afraid of
that."

Mr. Cruncher's attention was here diverted to the door-keeper, whom he
saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand. Mr. Lorry
sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged
gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers
before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands
in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him
then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the
court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and signing
with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had stood up
to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.

"What's _he_ got to do with the case?" asked the man he had spoken with.

"Blest if I know," said Jerry.

"What have _you_ got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?"

"Blest if I know that either," said Jerry.

The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became the
central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
went out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.

Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the
ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled
at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round
pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows
stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court,
laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help
themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got
upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.
Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall
of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a
whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with
the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not,
that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him
in an impure mist and rain.

The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and
a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly
dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and
dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out
of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express
itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his
situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the
soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed,
bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.

The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at,
was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a less
horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.

Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not Guilty to
an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
to send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay, stood
there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.

The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet and
attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.

Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in
it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the
glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one
day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace
for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be
that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar
of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his
face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.

It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat,
in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look
immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his
aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.

The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than
twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very
remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair,
and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he
looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as
it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a
handsome man, not past the prime of life.

His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by
him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her
dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had
been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about,
"Who are they?"

Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own
manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:

"Witnesses."

"For which side?"

"Against."

"Against what side?"

"The prisoner's."

The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them,
leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was
in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the
axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.




III. A Disappointment


Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the
public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or
even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the
prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and
repassing between France and England, on secret business of which
he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of
traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real
wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.
That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who
was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the
prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his
Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.
That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and
attitude were, on the whole, sublime. That, he had been the prisoner's
friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his
infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish
in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country. That, if statues
were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public
benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as
they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one. That, Virtue,
as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well
knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues;
whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that
they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more
especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.
That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness
for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had
communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him
a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets,
and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr. Attorney-General) was prepared to
hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that,
in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr. Attorney-General's)
brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.
Attorney-General's) father and mother. That, he called with confidence
on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the evidence of these two
witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be
produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of
his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by
sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed
such information to a hostile power. That, these lists could not be
proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the
same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as
showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions. That, the proof
would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged
in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the
very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.
That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they
were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must
positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether
they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon their
pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying
their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion
of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that
there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon
pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off. That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith
of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as
good as dead and gone.

When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in
anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.

Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul was
exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be--perhaps, if
it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.

Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation.
What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property? He didn't
precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business of anybody's.
Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very
distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly not. Never in a debtors'
prison? Didn't see what that had to do with it. Never in a debtors'
prison?--Come, once again. Never? Yes. How many times? Two or three
times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever
been kicked? Might have been. Frequently? No. Ever kicked downstairs?
Decidedly not; once received a kick on the top of a staircase, and fell
downstairs of his own accord. Kicked on that occasion for cheating at
dice? Something to that effect was said by the intoxicated liar who
committed the assault, but it was not true. Swear it was not true?
Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never. Ever live by play? Not
more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow money of the prisoner? Yes.
Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy with the prisoner, in reality a
very slight one, forced upon the prisoner in coaches, inns, and packets?
No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these lists? Certain. Knew no more
about the lists? No. Had not procured them himself, for instance? No.
Expect to get anything by this evidence? No. Not in regular government
pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear
no. Swear that? Over and over again. No motives but motives of sheer
patriotism? None whatever.

The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at a
great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity--never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions of
the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging
his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the
prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from
the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there first. He
had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen
at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and
Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given
information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.

The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr. Jarvis
Lorry.

"Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson's bank?"

"I am."

"On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and
Dover by the mail?"

"It did."

"Were there any other passengers in the mail?"

"Two."

"Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?"

"They did."

"Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?"

"I cannot undertake to say that he was."

"Does he resemble either of these two passengers?"

"Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were all so
reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that."

"Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped up as
those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and stature to
render it unlikely that he was one of them?"

"No."

"You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?"

"No."

"So at least you say he may have been one of them?"

"Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been--like
myself--timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous
air."

"Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?"

"I certainly have seen that."

"Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him, to your
certain knowledge, before?"

"I have."

"When?"

"I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais, the
prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and made the
voyage with me."

"At what hour did he come on board?"

"At a little after midnight."

"In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on board
at that untimely hour?"

"He happened to be the only one."

"Never mind about 'happening,' Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who
came on board in the dead of the night?"

"He was."

"Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?"

"With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here."

"They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?"

"Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and rough, and
I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore."

"Miss Manette!"

The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were now
turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her, and
kept her hand drawn through his arm.

"Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner."

To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty, was
far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the crowd.
Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not all
the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve him
to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts
to control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.

"Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?"

"Yes, sir."

"Where?"

"On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the same
occasion."

"You are the young lady just now referred to?"

"O! most unhappily, I am!"

The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical voice
of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: "Answer the questions put
to you, and make no remark upon them."

"Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?"

"Yes, sir."

"Recall it."

In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: "When the
gentleman came on board--"

"Do you mean the prisoner?" inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.

"Yes, my Lord."

"Then say the prisoner."

"When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father," turning
her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, "was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take
care of him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four.
The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could
shelter my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I
had not known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would
set when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed
great gentleness and kindness for my father's state, and I am sure he
felt it. That was the manner of our beginning to speak together."

"Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?"

"No."

"How many were with him?"

"Two French gentlemen."

"Had they conferred together?"

"They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat."

"Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these lists?"

"Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don't know what
papers."

"Like these in shape and size?"

"Possibly, but indeed I don't know, although they stood whispering very
near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have the
light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and they
spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only that
they looked at papers."

"Now, to the prisoner's conversation, Miss Manette."

"The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me--which arose out
of my helpless situation--as he was kind, and good, and useful to my
father. I hope," bursting into tears, "I may not repay him by doing him
harm to-day."

Buzzing from the blue-flies.

"Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give--which you must
give--and which you cannot escape from giving--with great unwillingness,
he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on."

"He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a long
time to come."

"Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular."

"He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he said
that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one on
England's part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time."

Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor in
a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington.

Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's
father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.

"Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?"

"Once. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or
three years and a half ago."

"Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or
speak to his conversation with your daughter?"

"Sir, I can do neither."

"Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do
either?"

He answered, in a low voice, "There is."

"Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without
trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?"

He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, "A long imprisonment."

"Were you newly released on the occasion in question?"

"They tell me so."

"Have you no remembrance of the occasion?"

"None. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what
time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the
time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar. I have no remembrance of the process."

Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat down
together.

A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand being
to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked,
in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years ago, and
got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where he did
not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles or more,
to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information; a witness
was called to identify him as having been at the precise time required,
in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard town,
waiting for another person. The prisoner's counsel was cross-examining
this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the prisoner
on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had all this time
been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or two on a
little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening
this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner.

"You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?"

The witness was quite sure.

"Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?"

Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.

"Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there," pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over, "and then look well upon the
prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?"

Allowing for my learned friend's appearance being careless and slovenly
if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise,
not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus brought
into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned friend lay aside
his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became
much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver (the prisoner's
counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name of my learned
friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord, no; but he
would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened once, might
happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if he had seen
this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would be so
confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to smash
this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case to
useless lumber.

Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while Mr.
Stryver fitted the prisoner's case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy and
traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas--which he certainly did look
rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and partner,
and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers and false
swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some family
affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his making
those passages across the Channel--though what those affairs were, a
consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him,
even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been warped
and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it they
had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;--with the exception of that
reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies
and fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it;
how, nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous
character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the
State Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed
(with as grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could
not sit upon that Bench and suffer those allusions.

Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next to
attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes Mr.
Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole
decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.

And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed again.

Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement.
While his learned friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him,
whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced
anxiously at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and
grouped themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat,
and slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man
sat leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put
on just as it had happened to light on his head after its removal, his
hands in his pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all
day. Something especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him
a disreputable look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness,
when they were compared together, had strengthened), that many of the
lookers-on, taking note of him now, said to one another they would
hardly have thought the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the
observation to his next neighbour, and added, "I'd hold half a guinea
that _he_ don't get no law-work to do. Don't look like the sort of one
to get any, do he?"

Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette's head dropped upon
her father's breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly:
"Officer! look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out.
Don't you see she will fall!"

There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and much
sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress to
him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering or
brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy cloud,
ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and paused a
moment, spoke, through their foreman.

They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with George
Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were not agreed,
but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch and ward,
and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the lamps in
the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured that the
jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to get
refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and sat
down.

Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out,
now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest,
could easily get near him.

"Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the
way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a moment
behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You
are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long
before I can."

Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up
at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.

"How is the young lady?"

"She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
feels the better for being out of court."

"I'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman
like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know."

Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point
in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar.
The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all
eyes, ears, and spikes.

"Mr. Darnay!"

The prisoner came forward directly.

"You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She
will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation."

"I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so
for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?"

"Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it."

Mr. Carton's manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He stood,
half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against the bar.

"I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks."

"What," said Carton, still only half turned towards him, "do you expect,
Mr. Darnay?"

"The worst."

"It's the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour."

Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them--so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner--standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above
them.

An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded
passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale.
The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that
refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide
of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along
with them.

"Jerry! Jerry!" Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got
there.

"Here, sir! It's a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!"

Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. "Quick! Have you got
it?"

"Yes, sir."

Hastily written on the paper was the word "ACQUITTED."

"If you had sent the message, 'Recalled to Life,' again," muttered
Jerry, as he turned, "I should have known what you meant, this time."

He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything else,
until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring out
with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in
search of other carrion.




IV. Congratulatory


From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long
lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition
from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of
itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those
unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual
Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three
hundred miles away.

Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from
his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his
misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice,
the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial
influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for she could
recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few
and slight, and she believed them over.

Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned
to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little
more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.

He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his
late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean
out of the group: "I am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr.
Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the
less likely to succeed on that account."

"You have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,"
said his late client, taking his hand.

"I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as
another man's, I believe."

It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, "Much better," Mr. Lorry
said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.

"You think so?" said Mr. Stryver. "Well! you have been present all day,
and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too."

"And as such," quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had
now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered
him out of it--"as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up
this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr.
Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out."

"Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver; "I have a night's work to
do yet. Speak for yourself."

"I speak for myself," answered Mr. Lorry, "and for Mr. Darnay, and for
Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?"
He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father.

His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away.

"My father," said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.

He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.

"Shall we go home, my father?"

With a long breath, he answered "Yes."

The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be
released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the
passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle,
and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of
gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.
Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into
the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter
departed in it.

Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or
interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning
against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now
stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement.

"So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?"

Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's
proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the
better for it in appearance.

"If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay."

Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, "You have mentioned that before,
sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We
have to think of the House more than ourselves."

"_I_ know, _I_ know," rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. "Don't be
nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better,
I dare say."

"And indeed, sir," pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, "I really don't
know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very
much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your
business."

"Business! Bless you, _I_ have no business," said Mr. Carton.

"It is a pity you have not, sir."

"I think so, too."

"If you had," pursued Mr. Lorry, "perhaps you would attend to it."

"Lord love you, no!--I shouldn't," said Mr. Carton.

"Well, sir!" cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
"business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance
for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir!
I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.--Chair there!"

Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:

"This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?"

"I hardly seem yet," returned Charles Darnay, "to belong to this world
again."

"I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly."

"I begin to think I _am_ faint."

"Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at."

Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to
Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.

"Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr.
Darnay?"

"I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that."

"It must be an immense satisfaction!"

He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
one.

"As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we
are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are
not much alike in any particular, you and I."

Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was
at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.

"Now your dinner is done," Carton presently said, "why don't you call a
health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?"

"What health? What toast?"

"Why, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll
swear it's there."

"Miss Manette, then!"

"Miss Manette, then!"

Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton
flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to
pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.

"That's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!"
he said, filling his new goblet.

A slight frown and a laconic "Yes," were the answer.

"That's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it
feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?"

Again Darnay answered not a word.

"She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not
that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was."

The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this
disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the
strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him
for it.

"I neither want any thanks, nor merit any," was the careless rejoinder.
"It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did
it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question."

"Willingly, and a small return for your good offices."

"Do you think I particularly like you?"

"Really, Mr. Carton," returned the other, oddly disconcerted, "I have
not asked myself the question."

"But ask yourself the question now."

"You have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do."

"_I_ don't think I do," said Carton. "I begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding."

"Nevertheless," pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, "there is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side."

Carton rejoining, "Nothing in life!" Darnay rang. "Do you call the whole
reckoning?" said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, "Then
bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
ten."

The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, "A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?"

"I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton."

"Think? You know I have been drinking."

"Since I must say so, I know it."

"Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I
care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me."

"Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better."

"May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don't let your sober face elate you,
however; you don't know what it may come to. Good night!"

When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to a
glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.

"Do you particularly like the man?" he muttered, at his own image; "why
should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is nothing
in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a change you have
made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man, that he shows you
what you have fallen away from, and what you might have been! Change
places with him, and would you have been looked at by those blue eyes as
he was, and commiserated by that agitated face as he was? Come on, and
have it out in plain words! You hate the fellow."

He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.




V. The Jackal


Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate
statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would swallow
in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation as a
perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration.
The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any other
learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was Mr.
Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race.

A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver had
begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on which
he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their favourite,
specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the
visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench, the
florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out of
the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun from
among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.

It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that
faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is
among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments.
But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more
business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its
pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning.

Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great
ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas,
might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand,
anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring
at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there
they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was
rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily
to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get about,
among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton
would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal, and that he
rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.

"Ten o'clock, sir," said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged to
wake him--"ten o'clock, sir."

"_What's_ the matter?"

"Ten o'clock, sir."

"What do you mean? Ten o'clock at night?"

"Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you."

"Oh! I remember. Very well, very well."

After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man
dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes,
he got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King's
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.

The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers on,
and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease. He
had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of
Jeffries downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of
Art, through the portraits of every Drinking Age.

"You are a little late, Memory," said Stryver.

"About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later."

They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with papers,
where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob, and in
the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of wine upon
it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.

"You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney."

"Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day's client; or
seeing him dine--it's all one!"

"That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?"

"I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should have
been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck."

Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.

"You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work."

Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining
room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a towel
or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing them
out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold, sat down
at the table, and said, "Now I am ready!"

"Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory," said Mr. Stryver,
gaily, as he looked among his papers.

"How much?"

"Only two sets of them."

"Give me the worst first."

"There they are, Sydney. Fire away!"

The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of the
drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to
his hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in
a different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in
his waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some
lighter document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face,
so deep in his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he
stretched out for his glass--which often groped about, for a minute or
more, before it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the
matter in hand became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on
him to get up, and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the
jug and basin, he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as
no words can describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious
gravity.

At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion, and
proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to meditate. The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bumper for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal;
this was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not
disposed of until the clocks struck three in the morning.

"And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch," said Mr.
Stryver.

The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming
again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.

"You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses
to-day. Every question told."

"I always am sound; am I not?"

"I don't gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some punch to
it and smooth it again."

With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.

"The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School," said Stryver, nodding
his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the past, "the
old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now in spirits and
now in despondency!"

"Ah!" returned the other, sighing: "yes! The same Sydney, with the same
luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my own."

"And why not?"

"God knows. It was my way, I suppose."

He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him, looking at the fire.

"Carton," said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney
Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, "your way
is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose. Look
at me."

"Oh, botheration!" returned Sydney, with a lighter and more
good-humoured laugh, "don't _you_ be moral!"

"How have I done what I have done?" said Stryver; "how do I do what I
do?"

"Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to
do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind."

"I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?"

"I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were," said
Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.

"Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,"
pursued Carton, "you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of Paris,
picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that we
didn't get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was always
nowhere."

"And whose fault was that?"

"Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It's a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one's own past, with the day breaking.
Turn me in some other direction before I go."

"Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness," said Stryver, holding up
his glass. "Are you turned in a pleasant direction?"

Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.

"Pretty witness," he muttered, looking down into his glass. "I have had
enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who's your pretty witness?"

"The picturesque doctor's daughter, Miss Manette."

"_She_ pretty?"

"Is she not?"

"No."

"Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!"

"Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey a judge
of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!"

"Do you know, Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp eyes,
and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: "do you know, I rather
thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired doll,
and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?"

"Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons within a
yard or two of a man's nose, he can see it without a perspective-glass.
I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I'll have no more drink;
I'll get to bed."

When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to light
him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its grimy
windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and sad, the
dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like a
lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.

Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood still
on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in the
wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial, and
perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears.

Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of
good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.




VI. Hundreds of People


The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the
waves of four months had rolled over the trial for treason, and carried
it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into
business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the
quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.

On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in
the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with
them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and
generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have
his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the
Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them.

A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be
found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of
the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that
had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then,
north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers
grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields. As a
consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom,
instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a
settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which
the peaches ripened in their season.

The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a
glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.

There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall--as if
he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of all
visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind
the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way
from Sunday morning unto Saturday night.

Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and
its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him.
His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted.

These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine Sunday afternoon.

"Doctor Manette at home?"

Expected home.

"Miss Lucie at home?"

Expected home.

"Miss Pross at home?"

Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact.

"As I am at home myself," said Mr. Lorry, "I'll go upstairs."

Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off
by so many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy,
that its effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the
rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours,
the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by
delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in
themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry
stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him,
with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this
time, whether he approved?

There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them
all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which
he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was
the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.

"I wonder," said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, "that he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him!"

"And why wonder at that?" was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.

It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and
had since improved.

"I should have thought--" Mr. Lorry began.

"Pooh! You'd have thought!" said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off.

"How do you do?" inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice.

"I am pretty well, I thank you," answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; "how
are you?"

"Nothing to boast of," said Miss Pross.

"Indeed?"

"Ah! indeed!" said Miss Pross. "I am very much put out about my
Ladybird."

"Indeed?"

"For gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll
fidget me to death," said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness.

"Really, then?" said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.

"Really, is bad enough," returned Miss Pross, "but better. Yes, I am
very much put out."

"May I ask the cause?"

"I don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to
come here looking after her," said Miss Pross.

"_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?"

"Hundreds," said Miss Pross.

It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it.

"Dear me!" said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.

"I have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing--since she was ten years old. And it's really very hard,"
said Miss Pross.

Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his head;
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything.

"All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up," said Miss Pross. "When you began it--"

"_I_ began it, Miss Pross?"

"Didn't you? Who brought her father to life?"

"Oh! If _that_ was beginning it--" said Mr. Lorry.

"It wasn't ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird's affections away from me."

Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's.

"There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird," said
Miss Pross; "and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a
mistake in life."

Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had
established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon
(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious
matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.

"As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
business," he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
sat down there in friendly relations, "let me ask you--does the Doctor,
in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?"

"Never."

"And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?"

"Ah!" returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. "But I don't say he don't
refer to it within himself."

"Do you believe that he thinks of it much?"

"I do," said Miss Pross.

"Do you imagine--" Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up
short with:

"Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all."

"I stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?"

"Now and then," said Miss Pross.

"Do you suppose," Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his
bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, "that Doctor Manette has any
theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?"

"I don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me."

"And that is--?"

"That she thinks he has."

"Now don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a
mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business."

"Dull?" Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.

Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, "No, no,
no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor
Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me,
though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe me, Miss
Pross, I don't approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
zealous interest."

"Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad's the best, you'll tell
me," said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, "he is afraid
of the whole subject."

"Afraid?"

"It's plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It's a dreadful
remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn't make the
subject pleasant, I should think."

It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. "True," said
he, "and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, Miss
Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence."

"Can't be helped," said Miss Pross, shaking her head. "Touch that
string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone.
In short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in
the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
up and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down, in
his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up
and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself."

Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
her possessing such a thing.

The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.

"Here they are!" said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
"and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!"

It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window,
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross
was ready at the street door to receive them.

Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant
sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no
Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction.

Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased.

On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor's table, but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this occasion,
Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird's pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.

It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some
time before, as Mr. Lorry's cup-bearer; and while they sat under the
plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads.

Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only One.

Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, "a fit of the
jerks."

The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The
resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness.

He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
vivacity. "Pray, Doctor Manette," said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the
plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London--"have you seen much of
the Tower?"

"Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of
it, to know that it teems with interest; little more."

"_I_ have been there, as you remember," said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, "in another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
curious thing when I was there."

"What was that?" Lucie asked.

"In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which
had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of
its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by
prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone
in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to
execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with
some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand.
At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or
legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses
were made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested
that the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DIG. The
floor was examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the
earth beneath a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found
the ashes of a paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case
or bag. What the unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he
had written something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler."

"My father," exclaimed Lucie, "you are ill!"

He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner and
his look quite terrified them all.

"No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start. We had better go in."

He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in large
drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. But, he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
towards Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.

He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts of
his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.

Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks upon
her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in, but he
made only Two.

The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table was
done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton
leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of
the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the
ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.

"The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few," said Doctor
Manette. "It comes slowly."

"It comes surely," said Carton.

They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a
dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.

There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes
resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a
footstep was there.

"A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!" said Darnay, when they had
listened for a while.

"Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?" asked Lucie. "Sometimes, I have
sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of
a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn--"

"Let us shudder too. We may know what it is."

"It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we
originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made
the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming
by-and-bye into our lives."

"There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,"
Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.

The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more and more
rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet; some,
as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room; some
coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether; all in
the distant streets, and not one within sight.

"Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette, or
are we to divide them among us?"

"I don't know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father's."

"I take them into mine!" said Carton. "_I_ ask no questions and make no
stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss Manette,
and I see them--by the Lightning." He added the last words, after there
had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window.

"And I hear them!" he added again, after a peal of thunder. "Here they
come, fast, fierce, and furious!"

It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment's
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at
midnight.

The great bell of Saint Paul's was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set
forth on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches
of road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was
usually performed a good two hours earlier.

"What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry," said Mr. Lorry, "to
bring the dead out of their graves."

"I never see the night myself, master--nor yet I don't expect to--what
would do that," answered Jerry.

"Good night, Mr. Carton," said the man of business. "Good night, Mr.
Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!"

Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar,
bearing down upon them, too.




VII. Monseigneur in Town


Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many
things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather
rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so
much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four
strong men besides the Cook.

Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and the
Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his
pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to
conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur's lips. One lacquey carried
the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second, milled and frothed
the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function;
a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of the two gold
watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for Monseigneur to
dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high
place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have been the blot upon
his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three
men; he must have died of two.

Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the Comedy
and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at
a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so
impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy and the Grand Opera had far
more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and
state secrets, than the needs of all France. A happy circumstance
for France, as the like always is for all countries similarly
favoured!--always was for England (by way of example), in the regretted
days of the merry Stuart who sold it.

Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business, which
was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go
his way--tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and
particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that the world
was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the original
by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: "The earth and the fulness
thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur."

Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into
his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both classes of
affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to finances
public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of them, and
must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to finances
private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur, after
generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane with
a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in the outer
rooms, much prostrated before by mankind--always excepting superior
mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife included, looked
down upon him with the loftiest contempt.

A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in his
stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and
forage where he could, the Farmer-General--howsoever his matrimonial
relations conduced to social morality--was at least the greatest reality
among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur that day.

For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with
every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any
reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have
been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers
destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship;
civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the
worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives;
all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in
pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which
anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the
score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur or the State,
yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or with lives
passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end, were
no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies
for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon their courtly
patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors who had
discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the
State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to
root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this
wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time--and has been
since--to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural
subject of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of
exhaustion, at the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various
notabilities left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies
among the assembled devotees of Monseigneur--forming a goodly half
of the polite company--would have found it hard to discover among
the angels of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and
appearance, owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of
bringing a troublesome creature into this world--which does not go far
towards the realisation of the name of mother--there was no such thing
known to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close,
and brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty.

The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance
upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional
people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving in them that
things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising way of setting
them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of a fantastic
sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within themselves
whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on the
spot--thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the
Future, for Monseigneur's guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
jargon about "the Centre of Truth:" holding that Man had got out of the
Centre of Truth--which did not need much demonstration--but had not got
out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying out of
the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre,
by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on--and it did a world of good which never
became manifest.

But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only been
ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been eternally
correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair, such
delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant
swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell, would
surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen
of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they
languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his devouring hunger far away.

Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all
things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through
Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals
of Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball
descended to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was
required to officiate "frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps,
and white silk stockings." At the gallows and the wheel--the axe was a
rarity--Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call
him, presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at
Monseigneur's reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year
of our Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled
hangman, powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would
see the very stars out!

Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his
chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and
fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in
body and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven--which may have
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur never
troubled it.

Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on one
happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably
passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference of
Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in due
course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more.

The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out.

"I devote you," said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, "to the Devil!"

With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the
dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.

He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and
with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every
feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top
of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little
change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing
colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted
by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of
treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with
attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the
line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much
too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a
handsome face, and a remarkable one.

Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and
drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had
stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer
in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable
to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and
often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were
charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no
check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had
sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age,
that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician
custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a
barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a second
time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches were
left to get out of their difficulties as they could.

With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of
consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage
dashed through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming
before it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of
its way. At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its
wheels came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a
number of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.

But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not have
stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their wounded
behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down in a hurry,
and there were twenty hands at the horses' bridles.

"What has gone wrong?" said Monsieur, calmly looking out.

A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of
the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was
down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.

"Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!" said a ragged and submissive man, "it is
a child."

"Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?"

"Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes."

The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was,
into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly
got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the
Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt.

"Killed!" shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at
their length above his head, and staring at him. "Dead!"

The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was
nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness
and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the
people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they
remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat
and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes
over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes.

He took out his purse.

"It is extraordinary to me," said he, "that you people cannot take care
of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in
the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give
him that."

He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The
tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, "Dead!"

He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest
made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder,
sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were
stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They
were as silent, however, as the men.

"I know all, I know all," said the last comer. "Be a brave man, my
Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to
live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour
as happily?"

"You are a philosopher, you there," said the Marquis, smiling. "How do
they call you?"

"They call me Defarge."

"Of what trade?"

"Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine."

"Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine," said the Marquis,
throwing him another gold coin, "and spend it as you will. The horses
there; are they right?"

Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the
Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the
air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had
paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly
disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.

"Hold!" said Monsieur the Marquis. "Hold the horses! Who threw that?"

He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a
moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.

"You dogs!" said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front,
except as to the spots on his nose: "I would ride over any of you very
willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal
threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he
should be crushed under the wheels."

So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience of
what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not
a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men, not one.
But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the
Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his
contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he
leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word "Go on!"

He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking
on for hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the
spectacle, and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through
which they peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and
bidden himself away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle
while it lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running
of the water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball--when the one woman who
had stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness
of Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran
into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule,
time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together
in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all
things ran their course.




VIII. Monseigneur in the Country


A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent
tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected
disposition to give up, and wither away.

Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been
lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up
a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was
no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting
sun.

The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. "It will
die out," said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, "directly."

In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow
left when the drag was taken off.

But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a
church-tower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a
fortress on it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects
as the night drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was
coming near home.

The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor
tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor
fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All
its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors,
shredding spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the
fountain, washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of
the earth that could be eaten. Expressive signs of what made them poor,
were not wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax
for the lord, tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be
paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until
the wonder was, that there was any village left unswallowed.

Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and women,
their choice on earth was stated in the prospect--Life on the lowest
terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the mill;
or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.

Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions'
whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening air, as
if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up in
his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow
sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the
meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years.

Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before
Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces
drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender
of the roads joined the group.

"Bring me hither that fellow!" said the Marquis to the courier.

The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round
to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.

"I passed you on the road?"

"Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the road."

"Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?"

"Monseigneur, it is true."

"What did you look at, so fixedly?"

"Monseigneur, I looked at the man."

He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.

"What man, pig? And why look there?"

"Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe--the drag."

"Who?" demanded the traveller.

"Monseigneur, the man."

"May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man? You
know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?"

"Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of
all the days of my life, I never saw him."

"Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?"

"With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur.
His head hanging over--like this!"

He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his
face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered
himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.

"What was he like?"

"Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!"

The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all
eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience.

"Truly, you did well," said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such
vermin were not to ruffle him, "to see a thief accompanying my carriage,
and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur
Gabelle!"

Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary
united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this
examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an
official manner.

"Bah! Go aside!" said Monsieur Gabelle.

"Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village
to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle."

"Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders."

"Did he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?"

The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some
half-dozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and
presented him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.

"Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?"

"Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first, as
a person plunges into the river."

"See to it, Gabelle. Go on!"

The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or
they might not have been so fortunate.

The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up the
rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the many
sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand gossamer
gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended the
points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses; the
courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dull distance.

At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground,
with a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor
figure in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had
studied the figure from the life--his own life, maybe--for it was
dreadfully spare and thin.

To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and
presented herself at the carriage-door.

"It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition."

With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out.

"How, then! What is it? Always petitions!"

"Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester."

"What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He
cannot pay something?"

"He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead."

"Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?"

"Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor
grass."

"Well?"

"Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?"

"Again, well?"

She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate
grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together
with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly,
caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to
feel the appealing touch.

"Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of
want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want."

"Again, well? Can I feed them?"

"Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is,
that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed
over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly
forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I
shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they
are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want. Monseigneur!
Monseigneur!"

The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken into
a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left far
behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him and
his chateau.

The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose, as
the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the aid
of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon his
man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished.

The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging trees,
was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow was exchanged
for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and the great door
of his chateau was opened to him.

"Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?"

"Monseigneur, not yet."




IX. The Gorgon's Head


It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of
staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony
business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and
stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in
all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was
finished, two centuries ago.

Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau
preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness
to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being
in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none,
save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of
those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then
heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.

The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a
hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase;
grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a
peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord
was angry.

Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night,
Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up
the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him
to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two
others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon
the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries
befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country.
The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break--the fourteenth Louis--was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France.

A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau's four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.

"My nephew," said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation; "they
said he was not arrived."

Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.

"Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave the
table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour."

In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone to his
sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and
he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux to his
lips, when he put it down.

"What is that?" he calmly asked, looking with attention at the
horizontal lines of black and stone colour.

"Monseigneur? That?"

"Outside the blinds. Open the blinds."

It was done.

"Well?"

"Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
here."

The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out into
the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking round
for instructions.

"Good," said the imperturbable master. "Close them again."

That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He was
half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his hand,
hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to the
front of the chateau.

"Ask who is arrived."

It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues behind
Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the distance
rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on the road.
He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.

He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he came.
He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.

Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
hands.

"You left Paris yesterday, sir?" he said to Monseigneur, as he took his
seat at table.

"Yesterday. And you?"

"I come direct."

"From London?"

"Yes."

"You have been a long time coming," said the Marquis, with a smile.

"On the contrary; I come direct."

"Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey."

"I have been detained by"--the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer--"various business."

"Without doubt," said the polished uncle.

So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them.
When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew,
looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a
fine mask, opened a conversation.

"I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me."

"Not to death," said the uncle; "it is not necessary to say, to death."

"I doubt, sir," returned the nephew, "whether, if it had carried me to
the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there."

The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight
lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a
graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good
breeding that it was not reassuring.

"Indeed, sir," pursued the nephew, "for anything I know, you may have
expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious
circumstances that surrounded me."

"No, no, no," said the uncle, pleasantly.

"But, however that may be," resumed the nephew, glancing at him with
deep distrust, "I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means,
and would know no scruple as to means."

"My friend, I told you so," said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the
two marks. "Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago."

"I recall it."

"Thank you," said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed.

His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical
instrument.

"In effect, sir," pursued the nephew, "I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here."

"I do not quite understand," returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
"Dare I ask you to explain?"

"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not
been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would
have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."

"It is possible," said the uncle, with great calmness. "For the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!"

"I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed the nephew.

"I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined
politeness; "I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for
consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence
your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say,
at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle
aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that
might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest
and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted
(comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such
things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right
of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such
dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom),
one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing
some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter--_his_ daughter? We have
lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the
assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as
to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very
bad!"

The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.

"We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the modern
time also," said the nephew, gloomily, "that I believe our name to be
more detested than any name in France."

"Let us hope so," said the uncle. "Detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low."

"There is not," pursued the nephew, in his former tone, "a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery."

"A compliment," said the Marquis, "to the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!" And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs.

But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes
thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness,
and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of
indifference.

"Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear
and slavery, my friend," observed the Marquis, "will keep the dogs
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof," looking up to it, "shuts
out the sky."

That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the
chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from
the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof
he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new
way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead
was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.

"Meanwhile," said the Marquis, "I will preserve the honour and repose
of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?"

"A moment more."

"An hour, if you please."

"Sir," said the nephew, "we have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits
of wrong."

"_We_ have done wrong?" repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile,
and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.

"Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much account
to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father's time, we did
a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came between us and
our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of my father's time,
when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father's twin-brother, joint
inheritor, and next successor, from himself?"

"Death has done that!" said the Marquis.

"And has left me," answered the nephew, "bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to
execute the last request of my dear mother's lips, and obey the last
look of my dear mother's eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to
redress; and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain."

"Seeking them from me, my nephew," said the Marquis, touching him on the
breast with his forefinger--they were now standing by the hearth--"you
will for ever seek them in vain, be assured."

Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was
cruelly, craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking
quietly at his nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he
touched him on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of
a small sword, with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the
body, and said,

"My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived."

When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put his
box in his pocket.

"Better to be a rational creature," he added then, after ringing a small
bell on the table, "and accept your natural destiny. But you are lost,
Monsieur Charles, I see."

"This property and France are lost to me," said the nephew, sadly; "I
renounce them."

"Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It
is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?"

"I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow--"

"Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable."

"--or twenty years hence--"

"You do me too much honour," said the Marquis; "still, I prefer that
supposition."

"--I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little to
relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!"

"Hah!" said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.

"To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity,
under the sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste,
mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness,
and suffering."

"Hah!" said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.

"If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better
qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the
weight that drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave
it and who have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in
another generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse
on it, and on all this land."

"And you?" said the uncle. "Forgive my curiosity; do you, under your new
philosophy, graciously intend to live?"

"I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at
their backs, may have to do some day--work."

"In England, for example?"

"Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other."

The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to be
lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication. The
Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet.

"England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there," he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile.

"I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I may
be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge."

"They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?"

"Yes."

"With a daughter?"

"Yes."

"Yes," said the Marquis. "You are fatigued. Good night!"

As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same
time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin
straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that
looked handsomely diabolic.

"Yes," repeated the Marquis. "A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!"

It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face
outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew
looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.

"Good night!" said the uncle. "I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will," he
added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his
valet to his own bedroom.

The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his
loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still
night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no
noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose
periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just
coming on.

He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the
scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow
toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the
prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at
the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the
chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, "Dead!"

"I am cool now," said Monsieur the Marquis, "and may go to bed."

So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.

The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to
the owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures
hardly ever to say what is set down for them.

For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human,
stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and
the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and
freed.

The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard--both melting away, like the
minutes that were falling from the spring of Time--through three dark
hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light,
and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.

Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water
of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces
crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the
weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur
the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might.
At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open
mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.

Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Casement
windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth
shivering--chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely
lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the
fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men
and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows
out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church
and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter
prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot.

The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and
surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been
reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine;
now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked
round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at
doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs
pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.

All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried
figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?

What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads, already
at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day's dinner (not
much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow's while to
peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains of it
to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or
no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life,
down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the
fountain.

All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about
in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other
emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought
in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was
highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated
into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting
himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend,
and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind
a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle
(double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of
the German ballad of Leonora?

It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau.

The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added
the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.

It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the
heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:

"Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques."




X. Two Promises


More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr. Charles
Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the French
language who was conversant with French literature. In this age, he
would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read with
young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study of a
living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste for
its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides, in
sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters were not
at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that were
to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson's ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a
tutor, whose attainments made the student's way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became
known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with the
circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest.
So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.

In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold, nor
to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation, he
would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it, and
did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.

A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
London.

Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a
woman.

He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the
mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so
much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.

That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.

He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

"Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due."

"I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter," he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. "Miss
Manette--"

"Is well," said the Doctor, as he stopped short, "and your return will
delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will
soon be home."

"Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her
being from home, to beg to speak to you."

There was a blank silence.

"Yes?" said the Doctor, with evident constraint. "Bring your chair here,
and speak on."

He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less
easy.

"I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,"
so he at length began, "for some year and a half, that I hope the topic
on which I am about to touch may not--"

He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he
had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:

"Is Lucie the topic?"

"She is."

"It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay."

"It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor
Manette!" he said deferentially.

There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:

"I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it."

His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.

"Shall I go on, sir?"

Another blank.

"Yes, go on."

"You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly
I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and
the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been
laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love
her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!"

The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:

"Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!"

His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles
Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
so received it, and remained silent.

"I ask your pardon," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. "I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it."

He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:

"Have you spoken to Lucie?"

"No."

"Nor written?"

"Never."

"It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is
to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you."

He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.

"I know," said Darnay, respectfully, "how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so
belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it
can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there
is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home."

Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.

"Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you
with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as
long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!"

"I believe it," answered her father, mournfully. "I have thought so
before now. I believe it."

"But, do not believe," said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice
struck with a reproachful sound, "that if my fortune were so cast as
that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time
put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a
word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I
should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at
a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not
now touch this honoured hand."

He laid his own upon it as he spoke.

"No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like
you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like
you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide
with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to
come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be."

His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.

"You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have
you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?"

"None. As yet, none."

"Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?"

"Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow."

"Do you seek any guidance from me?"

"I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it
in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some."

"Do you seek any promise from me?"

"I do seek that."

"What is it?"

"I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I
could retain no place in it against her love for her father."

"If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?"

"I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason,
Doctor Manette," said Darnay, modestly but firmly, "I would not ask that
word, to save my life."

"I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart."

"May I ask, sir, if you think she is--" As he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest.

"Is sought by any other suitor?"

"It is what I meant to say."

Her father considered a little before he answered:

"You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these."

"Or both," said Darnay.

"I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want
a promise from me. Tell me what it is."

"It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own
part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will
bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you
may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately."

"I give the promise," said the Doctor, "without any condition. I believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you.
If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--"

The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
the Doctor spoke:

"--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk."

So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.

"You said something to me," said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile.
"What was it you said to me?"

He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a
condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:

"Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my
part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is
not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and
why I am in England."

"Stop!" said the Doctor of Beauvais.

"I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no
secret from you."

"Stop!"

For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.

"Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you
promise?"

"Willingly.

"Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!"

It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty.

"My father!" she called to him. "Father dear!"

Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, "What shall I do! What shall I do!"

Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down
together for a long time.

She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He
slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished
work, were all as usual.




XI. A Companion Picture


"Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; "mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you."

Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before,
and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making
a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in
of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.

Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much
application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him
through the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded
the towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.

"Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?" said Stryver the portly, with
his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he lay on
his back.

"I am."

"Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry."

"_Do_ you?"

"Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?"

"I don't feel disposed to say much. Who is she?"

"Guess."

"Do I know her?"

"Guess."

"I am not going to guess, at five o'clock in the morning, with my brains
frying and sputtering in my head. If you want me to guess, you must ask
me to dinner."

"Well then, I'll tell you," said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture. "Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog."

"And you," returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, "are such a
sensitive and poetical spirit--"

"Come!" rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, "though I don't prefer
any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better), still
I am a tenderer sort of fellow than _you_."

"You are a luckier, if you mean that."

"I don't mean that. I mean I am a man of more--more--"

"Say gallantry, while you are about it," suggested Carton.

"Well! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man," said Stryver,
inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, "who cares more to
be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how
to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do."

"Go on," said Sydney Carton.

"No; but before I go on," said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying
way, "I'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house
as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your
moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and
hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you,
Sydney!"

"It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to
be ashamed of anything," returned Sydney; "you ought to be much obliged
to me."

"You shall not get off in that way," rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; "no, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you
to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned
fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow."

Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.

"Look at me!" said Stryver, squaring himself; "I have less need to make
myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances.
Why do I do it?"

"I never saw you do it yet," muttered Carton.

"I do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on."

"You don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,"
answered Carton, with a careless air; "I wish you would keep to that. As
to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?"

He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.

"You have no business to be incorrigible," was his friend's answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.

"I have no business to be, at all, that I know of," said Sydney Carton.
"Who is the lady?"

"Now, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable,
Sydney," said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness
for the disclosure he was about to make, "because I know you don't mean
half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I
make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to
me in slighting terms."

"I did?"

"Certainly; and in these chambers."

Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend;
drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.

"You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young
lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or
delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a
little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I
think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of
a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music."

Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.

"Now you know all about it, Syd," said Mr. Stryver. "I don't care about
fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind to
please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her,
but she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?"

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I be
astonished?"

"You approve?"

Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, "Why should I not approve?"

"Well!" said his friend Stryver, "you take it more easily than I fancied
you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would
be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your
ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had
enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I
feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel
that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me
credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to
say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you
know; you really are in a bad way. You don't know the value of money,
you live hard, you'll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor;
you really ought to think about a nurse."

The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look twice as
big as he was, and four times as offensive.

"Now, let me recommend you," pursued Stryver, "to look it in the face.
I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the face,
you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care of
you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women's society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property--somebody in the landlady way,
or lodging-letting way--and marry her, against a rainy day. That's the
kind of thing for _you_. Now think of it, Sydney."

"I'll think of it," said Sydney.




XII. The Fellow of Delicacy


Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of good
fortune on the Doctor's daughter, resolved to make her happiness known
to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some mental
debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would be as
well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange
at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.

As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but clearly
saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial worldly
grounds--the only grounds ever worth taking into account--it was a
plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for the
plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for
the defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to
consider. After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer
case could be.

Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal
proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing, to
Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.

Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple,
while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it.
Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet
on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way
along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have
seen how safe and strong he was.

His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and
knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr.
Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness
of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle
in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient
cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr.
Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.

"Halloa!" said Mr. Stryver. "How do you do? I hope you are well!"

It was Stryver's grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for any
place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if
the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.

The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances, "How do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do
you do, sir?" and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner
of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook
hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a
self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.

"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?" asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character.

"Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word."

"Oh indeed!" said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed
to the House afar off.

"I am going," said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: "I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry."

"Oh dear me!" cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.

"Oh dear me, sir?" repeated Stryver, drawing back. "Oh dear you, sir?
What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?"

"My meaning," answered the man of business, "is, of course, friendly and
appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short,
my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr.
Stryver--" Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest
manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally,
"you know there really is so much too much of you!"

"Well!" said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, "if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!"

Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that
end, and bit the feather of a pen.

"D--n it all, sir!" said Stryver, staring at him, "am I not eligible?"

"Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!" said Mr. Lorry. "If you say
eligible, you are eligible."

"Am I not prosperous?" asked Stryver.

"Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous," said Mr. Lorry.

"And advancing?"

"If you come to advancing you know," said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be
able to make another admission, "nobody can doubt that."

"Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?" demanded Stryver,
perceptibly crestfallen.

"Well! I--Were you going there now?" asked Mr. Lorry.

"Straight!" said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.

"Then I think I wouldn't, if I was you."

"Why?" said Stryver. "Now, I'll put you in a corner," forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. "You are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?"

"Because," said Mr. Lorry, "I wouldn't go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed."

"D--n _me_!" cried Stryver, "but this beats everything."

Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.

"Here's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_
a Bank," said Stryver; "and having summed up three leading reasons for
complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his
head on!" Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.

"When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and
when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of
causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young
lady, my good sir," said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, "the
young lady. The young lady goes before all."

"Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry," said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, "that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at
present in question is a mincing Fool?"

"Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver," said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, "that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose
taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could
not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at
this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my
mind."

The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's
blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry;
Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in
no better state now it was his turn.

"That is what I mean to tell you, sir," said Mr. Lorry. "Pray let there
be no mistake about it."

Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood
hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the
toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:

"This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not
to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench
bar?"

"Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?"

"Yes, I do."

"Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly."

"And all I can say of it is," laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, "that
this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come."

"Now understand me," pursued Mr. Lorry. "As a man of business, I am
not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and
of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have
spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I
may not be right?"

"Not I!" said Stryver, whistling. "I can't undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense
in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's
new to me, but you are right, I dare say."

"What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And
understand me, sir," said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, "I
will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any
gentleman breathing."

"There! I beg your pardon!" said Stryver.

"Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be
painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor
Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very
painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You
know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with
the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you
in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a
little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon
it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its
soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?"

"How long would you keep me in town?"

"Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards."

"Then I say yes," said Stryver: "I won't go up there now, I am not so
hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning."

Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it
bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength
of the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were
always seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly
believed, when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in
the empty office until they bowed another customer in.

The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not have
gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground than
moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had to
swallow, he got it down. "And now," said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, "my way
out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong."

It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. "You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady," said Mr.
Stryver; "I'll do that for you."

Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o'clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.

"Well!" said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. "I have been to
Soho."

"To Soho?" repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. "Oh, to be sure! What am I
thinking of!"

"And I have no doubt," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was right in the
conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my
advice."

"I assure you," returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, "that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's
account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it."

"I don't understand you," said Mr. Lorry.

"I dare say not," rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and
final way; "no matter, no matter."

"But it does matter," Mr. Lorry urged.

"No it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was
sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is
not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is
done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have
repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish
aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am
glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing
for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could
have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not
proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means
certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to
that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and
giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you
will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I tell you,
I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own account.
And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to sound you,
and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady better than I do;
you were right, it never would have done."

Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of
showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head.
"Make the best of it, my dear sir," said Stryver; "say no more about it;
thank you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!"

Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr. Stryver
was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.




XIII. The Fellow of No Delicacy


If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When he
cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.

And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that house,
and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a night
he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought no
transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary
figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture
in spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time
brought some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable,
into his mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known
him more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.

On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that "he had thought better of that marrying matter") had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod
those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became
animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention,
they took him to the Doctor's door.

He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had
never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little
embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at
his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed
a change in it.

"I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!"

"No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health. What
is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?"

"Is it not--forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips--a pity to
live no better life?"

"God knows it is a shame!"

"Then why not change it?"

Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see that
there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:

"It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall
sink lower, and be worse."

He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand. The
table trembled in the silence that followed.

She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew her to
be so, without looking at her, and said:

"Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge of
what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?"

"If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!"

"God bless you for your sweet compassion!"

He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.

"Don't be afraid to hear me. Don't shrink from anything I say. I am like
one who died young. All my life might have been."

"No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I am
sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself."

"Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better--although in the
mystery of my own wretched heart I know better--I shall never forget
it!"

She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed despair
of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could have
been holden.

"If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the
love of the man you see before yourself--flung away, wasted, drunken,
poor creature of misuse as you know him to be--he would have been
conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he would
bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight you,
disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you can have
no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that it cannot
be."

"Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall
you--forgive me again!--to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
confidence? I know this is a confidence," she modestly said, after a
little hesitation, and in earnest tears, "I know you would say this to
no one else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?"

He shook his head.

"To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a very
little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know that
you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have not
been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and of this
home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I thought had
died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a remorse that
I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard whispers from
old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were silent for ever. I
have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off
sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all
a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down,
but I wish you to know that you inspired it."

"Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!"

"No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the
weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me,
heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away."

"Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy
than you were before you knew me--"

"Don't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse."

"Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?"

"The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come
here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life,
the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world;
and that there was something left in me at this time which you could
deplore and pity."

"Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with
all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!"

"Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself,
and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let
me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life
was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?"

"If that will be a consolation to you, yes."

"Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?"

"Mr. Carton," she answered, after an agitated pause, "the secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it."

"Thank you. And again, God bless you."

He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.

"Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it
again. If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In
the hour of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance--and
shall thank and bless you for it--that my last avowal of myself was made
to you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried
in your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!"

He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was so
sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every day kept
down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for him as he
stood looking back at her.

"Be comforted!" he said, "I am not worth such feeling, Miss Manette. An
hour or two hence, and the low companions and low habits that I scorn
but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as those, than any
wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But, within myself, I
shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though outwardly I shall be
what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make
to you, is, that you will believe this of me."

"I will, Mr. Carton."

"My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve
you of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to say
it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to
you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would
embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold
me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one
thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new
ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly
and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever
grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a
happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright
beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is
a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!"

He said, "Farewell!" said a last "God bless you!" and left her.




XIV. The Honest Tradesman


To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in
Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and
variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit
upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and
not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending
westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun,
both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where
the sun goes down!

With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams,
like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty
watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever
running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind,
since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid
women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from
Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such
companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed
to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to
have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from
the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent
purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.

Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in
the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.

It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been "flopping" in some pointed manner, when an
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.

"Young Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, "it's a
buryin'."

"Hooroar, father!" cried Young Jerry.

The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.

"What d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey
to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for
_me_!" said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. "Him and his hooroars! Don't
let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye
hear?"

"I warn't doing no harm," Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.

"Drop it then," said Mr. Cruncher; "I won't have none of _your_ no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd."

His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling and hissing
round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which mourning coach
there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were
considered essential to the dignity of the position. The position
appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble
surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at him, and
incessantly groaning and calling out: "Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha! Spies!"
with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.

Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher; he
always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral passed
Tellson's. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance
excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him:

"What is it, brother? What's it about?"

"_I_ don't know," said the man. "Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!"

He asked another man. "Who is it?"

"_I_ don't know," returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the
greatest ardour, "Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!"

At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled
against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the
funeral of one Roger Cly.

"Was He a spy?" asked Mr. Cruncher.

"Old Bailey spy," returned his informant. "Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey
Spi--i--ies!"

"Why, to be sure!" exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had
assisted. "I've seen him. Dead, is he?"

"Dead as mutton," returned the other, "and can't be too dead. Have 'em
out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!"

The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea,
that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the
suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles
so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.

These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with great
enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for a
crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much dreaded.
They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of Tellson's, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.

The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the
hearse--advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside him, under
close inspection, for the purpose--and with a pieman, also attended
by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bear-leader, a
popular street character of the time, was impressed as an additional
ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand; and his
bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking air to
that part of the procession in which he walked.

Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and
highly to its own satisfaction.

The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of
providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter
genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near
the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy
and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had
been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm
the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were
coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps
the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual
progress of a mob.

Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a
neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and
maturely considering the spot.

"Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
"you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young 'un and a straight made 'un."

Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all
amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent
man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon
his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back.

Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No
job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the
usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea.

"Now, I tell you where it is!" said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. "If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I
shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you
for it just the same as if I seen you do it."

The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.

"Why, you're at it afore my face!" said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.

"I am saying nothing."

"Well, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate.
You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether."

"Yes, Jerry."

"Yes, Jerry," repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. "Ah! It _is_
yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry."

Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations,
but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general
ironical dissatisfaction.

"You and your yes, Jerry," said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his
bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer. "Ah! I think so. I believe you."

"You are going out to-night?" asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.

"Yes, I am."

"May I go with you, father?" asked his son, briskly.

"No, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's
where I'm going to. Going a fishing."

"Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?"

"Never you mind."

"Shall you bring any fish home, father?"

"If I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow," returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; "that's questions enough for you; I ain't a
going out, till you've been long abed."

He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a
most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in
conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than
he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest
person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an
honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a
professed unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.

"And mind you!" said Mr. Cruncher. "No games to-morrow! If I, as a
honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two, none
of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring
on water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don't. _I_'m your Rome, you know."

Then he began grumbling again:

"With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I don't
know how scarce you mayn't make the wittles and drink here, by your
flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he _is_
your'n, ain't he? He's as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother's first duty is to blow her boy out?"

This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother to
perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal
function so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.

Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young Jerry
was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night with
solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly one
o'clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his chair,
took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and brought
forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain, and other
fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about him
in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.

Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went to
bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the
door stood ajar all night.

Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father's honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his
honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had not
gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton, and
the two trudged on together.

Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out upon a
lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here--and that so silently,
that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have supposed the
second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden, split
himself into two.

The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was a low
brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of bank and
wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of which
the wall--there, risen to some eight or ten feet high--formed one side.
Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object that
Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little--listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.

It was now Young Jerry's turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking
in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank grass!
and all the gravestones in the churchyard--it was a large churchyard
that they were in--looking on like ghosts in white, while the church
tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They did not
creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they began to
fish.

They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew.
Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful
striking of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off,
with his hair as stiff as his father's.

But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters, not
only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again. They
were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was a
screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures were
strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away the
earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew what
it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent about to
wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight, that he
made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or more.

He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than breath,
it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable
to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt
upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him
and hopping on at his side--perhaps taking his arm--it was a pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it
was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy's Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road,
and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was
incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy
got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then
it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every
stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep.

From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after
daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry
inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the
ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the
bed.

"I told you I would," said Mr. Cruncher, "and I did."

"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!" his wife implored.

"You oppose yourself to the profit of the business," said Jerry, "and me
and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't
you?"

"I try to be a good wife, Jerry," the poor woman protested, with tears.

"Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?"

"You hadn't taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry."

"It's enough for you," retorted Mr. Cruncher, "to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations
when he took to his trade or when he didn't. A honouring and obeying
wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious
woman? If you're a religious woman, give me a irreligious one! You have
no more nat'ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames river has
of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you."

The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in
the honest tradesman's kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and lying down
at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him lying on
his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his son lay
down too, and fell asleep again.

There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid
by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling.

Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side
along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry
from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and
solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning.

"Father," said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep
at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: "what's a
Resurrection-Man?"

Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, "How
should I know?"

"I thought you knowed everything, father," said the artless boy.

"Hem! Well," returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his
hat to give his spikes free play, "he's a tradesman."

"What's his goods, father?" asked the brisk Young Jerry.

"His goods," said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, "is a
branch of Scientific goods."

"Persons' bodies, ain't it, father?" asked the lively boy.

"I believe it is something of that sort," said Mr. Cruncher.

"Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite
growed up!"

Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way.
"It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop
your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and
there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit
for." As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance,
to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to
himself: "Jerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will
yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!"




XV. Knitting


There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over
measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best
of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that
he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No
vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur
Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in
the dregs of it.

This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been
early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early
brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and
slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could
not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These
were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat,
and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy
looks.

Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop
was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the
threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see
only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of
wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced
and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.

A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's
gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built
towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops
of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve
with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible
a long way off.

Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was
high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under
his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a
mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered
the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast
of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and
flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had
followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though
the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.

"Good day, gentlemen!" said Monsieur Defarge.

It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of "Good day!"

"It is bad weather, gentlemen," said Defarge, shaking his head.

Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down
their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out.

"My wife," said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: "I have
travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris.
He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
drink, my wife!"

A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the
mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company,
and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark
bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near
Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out.

Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.

"Have you finished your repast, friend?" he asked, in due season.

"Yes, thank you."

"Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel."

Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a
courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the
staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man
sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.

No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had
gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired
man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at
him through the chinks in the wall.

Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:

"Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness
encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!"

The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with
it, and said, "Where shall I commence, monsieur?"

"Commence," was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, "at the
commencement."

"I saw him then, messieurs," began the mender of roads, "a year ago this
running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the
chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun
going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he
hanging by the chain--like this."

Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which
he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village
during a whole year.

Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?

"Never," answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.

Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?

"By his tall figure," said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose. "When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre.'"

"You should have said, short as a dwarf," returned Jacques Two.

"But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he
confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not
offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger,
standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!'
My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing."

"He is right there, Jacques," murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted. "Go on!"

"Good!" said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. "The tall man
is lost, and he is sought--how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?"

"No matter, the number," said Defarge. "He is well hidden, but at last
he is unluckily found. Go on!"

"I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about to
go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down in the
village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and see
coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound--tied to his sides--like this!"

With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.

"I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any
spectacle is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I
see no more than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and
that they are almost black to my sight--except on the side of the sun
going to bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that
their long shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the
road, and are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants.
Also, I see that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves
with them as they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near
to me, I recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would
be well content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as
on the evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!"

He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.

"I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does not
show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know it, with
our eyes. 'Come on!' says the chief of that company, pointing to the
village, 'bring him fast to his tomb!' and they bring him faster. I
follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his wooden
shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame, and
consequently slow, they drive him with their guns--like this!"

He imitated the action of a man's being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets.

"As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with dust,
but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring him into
the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the mill,
and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him--like this!"

He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding
snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect by
opening it again, Defarge said, "Go on, Jacques."

"All the village," pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a low
voice, "withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of it,
except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder, eating
my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison, on
my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a lofty
iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has no
hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man."

Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of all
of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman's story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One
and Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on
his hand, and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally
intent, on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding
over the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge
standing between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the
light of the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to
him.

"Go on, Jacques," said Defarge.

"He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a
distance, at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work
of the day is achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all
faces are turned towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards
the posting-house; now, they are turned towards the prison. They
whisper at the fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be
executed; they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing
that he was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say
that a petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know?
It is possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no."

"Listen then, Jacques," Number One of that name sternly interposed.
"Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen. All here,
yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street,
sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the
hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in
his hand."

"And once again listen, Jacques!" said the kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a
strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither
food nor drink; "the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner,
and struck him blows. You hear?"

"I hear, messieurs."

"Go on then," said Defarge.

"Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain," resumed the
countryman, "that he is brought down into our country to be executed on
the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper
that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the
father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a
parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed
with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds
which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be
poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally,
that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man
says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on
the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies?
I am not a scholar."

"Listen once again then, Jacques!" said the man with the restless hand
and the craving air. "The name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was
all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and
nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than
the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager
attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done--why, how old are you?"

"Thirty-five," said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.

"It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might have seen
it."

"Enough!" said Defarge, with grim impatience. "Long live the Devil! Go
on."

"Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing else;
even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street.
Workmen dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by
the fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the
water."

The mender of roads looked _through_ rather than _at_ the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.

"All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst
of many soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is
a gag--tied so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he
laughed." He suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs,
from the corners of his mouth to his ears. "On the top of the gallows is
fixed the knife, blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged
there forty feet high--and is left hanging, poisoning the water."

They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his face,
on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle.

"It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children draw
water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under it, have
I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was going to
bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across the church,
across the mill, across the prison--seemed to strike across the earth,
messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!"

The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.

"That's all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and now
walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And here
you see me!"

After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, "Good! You have acted
and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?"

"Very willingly," said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted to the
top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.

The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came back to
the garret.

"How say you, Jacques?" demanded Number One. "To be registered?"

"To be registered, as doomed to destruction," returned Defarge.

"Magnificent!" croaked the man with the craving.

"The chateau, and all the race?" inquired the first.

"The chateau and all the race," returned Defarge. "Extermination."

The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, "Magnificent!" and began
gnawing another finger.

"Are you sure," asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, "that no embarrassment
can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without doubt it is
safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall we always
be able to decipher it--or, I ought to say, will she?"

"Jacques," returned Defarge, drawing himself up, "if madame my wife
undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not lose
a word of it--not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and her
own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge."

There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man who
hungered, asked: "Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so. He is
very simple; is he not a little dangerous?"

"He knows nothing," said Defarge; "at least nothing more than would
easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge myself
with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set him
on his road. He wishes to see the fine world--the King, the Queen, and
Court; let him see them on Sunday."

"What?" exclaimed the hungry man, staring. "Is it a good sign, that he
wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?"

"Jacques," said Defarge; "judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish her
to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day."

Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already
dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on the
pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was soon
asleep.

Worse quarters than Defarge's wine-shop, could easily have been found
in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious
dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life was very
new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter, so expressly
unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to perceive that
his being there had any connection with anything below the surface, that
he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted on her. For, he
contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee what that lady
might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should take it
into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen him do a
murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go through
with it until the play was played out.

Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted
(though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany monsieur
and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to have
madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the
afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to
see the carriage of the King and Queen.

"You work hard, madame," said a man near her.

"Yes," answered Madame Defarge; "I have a good deal to do."

"What do you make, madame?"

"Many things."

"For instance--"

"For instance," returned Madame Defarge, composedly, "shrouds."

The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the mender
of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close
and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was
fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King
and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by the
shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary
intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen,
Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of
ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards,
terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye,
more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept
with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three
hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company,
and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him
from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to
pieces.

"Bravo!" said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a
patron; "you are a good boy!"

The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of
having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.

"You are the fellow we want," said Defarge, in his ear; "you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended."

"Hey!" cried the mender of roads, reflectively; "that's true."

"These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would
stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than
in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath
tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much."

Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.

"As to you," said she, "you would shout and shed tears for anything, if
it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?"

"Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment."

"If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to
pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would
pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?"

"Truly yes, madame."

"Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?"

"It is true, madame."

"You have seen both dolls and birds to-day," said Madame Defarge, with
a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent;
"now, go home!"




XVI. Still Knitting


Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to
the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now,
for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village
scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead
stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and
terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that
the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the
village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that
when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to
faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled
up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel
look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever. In the
stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder
was done, two fine dints were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which
everybody recognised, and which nobody had seen of old; and on the
scarce occasions when two or three ragged peasants emerged from the
crowd to take a hurried peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a
skinny finger would not have pointed to it for a minute, before they all
started away among the moss and leaves, like the more fortunate hares
who could find a living there.

Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well--thousands of acres
of land--a whole province of France--all France itself--lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling
star. And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse
the manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in
the feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every
vice and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.

The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their
journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier
guardhouse, and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual
examination and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two
of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate
with, and affectionately embraced.

When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings,
and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his
streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:

"Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?"

"Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy
commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he
can say, but he knows of one."

"Eh well!" said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. "It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
man?"

"He is English."

"So much the better. His name?"

"Barsad," said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had
been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness.

"Barsad," repeated madame. "Good. Christian name?"

"John."

"John Barsad," repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself.
"Good. His appearance; is it known?"

"Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair;
complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face
thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore,
sinister."

"Eh my faith. It is a portrait!" said madame, laughing. "He shall be
registered to-morrow."

They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight),
and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted
the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the
stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of
her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally
dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the bowl
of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked
up and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which
condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he
walked up and down through life.

The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so foul a
neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge's olfactory sense was
by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much stronger than
it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy and aniseed. He
whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down his smoked-out pipe.

"You are fatigued," said madame, raising her glance as she knotted the
money. "There are only the usual odours."

"I am a little tired," her husband acknowledged.

"You are a little depressed, too," said madame, whose quick eyes had
never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for
him. "Oh, the men, the men!"

"But my dear!" began Defarge.

"But my dear!" repeated madame, nodding firmly; "but my dear! You are
faint of heart to-night, my dear!"

"Well, then," said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, "it _is_ a long time."

"It is a long time," repeated his wife; "and when is it not a long time?
Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule."

"It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning," said
Defarge.

"How long," demanded madame, composedly, "does it take to make and store
the lightning? Tell me."

Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that
too.

"It does not take a long time," said madame, "for an earthquake to
swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?"

"A long time, I suppose," said Defarge.

"But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not
seen or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it."

She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.

"I tell thee," said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
"that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and
coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it
is always advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world
that we know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider
the rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with
more and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you."

"My brave wife," returned Defarge, standing before her with his head
a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, "I do not question all this. But
it has lasted a long time, and it is possible--you know well, my wife,
it is possible--that it may not come, during our lives."

"Eh well! How then?" demanded madame, tying another knot, as if there
were another enemy strangled.

"Well!" said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic shrug.
"We shall not see the triumph."

"We shall have helped it," returned madame, with her extended hand in
strong action. "Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe, with all
my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if I knew
certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and still I
would--"

Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.

"Hold!" cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; "I too, my dear, will stop at nothing."

"Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your victim
and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without that.
When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for the
time with the tiger and the devil chained--not shown--yet always ready."

Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her
little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its brains
out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in a serene
manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.

Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell
dead at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!--perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.

A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge which she
felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began to pin her
rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.

It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the
wine-shop.

"Good day, madame," said the new-comer.

"Good day, monsieur."

She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
"Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black
hair, generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark,
thin, long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister
expression! Good day, one and all!"

"Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame."

Madame complied with a polite air.

"Marvellous cognac this, madame!"

It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said,
however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The
visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity
of observing the place in general.

"You knit with great skill, madame."

"I am accustomed to it."

"A pretty pattern too!"

"_You_ think so?" said madame, looking at him with a smile.

"Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?"

"Pastime," said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.

"Not for use?"

"That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well," said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, "I'll use it!"

It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be
decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of
looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away.
Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there
one left. They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open,
but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a
poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and
unimpeachable.

"_John_," thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted,
and her eyes looked at the stranger. "Stay long enough, and I shall knit
'BARSAD' before you go."

"You have a husband, madame?"

"I have."

"Children?"

"No children."

"Business seems bad?"

"Business is very bad; the people are so poor."

"Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say."

"As _you_ say," madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an
extra something into his name that boded him no good.

"Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so.
Of course."

"_I_ think?" returned madame, in a high voice. "I and my husband have
enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we
think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and
it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without
embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no."

The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did
not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.

"A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor
Gaspard!" With a sigh of great compassion.

"My faith!" returned madame, coolly and lightly, "if people use knives
for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the
price of his luxury was; he has paid the price."

"I believe," said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone
that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary
susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: "I believe there
is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor
fellow? Between ourselves."

"Is there?" asked madame, vacantly.

"Is there not?"

"--Here is my husband!" said Madame Defarge.

As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, "Good day,
Jacques!" Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.

"Good day, Jacques!" the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.

"You deceive yourself, monsieur," returned the keeper of the wine-shop.
"You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge."

"It is all the same," said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: "good
day!"

"Good day!" answered Defarge, drily.

"I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when
you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy
and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard."

"No one has told me so," said Defarge, shaking his head. "I know nothing
of it."

Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with his
hand on the back of his wife's chair, looking over that barrier at the
person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them would
have shot with the greatest satisfaction.

The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh
water, and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it
out for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over
it.

"You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I do?"
observed Defarge.

"Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested
in its miserable inhabitants."

"Hah!" muttered Defarge.

"The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls to me,"
pursued the spy, "that I have the honour of cherishing some interesting
associations with your name."

"Indeed!" said Defarge, with much indifference.

"Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic,
had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You see I am
informed of the circumstances?"

"Such is the fact, certainly," said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife's elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.

"It was to you," said the spy, "that his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat brown
monsieur; how is he called?--in a little wig--Lorry--of the bank of
Tellson and Company--over to England."

"Such is the fact," repeated Defarge.

"Very interesting remembrances!" said the spy. "I have known Doctor
Manette and his daughter, in England."

"Yes?" said Defarge.

"You don't hear much about them now?" said the spy.

"No," said Defarge.

"In effect," madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little
song, "we never hear about them. We received the news of their safe
arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held
no correspondence."

"Perfectly so, madame," replied the spy. "She is going to be married."

"Going?" echoed madame. "She was pretty enough to have been married long
ago. You English are cold, it seems to me."

"Oh! You know I am English."

"I perceive your tongue is," returned madame; "and what the tongue is, I
suppose the man is."

He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best
of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:

"Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to
one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah,
poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is
Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family."

Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no
spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.

Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say,
in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the
pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For some minutes
after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint Antoine, the
husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them, lest he should
come back.

"Can it be true," said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his wife
as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: "what he has
said of Ma'amselle Manette?"

"As he has said it," returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little, "it
is probably false. But it may be true."

"If it is--" Defarge began, and stopped.

"If it is?" repeated his wife.

"--And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph--I hope, for her
sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France."

"Her husband's destiny," said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure,
"will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end that is
to end him. That is all I know."

"But it is very strange--now, at least, is it not very strange"--said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it,
"that, after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her
husband's name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog's who has just left us?"

"Stranger things than that will happen when it does come," answered
madame. "I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are both here
for their merits; that is enough."

She rolled up her knitting when she had said those words, and presently
took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about her head.
Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable
decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for its
disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.

In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary--there were many like
her--such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still,
the stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.

But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as Madame
Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker and fiercer
among every little knot of women that she had spoken with, and left
behind.

Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration. "A
great woman," said he, "a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully
grand woman!"

Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells and
the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard, as
the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another
darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing
pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted into
thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to drown a
wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and Plenty,
Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women who sat
knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in around
a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.




XVII. One Night


Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter sat
under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.

Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last evening
for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.

"You are happy, my dear father?"

"Quite, my child."

They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.

"And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in the
love that Heaven has so blessed--my love for Charles, and Charles's love
for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by
the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and
self-reproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is--"

Even as it was, she could not command her voice.

In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is--as the light called human life is--at its coming and
its going.

"Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?"

Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, "Quite sure, my darling! More than that," he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: "my future is far brighter, Lucie,
seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever
was--without it."

"If I could hope _that_, my father!--"

"Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain
it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot
fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted--"

She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated
the word.

"--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself,
how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?"

"If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy
with you."

He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy
without Charles, having seen him; and replied:

"My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have
cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you."

It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new
sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards.

"See!" said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon.
"I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her
light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think
of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against
my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic,
that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I
could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines
with which I could intersect them." He added in his inward and pondering
manner, as he looked at the moon, "It was twenty either way, I remember,
and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in."

The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.

"I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn
child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had
been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it
was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my
imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it
was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live
to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own
will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman."

She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.

"I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married
to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a
blank."

"My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who
never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child."

"You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?"

"She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you."

"So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence
have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as
like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its
foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and
leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her
image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held
her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.
But, you understand that that was not the child I am speaking of?"

"The figure was not; the--the--image; the fancy?"

"No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense of
sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was another
and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no more than
that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness too--as you
have--but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie? Hardly, I think?
I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to understand these
perplexed distinctions."

His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from running
cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.

"In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her married
life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My picture
was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all."

"I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I."

"And she showed me her children," said the Doctor of Beauvais, "and
they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they passed
a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and looked
up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver me; I
imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such things.
But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees, and
blessed her."

"I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you bless
me as fervently to-morrow?"

"Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great
happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near the
happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us."

He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly thanked
Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they went into the
house.

There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were only
three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that Charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.

So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated.
But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.

All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his;
then, leaned over him, and looked at him.

Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but, he
covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held the
mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its quiet,
resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not to be
beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.

She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer that
she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as his
sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips once
more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him.




XVIII. Nine Days


The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr.
Lorry, and Miss Pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should
have been the bridegroom.

"And so," said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
pretty dress; "and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought
you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought
what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring
on my friend Mr. Charles!"

"You didn't mean it," remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, "and
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!"

"Really? Well; but don't cry," said the gentle Mr. Lorry.

"I am not crying," said Miss Pross; "_you_ are."

"I, my Pross?" (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her,
on occasion.)

"You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into
anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection," said
Miss Pross, "that I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till
I couldn't see it."

"I am highly gratified," said Mr. Lorry, "though, upon my honour, I
had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there
might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!"

"Not at all!" From Miss Pross.

"You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?" asked the
gentleman of that name.

"Pooh!" rejoined Miss Pross; "you were a bachelor in your cradle."

"Well!" observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, "that
seems probable, too."

"And you were cut out for a bachelor," pursued Miss Pross, "before you
were put in your cradle."

"Then, I think," said Mr. Lorry, "that I was very unhandsomely dealt
with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round
her waist, "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and
I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave
your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your
own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on
your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own."

For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the
well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright
golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and
delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.

The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles
Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they
went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face.
But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind.

He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.

Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to
breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had
mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the
door at parting.

It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms, "Take her, Charles! She is yours!"

And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
gone.

The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him a poisoned blow.

He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was
the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own
room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the
wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.

"I think," he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, "I
think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well."

It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of
Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus
into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.

"Good God!" he said, with a start. "What's that?"

Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. "O me, O me! All is
lost!" cried she, wringing her hands. "What is to be told to Ladybird?
He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!"

Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy.

"Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!"

The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he
were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again.

He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old
haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked
hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted.

Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a
shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.

"A young lady's walking shoe," he muttered, without looking up. "It
ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be."

"But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!"

He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in
his work.

"You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper
occupation. Think, dear friend!"

Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at
a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract
a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and
words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on
the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.

Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above
all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In
conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a
few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.

These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on the Doctor's case.

In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course
being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him
attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He
therefore made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson's for the
first time in his life, and took his post by the window in the same
room.

He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak
to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that
attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself always
before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had
fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.

Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on,
that first day, until it was too dark to see--worked on, half an hour
after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.
When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry rose
and said to him:

"Will you go out?"

He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

"Out?"

"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"

He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But, Mr.
Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
some misty way asking himself, "Why not?" The sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.

Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
bench and to work.

On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry
to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him.

When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:

"Dear Doctor, will you go out?"

As before, he repeated, "Out?"

"Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?"

This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer
from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the
meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had
sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he
slipped away to his bench.

The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his
heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day.
The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days,
seven days, eight days, nine days.

With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and
heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was
well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to
observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first,
was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on
his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in
the dusk of the ninth evening.




XIX. An Opinion


Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark
night.

He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had
done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door of the
Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench
and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading
at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which
Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.

Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might
not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his
friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed
as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of
which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?

It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?

Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr.
Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.

Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the
usual way, and came to breakfast.

So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those
delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe
advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken
place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to
the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid
he sought. And that aid was his own.

Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the
Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:

"My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a
very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is
very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less
so."

Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the
Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced
at his hands more than once.

"Doctor Manette," said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the
arm, "the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all,
for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette."

"If I understand," said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, "some mental
shock--?"

"Yes!"

"Be explicit," said the Doctor. "Spare no detail."

Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.

"My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock,
of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings,
the--the--as you express it--the mind. The mind. It is the case of a
shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how
long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there
are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from
which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace
himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is
the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to
be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and
great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his
stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately,
there has been," he paused and took a deep breath--"a slight relapse."

The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, "Of how long duration?"

"Nine days and nights."

"How did it show itself? I infer," glancing at his hands again, "in the
resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?"

"That is the fact."

"Now, did you ever see him," asked the Doctor, distinctly and
collectedly, though in the same low voice, "engaged in that pursuit
originally?"

"Once."

"And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all
respects--as he was then?"

"I think in all respects."

"You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?"

"No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her.
It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted."

The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, "That was very kind. That was
very thoughtful!" Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of
the two spoke for a little while.

"Now, my dear Manette," said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, "I am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it
be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come
about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been
more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine,
if I knew how.

"But I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be
able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful."

Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and
Mr. Lorry did not press him.

"I think it probable," said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort,
"that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject."

"Was it dreaded by him?" Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.

"Very much." He said it with an involuntary shudder.

"You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer's
mind, and how difficult--how almost impossible--it is, for him to force
himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him."

"Would he," asked Mr. Lorry, "be sensibly relieved if he could prevail
upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is on
him?"

"I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it--in some cases--to be quite impossible."

"Now," said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor's arm again,
after a short silence on both sides, "to what would you refer this
attack?"

"I believe," returned Doctor Manette, "that there had been a strong and
extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that
there had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations
would be recalled--say, under certain circumstances--say, on a
particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the
effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it."

"Would he remember what took place in the relapse?" asked Mr. Lorry,
with natural hesitation.

The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, "Not at all."

"Now, as to the future," hinted Mr. Lorry.

"As to the future," said the Doctor, recovering firmness, "I should have
great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon, I
should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a complicated
something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against,
and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed, I should hope that
the worst was over."

"Well, well! That's good comfort. I am thankful!" said Mr. Lorry.

"I am thankful!" repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.

"There are two other points," said Mr. Lorry, "on which I am anxious to
be instructed. I may go on?"

"You cannot do your friend a better service." The Doctor gave him his
hand.

"To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now, does
he do too much?"

"I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in
part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy
things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy
direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery."

"You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?"

"I think I am quite sure of it."

"My dear Manette, if he were overworked now--"

"My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight."

"Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment,
that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this
disorder?"

"I do not think so. I do not think," said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, "that anything but the one train of
association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some
extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has
happened, and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any
such violent sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost
believe, that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted."

He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that
confidence. He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was, and approached his second and last point. He felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning
conversation with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days, he knew that he must face it.

"The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction
so happily recovered from," said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, "we
will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by
him?"

The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground.

"He has always kept it by him," said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at
his friend. "Now, would it not be better that he should let it go?"

Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the
ground.

"You do not find it easy to advise me?" said Mr. Lorry. "I quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--" And there he
shook his head, and stopped.

"You see," said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy pause,
"it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man's mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that
occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved
his pain so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for
the perplexity of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more
practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental
torture; that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it
quite out of his reach. Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of
himself than he has ever been, and even speaks of himself with a kind
of confidence, the idea that he might need that old employment, and not
find it, gives him a sudden sense of terror, like that which one may
fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child."

He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry's
face.

"But may not--mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of business
who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings, and
bank-notes--may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of
the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not the fear go
with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to keep the
forge?"

There was another silence.

"You see, too," said the Doctor, tremulously, "it is such an old
companion."

"I would not keep it," said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he gained
in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. "I would recommend him to
sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does no good.
Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his daughter's
sake, my dear Manette!"

Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!

"In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not take
it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not there;
let him miss his old companion after an absence."

Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended. They
passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored. On the
three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.

On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by Miss Pross
carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker's bench to pieces, while
Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do destruction
and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross,
while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its
traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices in a horrible
crime.




XX. A Plea


When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to the observation of Charles Darnay.

He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard.

"Mr. Darnay," said Carton, "I wish we might be friends."

"We are already friends, I hope."

"You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don't
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either."

Charles Darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
good-fellowship, what he did mean?

"Upon my life," said Carton, smiling, "I find that easier to comprehend
in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me try. You
remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk than--than
usual?"

"I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that
you had been drinking."

"I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me, for I
always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one day,
when all days are at an end for me! Don't be alarmed; I am not going to
preach."

"I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming
to me."

"Ah!" said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved that
away. "On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number, as
you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it."

"I forgot it long ago."

"Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy to
me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it."

"If it was a light answer," returned Darnay, "I beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important to
remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?"

"As to the great service," said Carton, "I am bound to avow to you, when
you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap, I
don't know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.--Mind! I
say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past."

"You make light of the obligation," returned Darnay, "but I will not
quarrel with _your_ light answer."

"Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my purpose;
I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me; you know I am
incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If you doubt it,
ask Stryver, and he'll tell you so."

"I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his."

"Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never done
any good, and never will."

"I don't know that you 'never will.'"

"But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could endure
to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might be
permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the
resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I
doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I
should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I
dare say, to know that I had it."

"Will you try?"

"That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have
indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?"

"I think so, Carton, by this time."

They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself.

He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

"We are thoughtful to-night!" said Darnay, drawing his arm about her.

"Yes, dearest Charles," with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring
and attentive expression fixed upon him; "we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night."

"What is it, my Lucie?"

"Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to
ask it?"

"Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?"

What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!

"I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night."

"Indeed, my own? Why so?"

"That is what you are not to ask me. But I think--I know--he does."

"If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my Life?"

"I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding."

"It is a painful reflection to me," said Charles Darnay, quite
astounded, "that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought this
of him."

"My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things."

She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.

"And, O my dearest Love!" she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying her
head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, "remember how strong
we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!"

The supplication touched him home. "I will always remember it, dear
Heart! I will remember it as long as I live."

He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded
her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets,
could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops
of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of
that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not
have parted from his lips for the first time--

"God bless her for her sweet compassion!"




XXI. Echoing Footsteps


A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in
the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of
years.

At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife,
when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be
dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light,
afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much.
Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her:
doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided
her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of
footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would
be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her
eyes, and broke like waves.

That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then, among the
advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the sound of
her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would, the young
mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming. They came, and
the shady house was sunny with a child's laugh, and the Divine friend of
children, to whom in her trouble she had confided hers, seemed to take
her child in his arms, as He took the child of old, and made it a sacred
joy to her.

Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband's
step was strong and prosperous among them; her father's firm and equal.
Lo, Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane-tree in the garden!

Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
smile, "Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!" those were not
tears all of agony that wetted his young mother's cheek, as the spirit
departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it. Suffer them and
forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words!

Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were
mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed
murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as
the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or
dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of
the Two Cities that were blended in her life.

The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some
half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in
uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once
done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing
regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by
all true echoes for ages and ages.

No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a
blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother,
but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive
delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in
such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton
was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms,
and he kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of
him, almost at the last. "Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!"

Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great engine
forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend in
his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion's jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about them
but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.

These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the most
offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like three
sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie's husband: delicately saying "Halloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!" The polite
rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated Mr.
Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account in the
training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of the
pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts
Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to "catch" him, and on the
diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him "not
to be caught." Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the
latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed
it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an
originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried
off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way.

These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes
amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little
daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her
child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active
and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told.
Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself
with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any
waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet
in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her
more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the
many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed
to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her "What is
the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us,
as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to
have too much to do?"

But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly
in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound,
as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.

On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr.
Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and
her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were
all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the
lightning from the same place.

"I began to think," said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, "that
I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of
business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way
to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a
run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able
to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania
among some of them for sending it to England."

"That has a bad look," said Darnay--

"A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason
there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are
getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course
without due occasion."

"Still," said Darnay, "you know how gloomy and threatening the sky is."

"I know that, to be sure," assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, "but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration. Where is
Manette?"

"Here he is," said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.

"I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings by
which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous without
reason. You are not going out, I hope?"

"No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like," said the
Doctor.

"I don't think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can't
see."

"Of course, it has been kept for you."

"Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?"

"And sleeping soundly."

"That's right; all safe and well! I don't know why anything should be
otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put out
all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank ye. Now,
come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and hear
the echoes about which you have your theory."

"Not a theory; it was a fancy."

"A fancy, then, my wise pet," said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand. "They
are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only hear them!"

Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into anybody's
life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red, the
footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window.

Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows
heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy
heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous
roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked arms
struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter wind:
all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a
weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no matter how far off.

Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began, through what
agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a time, over the
heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the throng could
have told; but, muskets were being distributed--so were cartridges,
powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes, every
weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People who
could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands to
force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.

As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge's wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.

"Keep near to me, Jacques Three," cried Defarge; "and do you, Jacques
One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these
patriots as you can. Where is my wife?"

"Eh, well! Here you see me!" said madame, composed as ever, but not
knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe,
in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol
and a cruel knife.

"Where do you go, my wife?"

"I go," said madame, "with you at present. You shall see me at the head
of women, by-and-bye."

"Come, then!" cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. "Patriots and
friends, we are ready! The Bastille!"

With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped
into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on
depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums
beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack
began.

Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.

Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers,
cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! "Work, comrades
all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques
Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all
the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!" Thus Defarge of the
wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot.

"To me, women!" cried madame his wife. "What! We can kill as well as
the men when the place is taken!" And to her, with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.

Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing
weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work
at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys,
execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the
furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the
single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great
towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot
by the service of Four fierce hours.

A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly
perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly
the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the
wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer
walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!

So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even to
draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had been
struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his side;
Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible in the
inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was tumult,
exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding noise, yet
furious dumb-show.

"The Prisoners!"

"The Records!"

"The secret cells!"

"The instruments of torture!"

"The Prisoners!"

Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, "The Prisoners!" was
the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were an
eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and
threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained
undisclosed, Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of
these men--a man with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his
hand--separated him from the rest, and got him between himself and the
wall.

"Show me the North Tower!" said Defarge. "Quick!"

"I will faithfully," replied the man, "if you will come with me. But
there is no one there."

"What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?" asked
Defarge. "Quick!"

"The meaning, monsieur?"

"Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean that I
shall strike you dead?"

"Kill him!" croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.

"Monsieur, it is a cell."

"Show it me!"

"Pass this way, then."

Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed
by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise bloodshed,
held by Defarge's arm as he held by the turnkey's. Their three heads had
been close together during this brief discourse, and it had been as much
as they could do to hear one another, even then: so tremendous was the
noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the Fortress, and
its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases. All around
outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from which,
occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped into the
air like spray.

Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry
waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three,
linked hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and
there, especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by;
but when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of walls
and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only audible
to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they had
come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.

The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock, swung
the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and passed
in:

"One hundred and five, North Tower!"

There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by
stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There were
the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.

"Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them," said
Defarge to the turnkey.

The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes.

"Stop!--Look here, Jacques!"

"A. M.!" croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.

"Alexandre Manette," said Defarge in his ear, following the letters
with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. "And here he
wrote 'a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched
a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it
me!"

He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden
exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and
table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.

"Hold the light higher!" he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. "Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,"
throwing it to him; "rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
light higher, you!"

With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth, and,
peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the crowbar,
and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes, some mortar
and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face to avoid; and
in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the chimney
into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped with a
cautious touch.

"Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?"

"Nothing."

"Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!"

The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping
again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense
of hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more.

They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the guard
upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the people.
Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de Ville for
judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people's
blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness) be
unavenged.

In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red
decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a
woman's. "See, there is my husband!" she cried, pointing him out.
"See Defarge!" She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and
remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through
the streets, as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable
close to him when he was got near his destination, and began to
be struck at from behind; remained immovable close to him when the
long-gathering rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him
when he dropped dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot
upon his neck, and with her cruel knife--long ready--hewed off his head.

The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible idea
of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do. Saint
Antoine's blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the
iron hand was down--down on the steps of the Hotel de Ville where the
governor's body lay--down on the sole of the shoe of Madame Defarge
where she had trodden on the body to steady it for mutilation. "Lower
the lamp yonder!" cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new
means of death; "here is one of his soldiers to be left on guard!" The
swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed on.

The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving
of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces
were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes,
voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces of suffering
until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.

But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was
in vivid life, there were two groups of faces--each seven in number--so
fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll which bore
more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners, suddenly
released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried high
overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the Last
Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost spirits.
Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces, whose
drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive
faces, yet with a suspended--not an abolished--expression on them;
faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, "THOU DIDST
IT!"

Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters
and other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken
hearts,--such, and such--like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint
Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven
hundred and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay,
and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad,
and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask
at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once
stained red.




XXII. The Sea Still Rises


Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften
his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with
the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame
Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers.
Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of
Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting
themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a
portentously elastic swing with them.

Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat,
contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several
knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense
of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on
the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: "I know how
hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself;
but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
destroy life in you?" Every lean bare arm, that had been without work
before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike.
The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the experience that
they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of Saint Antoine;
the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of years, and the
last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.

Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as was
to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of her
sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a starved
grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant had
already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.

"Hark!" said The Vengeance. "Listen, then! Who comes?"

As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine
Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fast-spreading
murmur came rushing along.

"It is Defarge," said madame. "Silence, patriots!"

Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him! "Listen, everywhere!" said madame again. "Listen to him!"
Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and open
mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop had
sprung to their feet.

"Say then, my husband. What is it?"

"News from the other world!"

"How, then?" cried madame, contemptuously. "The other world?"

"Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people
that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?"

"Everybody!" from all throats.

"The news is of him. He is among us!"

"Among us!" from the universal throat again. "And dead?"

"Not dead! He feared us so much--and with reason--that he caused himself
to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But they have
found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him in. I have
seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner. I have
said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! _Had_ he reason?"

Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry.

A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife looked
steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar of a drum
was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.

"Patriots!" said Defarge, in a determined voice, "are we ready?"

Instantly Madame Defarge's knife was in her girdle; the drum was beating
in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by magic; and
The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her arms about
her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from house to
house, rousing the women.

The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked
from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into
the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From
such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their
children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground
famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one
another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions.
Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant
Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of
these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon
alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon
who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread
to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these
breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our
suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my
knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers,
and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon,
Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend
Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from
him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy,
whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they
dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men
belonging to them from being trampled under foot.

Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at
the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew
his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out
of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with
such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not
a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the
wailing children.

No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination where
this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the adjacent
open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The Vengeance,
and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great distance
from him in the Hall.

"See!" cried madame, pointing with her knife. "See the old villain bound
with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his back.
Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!" Madame put her knife
under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.

The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the cause of
her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to
others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded with the
clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of drawl,
and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge's frequent
expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at
a distance: the more readily, because certain men who had by some
wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture
to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and acted as a
telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.

At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope or
protection, directly down upon the old prisoner's head. The favour was
too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that had
stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had got
him!

It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge
had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable
wretch in a deadly embrace--Madame Defarge had but followed and turned
her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied--The Vengeance and
Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men at the windows
had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey from their high
perches--when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city, "Bring him
out! Bring him to the lamp!"

Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now, on
his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck at,
and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his
face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always
entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony of
action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one
another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go--as a cat
might have done to a mouse--and silently and composedly looked at him
while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women passionately
screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling out to have
him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft, and the rope
broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was merciful, and
held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass enough in the
mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.

Nor was this the end of the day's bad work, for Saint Antoine so shouted
and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing when
the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of the
people's enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him--would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company--set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession
through the streets.

Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children,
wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers' shops were beset by
long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.

Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.

It was almost morning, when Defarge's wine-shop parted with its last
knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife, in
husky tones, while fastening the door:

"At last it is come, my dear!"

"Eh well!" returned madame. "Almost."

Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept with
her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum's was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and had
the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine's bosom.




XXIII. Fire Rises


There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where
the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on the
crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do--beyond this: that it would probably not
be what he was ordered.

Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as
shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated
animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn
out.

Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national
blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining life, and a great deal more to equal purpose;
nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought
things to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for
Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must
be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it
was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing
to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.

But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like
it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung
it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures
of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting
the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces
of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted in
the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the
disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.

For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and
to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in
thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if
he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour,
and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now
a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many
highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled
with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods.

Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail.

The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill,
and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects
in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:

"How goes it, Jacques?"

"All well, Jacques."

"Touch then!"

They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.

"No dinner?"

"Nothing but supper now," said the mender of roads, with a hungry face.

"It is the fashion," growled the man. "I meet no dinner anywhere."

He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and
steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held
it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and
thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.

"Touch then." It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.

"To-night?" said the mender of roads.

"To-night," said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.

"Where?"

"Here."

He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at
one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge
of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.

"Show me!" said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.

"See!" returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. "You go down
here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--"

"To the Devil with all that!" interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over the landscape. "_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?"

"Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village."

"Good. When do you cease to work?"

"At sunset."

"Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without
resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child. Will you
wake me?"

"Surely."

The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his
great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He
was fast asleep directly.

As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling
away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to
by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap
now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the
heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used
his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account.
The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen
red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of
beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen
and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender
of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were
footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed
with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long
leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into
sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at
secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept
with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips.
Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches, and
drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as against
this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and
looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped by no
obstacle, tending to centres all over France.

The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him.

"Good!" said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. "Two leagues beyond the
summit of the hill?"

"About."

"About. Good!"

The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain,
squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and
appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village.
When the village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed,
as it usually did, but came out of doors again, and remained there. A
curious contagion of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered
together at the fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of
looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle,
chief functionary of the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top
alone, and looked in that direction too; glanced down from behind his
chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to
the sacristan who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need
to ring the tocsin by-and-bye.

The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping its
solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened
the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two terrace
flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door, like a
swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went through
the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the
stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis
had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.

But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself strangely
visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous.
Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front,
picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades, arches,
and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter.
Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the
stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.

A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left
there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was
spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the
space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur
Gabelle's door. "Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!" The tocsin rang
impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The
mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood
with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the
sky. "It must be forty feet high," said they, grimly; and never moved.

The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire;
removed from them, a group of soldiers. "Help, gentlemen--officers! The
chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid! Help, help!" The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, "It must burn."

As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and
fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of
lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in
every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on
that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to
authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with,
and that post-horses would roast.

The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and
raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the
infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising
and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in
torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the
two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke
again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake
and contending with the fire.

The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce
figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten
lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran
dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the
heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied
birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures
trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded
roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next
destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and,
abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.

Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter
days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his
house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again
withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man
of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the
parapet, and crush a man or two below.

Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door,
combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while.

Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom
the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they
had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up
in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.




XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock


In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by
the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on
the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays
of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful
tissue of the life of her home.

Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in
the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of
a people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.

Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of
his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in France, as
to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it, and
this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could
ask the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord's Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One, no
sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.

The shining Bull's Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been the
mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with--had long had the mote in it of Lucifer's pride,
Sardanapalus's luxury, and a mole's blindness--but it had dropped
out and was gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its
outermost rotten ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was
all gone together. Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and
"suspended," when the last tidings came over.

The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was
come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.

As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of
Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to
haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur
without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be.
Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most
to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent
house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen
from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming
storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made
provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there
by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer
from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as
a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that
time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this
was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in
consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news
out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran
through Temple Bar to read.

On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles
Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The
penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now
the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an
hour or so of the time of closing.

"But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived," said Charles
Darnay, rather hesitating, "I must still suggest to you--"

"I understand. That I am too old?" said Mr. Lorry.

"Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you."

"My dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, "you touch
some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe
enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard
upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth
interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a
disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our
House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of
old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all
these years, who ought to be?"

"I wish I were going myself," said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly,
and like one thinking aloud.

"Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!" exclaimed Mr.
Lorry. "You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman born? You
are a wise counsellor."

"My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that the
thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed through
my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some sympathy for
the miserable people, and having abandoned something to them," he spoke
here in his former thoughtful manner, "that one might be listened to,
and might have the power to persuade to some restraint. Only last night,
after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--"

"When you were talking to Lucie," Mr. Lorry repeated. "Yes. I wonder you
are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to
France at this time of day!"

"However, I am not going," said Charles Darnay, with a smile. "It is
more to the purpose that you say you are."

"And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles," Mr. Lorry
glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, "you can have no
conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and
of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The
Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers
of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they
might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set
afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these
with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise
getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of
precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall
I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose
bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about
the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!"

"How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry."

"Tut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles," said Mr. Lorry, glancing at
the House again, "you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an
impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought
to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to
whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine,
every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed
the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily
as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped."

"And do you really go to-night?"

"I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of
delay."

"And do you take no one with you?"

"All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing
to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master."

"I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and
youthfulness."

"I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little
commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and
live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old."

This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with
Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he
would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too
much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it
was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this
terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under
the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or
omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched
millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that
should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming,
years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such
vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was
such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard
with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between
going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his
word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out.

The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter
before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to
whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay
that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right
name. The address, turned into English, ran:

"Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of
France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England."

On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should
be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate
between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.

"No," said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; "I have referred it,
I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this
gentleman is to be found."

The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there
was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk. He
held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked at
it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.

"Nephew, I believe--but in any case degenerate successor--of the
polished Marquis who was murdered," said one. "Happy to say, I never
knew him."

"A craven who abandoned his post," said another--this Monseigneur had
been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated, in a load of
hay--"some years ago."

"Infected with the new doctrines," said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; "set himself in opposition to the last
Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to
the ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves."

"Hey?" cried the blatant Stryver. "Did he though? Is that the sort of
fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!"

Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on
the shoulder, and said:

"I know the fellow."

"Do you, by Jupiter?" said Stryver. "I am sorry for it."

"Why?"

"Why, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these
times."

"But I do ask why?"

"Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to
hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that
ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth
that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a
man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry
because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's
why."

Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and
said: "You may not understand the gentleman."

"I understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay," said Bully
Stryver, "and I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_
understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also
tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position
to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
gentlemen," said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers,
"I know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never
find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such
precious _protégés_. No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair
of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away."

With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver
shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of
his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk,
in the general departure from the Bank.

"Will you take charge of the letter?" said Mr. Lorry. "You know where to
deliver it?"

"I do."

"Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?"

"I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?"

"From here, at eight."

"I will come back, to see you off."

Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the
letter, and read it. These were its contents:


"Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.

"June 21, 1792. "MONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS.

"After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the
village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and
brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a
great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the
ground.

"The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my
life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against
the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an
emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not
against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that,
before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?

"Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he
not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your
ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!

"For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to
succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!

"From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and
nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the
assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.

"Your afflicted,

"Gabelle."


The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose
only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so
reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple
considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.

He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated
the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his
conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant to
do it, and that it had never been done.

The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being
always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded:--not without disquiet, but still
without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched
the times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled
until the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from
France by every highway and byway, and their property was in course of
confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out,
was as well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in
France that might impeach him for it.

But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so
far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own
bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to Paris.

Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him
to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle's
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.

His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.

Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he
struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention
with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left
it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert
it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the
sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even
saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging
Revolution that was running so fearfully wild.

As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone.
Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always
reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old,
should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in
the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his
situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety
to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not
discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his course.

He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.

A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was
booted and equipped.

"I have delivered that letter," said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. "I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?"

"That I will, and readily," said Mr. Lorry, "if it is not dangerous."

"Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye."

"What is his name?" said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
hand.

"Gabelle."

"Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?"

"Simply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.'"

"Any time mentioned?"

"He will start upon his journey to-morrow night."

"Any person mentioned?"

"No."

He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the
misty air of Fleet-street. "My love to Lucie, and to little Lucie," said
Mr. Lorry at parting, "and take precious care of them till I come back."
Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
rolled away.

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.

It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first
reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to
preserve the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious.
But, an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him
resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-and-bye
(an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a valise
of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the heavy
streets, with a heavier heart.

The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the tides
and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left his
two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
"For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name!" was the poor prisoner's cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.


The end of the second book.





Book the Third--the Track of a Storm




I. In Secret


The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than
these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of
citizen-patriots, with their national muskets in a most explosive state
of readiness, who stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them,
inspected their papers, looked for their names in lists of their own,
turned them back, or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in
hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning
Republic One and Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or
Death.

A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when Charles
Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country roads there
was no hope of return until he should have been declared a good citizen
at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his journey's end.
Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across
the road behind him, but he knew it to be another iron door in
the series that was barred between him and England. The universal
watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken in a net,
or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could not have
felt his freedom more completely gone.

This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway twenty
times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day, by
riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping him
by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had been
days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired out, in
a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.

Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle's letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.

Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in rough
red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the bed.

"Emigrant," said the functionary, "I am going to send you on to Paris,
under an escort."

"Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort."

"Silence!" growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
of his musket. "Peace, aristocrat!"

"It is as the good patriot says," observed the timid functionary. "You
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it."

"I have no choice," said Charles Darnay.

"Choice! Listen to him!" cried the same scowling red-cap. "As if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!"

"It is always as the good patriot says," observed the functionary. "Rise
and dress yourself, emigrant."

Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o'clock in the morning.

The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on either
side of him.

The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached to
his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round his
wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital.

They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.

But when they came to the town of Beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous crowd
gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many voices called
out loudly, "Down with the emigrant!"

He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:

"Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my own
will?"

"You are a cursed emigrant," cried a farrier, making at him in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; "and you are a cursed
aristocrat!"

The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider's
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, "Let him
be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris."

"Judged!" repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. "Ay! and condemned
as a traitor." At this the crowd roared approval.

Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse's head to the
yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on, with
the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make his
voice heard:

"Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor."

"He lies!" cried the smith. "He is a traitor since the decree. His life
is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!"

At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd, which
another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his
horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his horse's flanks,
and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double gates. The farrier
struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the crowd groaned; but, no
more was done.

"What is this decree that the smith spoke of?" Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the yard.

"Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants."

"When passed?"

"On the fourteenth."

"The day I left England!"

"Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others--if there are not already--banishing all emigrants, and
condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said
your life was not your own."

"But there are no such decrees yet?"

"What do I know!" said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders; "there
may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you have?"

They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night, and
then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the many
wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild ride
unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long and
lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster of poor
cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights, and
would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn
up together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and
wet, among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth
that year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by
the sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.

Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

"Where are the papers of this prisoner?" demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.

Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.

"Where," repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, "are the papers of this prisoner?"

The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. Casting his
eyes over Gabelle's letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close attention.

He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and went
into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the
gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants' carts bringing in supplies, and for similar
traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest
people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not
to mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue
forth; but, the previous identification was so strict, that they
filtered through the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew
their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the
ground to sleep or smoke, while others talked together, or loitered
about. The red cap and tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men
and women.

When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.

He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine
and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and awake,
drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping and
waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about. The
light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps of
the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.

"Citizen Defarge," said he to Darnay's conductor, as he took a slip of
paper to write on. "Is this the emigrant Evremonde?"

"This is the man."

"Your age, Evremonde?"

"Thirty-seven."

"Married, Evremonde?"

"Yes."

"Where married?"

"In England."

"Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?"

"In England."

"Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of La
Force."

"Just Heaven!" exclaimed Darnay. "Under what law, and for what offence?"

The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.

"We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were here." He
said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.

"I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response
to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before you. I
demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is not that
my right?"

"Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde," was the stolid reply. The officer
wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had written,
sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words "In secret."

Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany
him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots attended
them.

"Is it you," said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, "who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?"

"Yes," replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.

"My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me."

"My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!"

The word "wife" seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge, to say
with sudden impatience, "In the name of that sharp female newly-born,
and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?"

"You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
truth?"

"A bad truth for you," said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and
looking straight before him.

"Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a
little help?"

"None." Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.

"Will you answer me a single question?"

"Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is."

"In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?"

"You will see."

"I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?"

"You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried
in worse prisons, before now."

"But never by me, Citizen Defarge."

Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree.
He, therefore, made haste to say:

"It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to
Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the
prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?"

"I will do," Defarge doggedly rejoined, "nothing for you. My duty is to
my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against you.
I will do nothing for you."

Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family. The few words that he caught from this man's lips, first made
it known to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at
Beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him.

That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now. That
perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself that he
might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen the events
of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as, imagined by
the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled as the future
was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there was ignorant
hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which, within a few
rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon the blessed
garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge as if it had
been a hundred thousand years away. The "sharp female newly-born, and
called La Guillotine," was hardly known to him, or to the generality
of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be soon done, were
probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the doers. How could
they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a gentle mind?

Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation
from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at the prison of La Force.

A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge
presented "The Emigrant Evremonde."

"What the Devil! How many more of them!" exclaimed the man with the
bloated face.

Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew,
with his two fellow-patriots.

"What the Devil, I say again!" exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife.
"How many more!"

The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely
replied, "One must have patience, my dear!" Three turnkeys who entered
responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, "For
the love of Liberty;" which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion.

The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for!

"In secret, too," grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. "As
if I was not already full to bursting!"

He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates.

"Come!" said the chief, at length taking up his keys, "come with me,
emigrant."

Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,
until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room.

In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.

So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the ghost
of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.

It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to appearance
in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly
coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were
there--with the apparitions of the coquette, the young beauty, and the
mature woman delicately bred--that the inversion of all experience and
likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was heightened to its
utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride some progress
of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!

"In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune," said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, "I have the
honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate
happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?"

Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
words as suitable as he could find.

"But I hope," said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, "that you are not in secret?"

"I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them say
so."

"Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but a short time." Then he added, raising his voice, "I grieve to inform
the society--in secret."

There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him good wishes and encouragement. He turned at the grated door, to
render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaoler's hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.

The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they had
ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a
solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.

"Yours," said the gaoler.

"Why am I confined alone?"

"How do I know!"

"I can buy pen, ink, and paper?"

"Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more."

There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind of
the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler was
gone, he thought in the same wandering way, "Now am I left, as if I were
dead." Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned from it
with a sick feeling, and thought, "And here in these crawling creatures
is the first condition of the body after death."

"Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half." The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. "He made shoes, he made
shoes, he made shoes." The prisoner counted the measurement again, and
paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition.
"The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was one among
them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was leaning in the
embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon her golden
hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for God's sake,
through the illuminated villages with the people all awake! * * * * He
made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five paces by four and
a half." With such scraps tossing and rolling upward from the depths of
his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting
and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this extent--that it
still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of voices that he
knew, in the swell that rose above them.




II. The Grindstone


Tellson's Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was
in a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to
a great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the
troubles, in his own cook's dress, and got across the borders. A
mere beast of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his
metempsychosis no other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation
of whose chocolate for whose lips had once occupied three strong men
besides the cook in question.

Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves from the
sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready and
willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one and
indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur's
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all
things moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce
precipitation, that now upon the third night of the autumn month
of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of
Monseigneur's house, and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were
drinking brandy in its state apartments.

A place of business in London like Tellson's place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have
said to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid
over the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson's had whitewashed the
Cupid, but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest
linen, aiming (as he very often does) at money from morning to
night. Bankruptcy must inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in
Lombard-street, London, and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of
the immortal boy, and also of a looking-glass let into the wall, and
also of clerks not at all old, who danced in public on the slightest
provocation. Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things
exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had
taken fright at them, and drawn out his money.

What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would
lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in
Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons,
and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was
prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a
deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the
room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror.

He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about
that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did
his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade,
was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages
of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two
great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the
open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared
to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy,
or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless
objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had
opened, not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and
he had closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.

From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there came
the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring
in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a terrible
nature were going up to Heaven.

"Thank God," said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, "that no one near and
dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy on all
who are in danger!"

Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
"They have come back!" and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.

The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up to
go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly
opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in
amazement.

Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with
that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life.

"What is this?" cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. "What is the
matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here?
What is it?"

With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted
out in his arms, imploringly, "O my dear friend! My husband!"

"Your husband, Lucie?"

"Charles."

"What of Charles?"

"Here.

"Here, in Paris?"

"Has been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't
collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to
us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison."

The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the
beg of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices
came pouring into the courtyard.

"What is that noise?" said the Doctor, turning towards the window.

"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry. "Don't look out! Manette, for your life,
don't touch the blind!"

The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and
said, with a cool, bold smile:

"My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been
a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris? In
France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would
touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I
told Lucie so.--What is that noise?" His hand was again upon the window.

"Don't look!" cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. "No, Lucie, my
dear, nor you!" He got his arm round her, and held her. "Don't be so
terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in
this fatal place. What prison is he in?"

"La Force!"

"La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in
your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to
do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or
I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night;
you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you
to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must
instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a
room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay."

"I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can do
nothing else than this. I know you are true."

The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned the
key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and
partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor's arm, and
looked out with him into the courtyard.

Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near
enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty in all. The
people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate, and they
had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been set up
there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.

But, such awful workers, and such awful work!

The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly were two
men, whose faces, as their long hair flapped back when the whirlings of
the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible and cruel than
the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous disguise.
False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them, and their
hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all awry with
howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement and want of
sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted locks now flung
forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their necks, some women
held wine to their mouths that they might drink; and what with dropping
blood, and what with dropping wine, and what with the stream of sparks
struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and
fire. The eye could not detect one creature in the group free from
the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to get next at the
sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with the stain all
over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with the stain
upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women's lace
and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through
and through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be
sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to
the wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments
of dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And
as the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream
of sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in
their frenzied eyes;--eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have
given twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.

All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or of
any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked for
explanation in his friend's ashy face.

"They are," Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully round at
the locked room, "murdering the prisoners. If you are sure of what you
say; if you really have the power you think you have--as I believe you
have--make yourself known to these devils, and get taken to La Force. It
may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!"

Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room,
and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.

His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water,
carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone.
For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him,
surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all
linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with
cries of--"Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's
kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save
the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!" and a thousand answering shouts.

He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.

Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And O
the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!

Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and the
irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
"What is it?" cried Lucie, affrighted. "Hush! The soldiers' swords are
sharpened there," said Mr. Lorry. "The place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love."

Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping back
to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement by
the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its
dainty cushions.

The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out again,
and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone stood
alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the sun had
never given, and would never take away.




III. The Shadow


One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:--that he had no right to
imperil Tellson's by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof. His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment's demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business.

At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding out
the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference to
the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.

Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute's delay
tending to compromise Tellson's, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She said
that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in that
Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to
this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles, and
he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.

To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss Pross:
giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own occupations.
A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him.

It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed. He
was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.

"Your servant," said Mr. Lorry. "Do you know me?"

He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:

"Do you know me?"

"I have seen you somewhere."

"Perhaps at my wine-shop?"

Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: "You come from Doctor
Manette?"

"Yes. I come from Doctor Manette."

"And what says he? What does he send me?"

Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the
words in the Doctor's writing:

    "Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet.
     I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
     from Charles to his wife.  Let the bearer see his wife."

It was dated from La Force, within an hour.

"Will you accompany me," said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading
this note aloud, "to where his wife resides?"

"Yes," returned Defarge.

Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the
courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.

"Madame Defarge, surely!" said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly
the same attitude some seventeen years ago.

"It is she," observed her husband.

"Does Madame go with us?" inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as
they moved.

"Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the persons.
It is for their safety."

Beginning to be struck by Defarge's manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously
at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second woman being
The Vengeance.

They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry,
and found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his note--little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.

     "DEAREST,--Take courage.  I am well, and your father has
      influence around me.  You cannot answer this.
      Kiss our child for me."

That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who received
it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of the
hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took
to its knitting again.

There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in
the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her
neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted
eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.

"My dear," said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; "there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever
trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power
to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she
may identify them. I believe," said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his
reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more, "I state the case, Citizen Defarge?"

Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence.

"You had better, Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, "have the dear child here, and our
good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no
French."

The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, "Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope
_you_ are pretty well!" She also bestowed a British cough on Madame
Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.

"Is that his child?" said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the
first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it
were the finger of Fate.

"Yes, madame," answered Mr. Lorry; "this is our poor prisoner's darling
daughter, and only child."

The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so
threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively
kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall,
threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.

"It is enough, my husband," said Madame Defarge. "I have seen them. We
may go."

But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and
presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as
she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress:

"You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will
help me to see him if you can?"

"Your husband is not my business here," returned Madame Defarge, looking
down at her with perfect composure. "It is the daughter of your father
who is my business here."

"For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She
will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more
afraid of you than of these others."

Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.
Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her,
collected his face into a sterner expression.

"What is it that your husband says in that little letter?" asked Madame
Defarge, with a lowering smile. "Influence; he says something touching
influence?"

"That my father," said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, "has
much influence around him."

"Surely it will release him!" said Madame Defarge. "Let it do so."

"As a wife and mother," cried Lucie, most earnestly, "I implore you to
have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against
my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think
of me. As a wife and mother!"

Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:

"The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little
as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have
known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them,
often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in
themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?"

"We have seen nothing else," returned The Vengeance.

"We have borne this a long time," said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes
again upon Lucie. "Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife
and mother would be much to us now?"

She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed. Defarge
went last, and closed the door.

"Courage, my dear Lucie," said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her. "Courage,
courage! So far all goes well with us--much, much better than it has of
late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a thankful heart."

"I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw a
shadow on me and on all my hopes."

"Tut, tut!" said Mr. Lorry; "what is this despondency in the brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie."

But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon himself,
for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.




IV. Calm in Storm


Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of his
absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as could be
kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from her, that
not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart, did she
know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes and all
ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights had been
darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her had been
tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an attack upon
the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger, and that
some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.

To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on
which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him through a
scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison he had
found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prisoners were
brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be put forth
to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent back
to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal, he
had announced himself by name and profession as having been for eighteen
years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one of the
body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that this
man was Defarge.

That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to the Tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and
examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That,
the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the
Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and
assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance,
delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had
often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and
had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over.

The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had
been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had
thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress
the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him
in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies
of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this
awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man
with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him
carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged
anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes
with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it.

As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face of
his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him that
such dread experiences would revive the old danger.

But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which
could break the prison door of his daughter's husband, and deliver him.
"It all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin.
As my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be
helpful now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid
of Heaven I will do it!" Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw
the kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing
of the man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a
clock, for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which
had lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.

Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would
have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself
in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees
of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his
personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician
of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the
general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet
messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself
sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was
not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of
plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.

This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the
sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that
time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter
and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness.
Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through
that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's
ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change,
that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to
trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself
and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. "All
curious to see," thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, "but all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldn't be in better hands."

But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new
era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and
had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and
alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of
the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds
and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the
fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore.
What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year
One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above,
and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened!

There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no
measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when
time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other
count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever
of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.

And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in
all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A
revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand
revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected,
which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over
any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged
with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing;
these things became the established order and nature of appointed
things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old.
Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before
the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the
sharp female called La Guillotine.

It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a
peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which
shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window
and sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the
human race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts
from which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and
believed in where the Cross was denied.

It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted,
were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a young
Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It hushed
the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful and
good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living and one
dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many minutes.
The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended to the chief
functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger than his
namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God's own Temple every
day.

Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor walked
with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent in his
end, never doubting that he would save Lucie's husband at last. Yet the
current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried the time
away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and three
months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much more
wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December month,
that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of the
violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and squares
under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among the
terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and
victims, he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the
appearance and the story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all
other men. He was not suspected or brought in question, any more than if
he had indeed been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were
a Spirit moving among mortals.




V. The Wood-Sawyer


One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never
sure, from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her
husband's head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the
tumbrils now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright
women, brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and
old; gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all
daily brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons,
and carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst.
Liberty, equality, fraternity, or death;--the last, much the easiest to
bestow, O Guillotine!

If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the time,
had stunned the Doctor's daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom in
the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be.

As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father
had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught,
as regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The
slight devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief
that they would soon be reunited--the little preparations for his speedy
return, the setting aside of his chair and his books--these, and the
solemn prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many
unhappy souls in prison and the shadow of death--were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.

She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin to
mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and as well
attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her colour,
and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional,
thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at
night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief she had
repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under Heaven,
was on him. He always resolutely answered: "Nothing can happen to him
without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie."

They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her
father said to her, on coming home one evening:

"My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can
sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you
in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition."

"O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day."

From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day.

It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her.

"Good day, citizeness."

"Good day, citizen."

This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been
established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.

"Walking here again, citizeness?"

"You see me, citizen!"

The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he
had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison, pointed
at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent
bars, peeped through them jocosely.

"But it's not my business," said he. And went on sawing his wood.

Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment she
appeared.

"What? Walking here again, citizeness?"

"Yes, citizen."

"Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?"

"Do I say yes, mamma?" whispered little Lucie, drawing close to her.

"Yes, dearest."

"Yes, citizen."

"Ah! But it's not my business. My work is my business. See my saw! I
call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
comes!"

The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.

"I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the
family!"

Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was
impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in
his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him
first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.

He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten
him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart
up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her,
with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. "But it's
not my business!" he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again.

In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of
spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again
in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at
this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in
five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.

These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her
father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing
afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild
rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along,
decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them;
also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription
(tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible.
Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!

The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in
with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike
and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his
saw inscribed as his "Little Sainte Guillotine"--for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.

But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment
afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with
The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and
they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music
than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song,
keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison.
Men and women danced together, women danced together, men danced
together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they were a
mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as they
filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another's hands, clutched at one
another's heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then
reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport--a something, once
innocent, delivered over to all devilry--a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly
bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child's head thus distracted, the
delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.

This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer's house, the feathery snow
fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.

"O my father!" for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes she
had momentarily darkened with her hand; "such a cruel, bad sight."

"I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don't be
frightened! Not one of them would harm you."

"I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people--"

"We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing to
the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You may
kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof."

"I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!"

"You cannot see him, my poor dear?"

"No, father," said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her hand,
"no."

A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. "I salute you, citizeness,"
from the Doctor. "I salute you, citizen." This in passing. Nothing more.
Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.

"Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness
and courage, for his sake. That was well done;" they had left the spot;
"it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow."

"For to-morrow!"

"There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions
to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned
before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I know
that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed to the
Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?"

She could scarcely answer, "I trust in you."

"Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he shall
be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him with every
protection. I must see Lorry."

He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing. They
both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three tumbrils faring
away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.

"I must see Lorry," the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.

The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson's had in keeping, and to
hold his peace.

A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted
the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at the
Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted and
deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters:
National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!

Who could that be with Mr. Lorry--the owner of the riding-coat upon the
chair--who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did he come out,
agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms? To whom did
he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his voice and
turning his head towards the door of the room from which he had issued,
he said: "Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for to-morrow?"




VI. Triumph


The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were
read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The
standard gaoler-joke was, "Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you
inside there!"

"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!"

So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.

When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved
for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles
Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen
hundreds pass away so.

His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them
to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the
list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three
names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so
summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been
guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber
where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his
arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human
creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.

There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting was
soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La Force
were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and a little
concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed tears
there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to be
refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when the
common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great dogs
who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far from
insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour
or intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to
brave the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them.

The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before Charles Darnay's name was called. All the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.

"Charles Evremonde, called Darnay," was at length arraigned.

His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. Looking
at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a city, never
without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing
spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many
knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under
her arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed
in the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to
himself as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to
be waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole.

Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor
as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree
which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the
decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was
the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.

"Take off his head!" cried the audience. "An enemy to the Republic!"

The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the
prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in
England?

Undoubtedly it was.

Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?

Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.

Why not? the President desired to know.

Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful
to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left
his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present
acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in
England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.

What proof had he of this?

He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.

But he had married in England? the President reminded him.

True, but not an English woman.

A citizeness of France?

Yes. By birth.

Her name and family?

"Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who
sits there."

This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.

On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot
according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
inch of his road.

The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not
sooner?

He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England,
he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence. He had come back, to save a citizen's life, and to bear his
testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal
in the eyes of the Republic?

The populace cried enthusiastically, "No!" and the President rang his
bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry "No!"
until they left off, of their own will.

The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained
that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence
to the citizen's letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier,
but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before
the President.

The Doctor had taken care that it should be there--had assured him that
it would be there--and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced
and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so. Citizen
Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of
enemies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye--in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal's patriotic remembrance--until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury's
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was
answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde,
called Darnay.

Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he
proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his
release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in
England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in
their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat
government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as
the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these
circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the
straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the
populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur
Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself,
had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his
account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that
they were ready with their votes if the President were content to
receive them.

At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace
set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner's
favour, and the President declared him free.

Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace
sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of
these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after
his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with
the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the
streets.

His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried,
rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried
together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not
assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate
itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to
him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four
hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign
of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, "Long live the
Republic!"

The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great
crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in
Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the
concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by
turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the
shore.

They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had
taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages.
Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they
had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not
even the Doctor's entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home
on men's shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him,
and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that
he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he
was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.

In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing
him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as
they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried
him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her father
had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his
feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.

As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his
face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come
together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the
rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole.
Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the
crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river's bank,
and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.

After grasping the Doctor's hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round
his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who
lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their
rooms.

"Lucie! My own! I am safe."

"O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him."

They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was again in
his arms, he said to her:

"And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France
could have done what he has done for me."

She laid her head upon her father's breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return he
had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud of his
strength. "You must not be weak, my darling," he remonstrated; "don't
tremble so. I have saved him."




VII. A Knock at the Door


"I have saved him." It was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her.

All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately
revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on
vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be.
The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to
his real presence and trembled more.

Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking,
no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task
he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let
them all lean upon him.

Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was
the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and
partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and
citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them
occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by
Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
night.

It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher's name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette had
employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.

In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor's little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.

For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long
association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that "nonsense" (as she was
pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing
was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper without any
introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened not to be
the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing, lay hold
of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She always
made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.

"Now, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with felicity;
"if you are ready, I am."

Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross's service. He had worn
all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.

"There's all manner of things wanted," said Miss Pross, "and we shall
have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice toasts
these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it."

"It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,"
retorted Jerry, "whether they drink your health or the Old Un's."

"Who's he?" said Miss Pross.

Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning "Old
Nick's."

"Ha!" said Miss Pross, "it doesn't need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder,
and Mischief."

"Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!" cried Lucie.

"Yes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious," said Miss Pross; "but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the
streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back!
Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your
pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!
May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?"

"I think you may take that liberty," the Doctor answered, smiling.

"For gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of
that," said Miss Pross.

"Hush, dear! Again?" Lucie remonstrated.

"Well, my sweet," said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, "the
short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious
Majesty King George the Third;" Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; "and
as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish
tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!"

Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.

"I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice," said Miss Pross, approvingly.
"But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there"--it was the good creature's
way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety
with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--"is there any
prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?"

"I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet."

"Heigh-ho-hum!" said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, "then we
must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't
you move, Ladybird!"

They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in
a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.

"What is that?" she cried, all at once.

"My dear!" said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his hand
on hers, "command yourself. What a disordered state you are in! The
least thing--nothing--startles you! _You_, your father's daughter!"

"I thought, my father," said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, "that I heard strange feet upon the stairs."

"My love, the staircase is as still as Death."

As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.

"Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!"

"My child," said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, "I _have_ saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me go
to the door."

He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer rooms,
and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four rough
men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.

"The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay," said the first.

"Who seeks him?" answered Darnay.

"I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before the
Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic."

The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child clinging
to him.

"Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?"

"It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow."

Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that he
stood with the lamp in his hand, as if be woe a statue made to hold it,
moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting
the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of his red
woollen shirt, said:

"You know him, you have said. Do you know me?"

"Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor."

"We all know you, Citizen Doctor," said the other three.

He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice,
after a pause:

"Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?"

"Citizen Doctor," said the first, reluctantly, "he has been denounced to
the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen," pointing out the second who
had entered, "is from Saint Antoine."

The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:

"He is accused by Saint Antoine."

"Of what?" asked the Doctor.

"Citizen Doctor," said the first, with his former reluctance, "ask no
more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as
a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all.
The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed."

"One word," the Doctor entreated. "Will you tell me who denounced him?"

"It is against rule," answered the first; "but you can ask Him of Saint
Antoine here."

The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his
feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:

"Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by
the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other."

"What other?"

"Do _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?"

"Yes."

"Then," said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, "you will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!"




VIII. A Hand at Cards


Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. They
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. It
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye with blazing
lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the Army of the
Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ Army, or got
undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.

Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her
opinion, Miss Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity,
attended by her cavalier.

Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in the
popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that attitude,
like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
the counter, and showed what they wanted.

As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands.

In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman,
evidently English.

What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss
Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that
not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.

"What is the matter?" said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
English.

"Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!" cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again.
"After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do I find you here!"

"Don't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?" asked the
man, in a furtive, frightened way.

"Brother, brother!" cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. "Have I ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?"

"Then hold your meddlesome tongue," said Solomon, "and come out, if you
want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?"

Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, "Mr. Cruncher."

"Let him come out too," said Solomon. "Does he think me a ghost?"

Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a
word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did
so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus
of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits.

"Now," said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, "what do you
want?"

"How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!" cried Miss Pross, "to give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection."

"There. Confound it! There," said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's
lips with his own. "Now are you content?"

Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.

"If you expect me to be surprised," said her brother Solomon, "I am not
surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here. If
you really don't want to endanger my existence--which I half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. I am busy. I
am an official."

"My English brother Solomon," mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, "that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his--"

"I said so!" cried her brother, interrupting. "I knew it. You want to be
the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister. Just
as I am getting on!"

"The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!" cried Miss Pross. "Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer."

Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come of any
culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years
ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent
her money and left her!

He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging
condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative
merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case,
all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder,
hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular
question:

"I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon,
or Solomon John?"

The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
previously uttered a word.

"Come!" said Mr. Cruncher. "Speak out, you know." (Which, by the way,
was more than he could do himself.) "John Solomon, or Solomon John? She
calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know
you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that
name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name
was, over the water."

"No?"

"No. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables."

"Indeed?"

"Yes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness
at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to
yourself, was you called at that time?"

"Barsad," said another voice, striking in.

"That's the name for a thousand pound!" cried Jerry.

The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind
him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's
elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself.

"Don't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his
surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself
elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a
better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad
was not a Sheep of the Prisons."

Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy,
who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared--

"I'll tell you," said Sydney. "I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out
of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls,
an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember
faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having
a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with
the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and
sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved
conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the
nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed
to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad."

"What purpose?" the spy asked.

"It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the
street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your
company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?"

"Under a threat?"

"Oh! Did I say that?"

"Then, why should I go there?"

"Really, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't."

"Do you mean that you won't say, sir?" the spy irresolutely asked.

"You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won't."

Carton's negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his
quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it.

"Now, I told you so," said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
sister; "if any trouble comes of this, it's your doing."

"Come, come, Mr. Barsad!" exclaimed Sydney. "Don't be ungrateful.
But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up so
pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?"

"I'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you."

"I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her
own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city,
at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we
ready? Come then!"

Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up
in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced
purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only
contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was
too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved
her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to
heed what she observed.

They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr.
Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon
Pross, walked at his side.

Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the
picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked
into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years
ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger.

"Miss Pross's brother, sir," said Sydney. "Mr. Barsad."

"Barsad?" repeated the old gentleman, "Barsad? I have an association
with the name--and with the face."

"I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad," observed Carton,
coolly. "Pray sit down."

As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted,
by saying to him with a frown, "Witness at that trial." Mr. Lorry
immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised
look of abhorrence.

"Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of," said Sydney, "and has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again."

Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, "What do you
tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about
to return to him!"

"Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?"

"Just now, if at all."

"Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir," said Sydney, "and I
have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the
messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken."

Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.

"Now, I trust," said Sydney to him, "that the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he
would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--"

"Yes; I believe so."

"--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own
to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the
power to prevent this arrest."

"He may not have known of it beforehand," said Mr. Lorry.

"But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how
identified he is with his son-in-law."

"That's true," Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his
chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.

"In short," said Sydney, "this is a desperate time, when desperate games
are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I
will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one
carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the
stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend
in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr.
Barsad."

"You need have good cards, sir," said the spy.

"I'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a
brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy."

It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another
glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.

"Mr. Barsad," he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking
over a hand at cards: "Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman
is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a
Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name.
That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic
English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr.
Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the
spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom,
the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so
difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my
hand, Mr. Barsad?"

"Not to understand your play," returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.

"I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't
hurry."

He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself
into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he
poured out and drank another glassful.

"Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time."

It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards
in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable
employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing
there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for
vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in
France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen
there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He
knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint
Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police
such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment,
release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to
familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame
Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always remembered
with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he
talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved.
He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine, over and over
again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people whose lives the
guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every one employed as
he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that
he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that in spite of
his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning
terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced, and on such
grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind, he foresaw
that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many
proofs, would produce against him that fatal register, and would quash
his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are men soon
terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to justify
the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.

"You scarcely seem to like your hand," said Sydney, with the greatest
composure. "Do you play?"

"I think, sir," said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to Mr.
Lorry, "I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence, to
put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace
of which he has spoken. I admit that _I_ am a spy, and that it is
considered a discreditable station--though it must be filled by
somebody; but this gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean
himself as to make himself one?"

"I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad," said Carton, taking the answer on himself,
and looking at his watch, "without any scruple, in a very few minutes."

"I should have hoped, gentlemen both," said the spy, always striving to
hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, "that your respect for my sister--"

"I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother," said Sydney Carton.

"You think not, sir?"

"I have thoroughly made up my mind about it."

The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his
ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour,
received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,--who was a
mystery to wiser and honester men than he,--that it faltered here and
failed him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air
of contemplating cards:

"And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I
have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?"

"French. You don't know him," said the spy, quickly.

"French, eh?" repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice him
at all, though he echoed his word. "Well; he may be."

"Is, I assure you," said the spy; "though it's not important."

"Though it's not important," repeated Carton, in the same mechanical
way--"though it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know
the face."

"I think not. I am sure not. It can't be," said the spy.

"It-can't-be," muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his
glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. "Can't-be. Spoke good
French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?"

"Provincial," said the spy.

"No. Foreign!" cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a
light broke clearly on his mind. "Cly! Disguised, but the same man. We
had that man before us at the Old Bailey."

"Now, there you are hasty, sir," said Barsad, with a smile that gave his
aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; "there you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped
to lay him in his coffin."

Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable
goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it
to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.

"Let us be reasonable," said the spy, "and let us be fair. To show you
how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will
lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have
carried in my pocket-book," with a hurried hand he produced and opened
it, "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take
it in your hand; it's no forgery."

Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more
violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the
crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.

Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on
the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.

"That there Roger Cly, master," said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and
iron-bound visage. "So _you_ put him in his coffin?"

"I did."

"Who took him out of it?"

Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, "What do you mean?"

"I mean," said Mr. Cruncher, "that he warn't never in it. No! Not he!
I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it."

The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.

"I tell you," said Jerry, "that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a
take in. Me and two more knows it."

"How do you know it?"

"What's that to you? Ecod!" growled Mr. Cruncher, "it's you I have got a
old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen!
I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea."

Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.

"At another time, sir," he returned, evasively, "the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;" Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as
quite a liberal offer; "or I'll out and announce him."

"Humph! I see one thing," said Carton. "I hold another card, Mr. Barsad.
Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for
you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another
aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has
the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again!
A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong
card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?"

"No!" returned the spy. "I throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular
with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk
of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that
he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this
man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me."

"Never you trouble your head about this man," retorted the contentious
Mr. Cruncher; "you'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to
that gentleman. And look here! Once more!"--Mr. Cruncher could not
be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of his
liberality--"I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea."

The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and said,
with more decision, "It has come to a point. I go on duty soon, and
can't overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is it?
Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything in my
office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better trust my
life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In short,
I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all desperate
here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I can swear my
way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what do you want with
me?"

"Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?"

"I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,"
said the spy, firmly.

"Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at the
Conciergerie?"

"I am sometimes."

"You can be when you choose?"

"I can pass in and out when I choose."

Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he
said, rising:

"So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that
the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come
into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone."




IX. The Game Made


While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining
dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked
at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's
manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the
leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs,
and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very
questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught
his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the
hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an
infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.

"Jerry," said Mr. Lorry. "Come here."

Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance
of him.

"What have you been, besides a messenger?"

After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron,
Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, "Agicultooral
character."

"My mind misgives me much," said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger
at him, "that you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's
as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous
description. If you have, don't expect me to befriend you when you
get back to England. If you have, don't expect me to keep your secret.
Tellson's shall not be imposed upon."

"I hope, sir," pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, "that a gentleman like
yourself wot I've had the honour of odd jobbing till I'm grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so--I don't say it
is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn't, even then, be all o' one side. There'd be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don't pick up his
fardens--fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens--half fardens! no, nor
yet his quarter--a banking away like smoke at Tellson's, and a cocking
their medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going
out to their own carriages--ah! equally like smoke, if not more so.
Well, that 'ud be imposing, too, on Tellson's. For you cannot sarse the
goose and not the gander. And here's Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos
in the Old England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given,
a floppin' again the business to that degree as is ruinating--stark
ruinating! Whereas them medical doctors' wives don't flop--catch 'em at
it! Or, if they flop, their floppings goes in favour of more patients,
and how can you rightly have one without t'other? Then, wot with
undertakers, and wot with parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot
with private watchmen (all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn't get
much by it, even if it wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never
prosper with him, Mr. Lorry. He'd never have no good of it; he'd want
all along to be out of the line, if he, could see his way out, being
once in--even if it wos so."

"Ugh!" cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, "I am shocked at
the sight of you."

"Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir," pursued Mr. Cruncher,
"even if it wos so, which I don't say it is--"

"Don't prevaricate," said Mr. Lorry.

"No, I will _not_, sir," returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were
further from his thoughts or practice--"which I don't say it is--wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool, at
that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed up to
be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job you, till
your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes. If it
wos so, which I still don't say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father's place, and take care of
his mother; don't blow upon that boy's father--do not do it, sir--and
let that father go into the line of the reg'lar diggin', and make amends
for what he would have undug--if it wos so--by diggin' of 'em in with
a will, and with conwictions respectin' the futur' keepin' of 'em safe.
That, Mr. Lorry," said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his
arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his
discourse, "is wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don't
see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects
without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down
to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of
things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you
fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good
cause when I might have kep' it back."

"That at least is true," said Mr. Lorry. "Say no more now. It may be
that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action--not in words. I want no more words."

Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. "Adieu, Mr. Barsad," said the former; "our
arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me."

He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they
were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?

"Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access
to him, once."

Mr. Lorry's countenance fell.

"It is all I could do," said Carton. "To propose too much, would be
to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
weakness of the position. There is no help for it."

"But access to him," said Mr. Lorry, "if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him."

"I never said it would."

Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late,
and his tears fell.

"You are a good man and a true friend," said Carton, in an altered
voice. "Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my
father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your
sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however."

Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there
was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.

"To return to poor Darnay," said Carton. "Don't tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence."

Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to
see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
evidently understood it.

"She might think a thousand things," Carton said, "and any of them would
only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when
I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any
little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that.
You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night."

"I am going now, directly."

"I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance
on you. How does she look?"

"Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful."

"Ah!"

It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh--almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry's eyes to Carton's face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little
flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair,
all untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was
sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot.

"I forgot it," he said.

Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression.

"And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?" said Carton, turning
to him.

"Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so
unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to
have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have
my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go."

They were both silent.

"Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?" said Carton, wistfully.

"I am in my seventy-eighth year."

"You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?"

"I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I
may say that I was a man of business when a boy."

"See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss
you when you leave it empty!"

"A solitary old bachelor," answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. "There
is nobody to weep for me."

"How can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?"

"Yes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said."

"It _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?"

"Surely, surely."

"If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night,
'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or
respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no
regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!'
your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?"

"You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be."

Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:

"I should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the
days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?"

Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:

"Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and
nearer to the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and
preparings of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances
that had long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!),
and by many associations of the days when what we call the World was not
so real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me."

"I understand the feeling!" exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush. "And
you are the better for it?"

"I hope so."

Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on with
his outer coat; "But you," said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme, "you
are young."

"Yes," said Carton. "I am not old, but my young way was never the way to
age. Enough of me."

"And of me, I am sure," said Mr. Lorry. "Are you going out?"

"I'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be
uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?"

"Yes, unhappily."

"I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
place for me. Take my arm, sir."

Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A
few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him
there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
the prison every day. "She came out here," he said, looking about him,
"turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her steps."

It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force,
where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having
closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.

"Good night, citizen," said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the
man eyed him inquisitively.

"Good night, citizen."

"How goes the Republic?"

"You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount
to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being
exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!"

"Do you often go to see him--"

"Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?"

"Never."

"Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!"

As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain
how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire
to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.

"But you are not English," said the wood-sawyer, "though you wear
English dress?"

"Yes," said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.

"You speak like a Frenchman."

"I am an old student here."

"Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman."

"Good night, citizen."

"But go and see that droll dog," the little man persisted, calling after
him. "And take a pipe with you!"

Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle of
the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on a scrap
of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who remembered
the way well, several dark and dirty streets--much dirtier than usual,
for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in those times of
terror--he stopped at a chemist's shop, which the owner was closing with
his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a tortuous, up-hill
thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.

Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. "Whew!" the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. "Hi! hi! hi!"

Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:

"For you, citizen?"

"For me."

"You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?"

"Perfectly."

Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them, one by
one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for them,
and deliberately left the shop. "There is nothing more to do," said he,
glancing upward at the moon, "until to-morrow. I can't sleep."

It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these words
aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end.

Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors as a
youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave. His
mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had been
read at his father's grave, arose in his mind as he went down the dark
streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds sailing
on high above him. "I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord:
he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and
whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die."

In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow's victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow's and to-morrow's, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship's anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on.

With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors
surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers
were said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length
of self-destruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and
profligates; in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon
the gates, for Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets
along which the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and
material, that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among
the people out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn
interest in the whole life and death of the city settling down to its
short nightly pause in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for
the lighter streets.

Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the
people poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At
one of the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking
for a way across the street through the mud. He carried the child over,
and before the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.

"I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die."

Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm
and steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
heard them always.

The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to the
water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the
sky. Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died,
and for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to
Death's dominion.

But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that burden
of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright rays.
And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of light
appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it.

The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the
bank. When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little
longer, watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the
stream absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.--"Like me."

A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track
in the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors,
ended in the words, "I am the resurrection and the life."

Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise
where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing but a
little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to refresh
himself, went out to the place of trial.

The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep--whom many fell
away from in dread--pressed him into an obscure corner among the crowd.
Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there. She was there,
sitting beside her father.

When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying
tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy
blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If
there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney
Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly.

Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have
been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not
first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.

Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good
republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day
after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and
his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance
gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St.
Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.

Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye
in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one
another, before bending forward with a strained attention.

Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused and
retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected and
Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of tyrants,
one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.

To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.

The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?

"Openly, President."

"By whom?"

"Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine."

"Good."

"Therese Defarge, his wife."

"Good."

"Alexandre Manette, physician."

A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor
Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been seated.

"President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and
a fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!"

"Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority of
the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is dearer
to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic."

Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell, and
with warmth resumed.

"If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!"

Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with
his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth.

Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his
being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of
his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release,
and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him.
This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work.

"You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?"

"I believe so."

Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: "You were one of the
best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day
there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when
it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!"

It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience,
thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The
Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, "I defy that bell!"
wherein she was likewise much commended.

"Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen."

"I knew," said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
"I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He
knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower,
when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve,
when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to
the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a
stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is
that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens
of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President."

"Let it be read."

In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking
lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with
solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the
reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge
never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there
intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as
follows.




X. The Substance of the Shadow


"I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write
it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it
in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a
place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I
and my sorrows are dust.

"These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with
difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed
with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope
has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have
noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I
solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the
truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they
be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.

"One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the
twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired
part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air,
at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the
School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very
fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it
might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a
voice called to the driver to stop.

"The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the
door and alight before I came up with it.

"I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice,
and (as far as I could see) face too.

"'You are Doctor Manette?' said one.

"I am."

"'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris?'

"'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so
graciously.'

"'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being
so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were
probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of
overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?'

"The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words
were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.
They were armed. I was not.

"'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned.'

"The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor,
your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for
yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to
enter the carriage?'

"I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both
entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The
carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.

"I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that
it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took
place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make
the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my
paper in its hiding-place.

        *****

"The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by
a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had
overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.

"There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But, the
other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.

"From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and had
relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I was
conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed.

"The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly not much
past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms were bound to
her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that these bonds were
all portions of a gentleman's dress. On one of them, which was a fringed
scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial bearings of a Noble,
and the letter E.

"I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient;
for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and was
in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to relieve
her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in the
corner caught my sight.

"I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm her
and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated and
wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and then counted up to
twelve, and said, 'Hush!' For an instant, and no more, she would pause
to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and she
would repeat the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' and
would count up to twelve, and say, 'Hush!' There was no variation in the
order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular moment's
pause, in the utterance of these sounds.

"'How long,' I asked, 'has this lasted?'

"To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority. It
was the elder who replied, 'Since about this hour last night.'

"'She has a husband, a father, and a brother?'

"'A brother.'

"'I do not address her brother?'

"He answered with great contempt, 'No.'

"'She has some recent association with the number twelve?'

"The younger brother impatiently rejoined, 'With twelve o'clock?'

"'See, gentlemen,' said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast, 'how
useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was coming
to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost. There
are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.'

"The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, 'There is
a case of medicines here;' and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table.

        *****

"I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to my
lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that were
poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.

"'Do you doubt them?' asked the younger brother.

"'You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,' I replied, and said no
more.

"I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it
after a while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then
sat down by the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman
in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into
a corner. The house was damp and decayed, indifferently
furnished--evidently, recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick
old hangings had been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the
sound of the shrieks. They continued to be uttered in their regular
succession, with the cry, 'My husband, my father, and my brother!' the
counting up to twelve, and 'Hush!' The frenzy was so violent, that I had
not unfastened the bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to
them, to see that they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement
in the case, was, that my hand upon the sufferer's breast had this much
soothing influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the
figure. It had no effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more
regular.

"For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:

"'There is another patient.'

"I was startled, and asked, 'Is it a pressing case?'

"'You had better see,' he carelessly answered; and took up a light.

        *****

"The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase, which
was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered ceiling
to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof, and
there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion of
the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to
pass through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial
and unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in
this my cell in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my
captivity, as I saw them all that night.

"On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head, lay a
handsome peasant boy--a boy of not more than seventeen at the most.
He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on his
breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could see
that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.

"'I am a doctor, my poor fellow,' said I. 'Let me examine it.'

"'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.'

"It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away.
The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours
before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to
without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder
brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was
ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all
as if he were a fellow-creature.

"'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I.

"'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him,
and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.'

"There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would
have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his
vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about
the boy, or about his fate.

"The boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now
slowly moved to me.

"'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are
proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill us; but
we have a little pride left, sometimes. She--have you seen her, Doctor?'

"The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by the
distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.

"I said, 'I have seen her.'

"'She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too: a
tenant of his. We were all tenants of his--that man's who stands there.
The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.'

"It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.

"'We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we common dogs
are by those superior Beings--taxed by him without mercy, obliged to
work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his mill, obliged
to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and forbidden
for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged and
plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of meat, we
ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed, that his
people should not see it and take it from us--I say, we were so robbed,
and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it was a
dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we should
most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our miserable
race die out!'

"I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people
somewhere; but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the
dying boy.

"'Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that time,
poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and comfort
him in our cottage--our dog-hut, as that man would call it. She had not
been married many weeks, when that man's brother saw her and admired
her, and asked that man to lend her to him--for what are husbands among
us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good and virtuous, and
hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine. What did the two
then, to persuade her husband to use his influence with her, to make her
willing?'

"The boy's eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to the
looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The two
opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in this
Bastille; the gentleman's, all negligent indifference; the peasant's, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.

"'You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him and
drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in their
grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was
not persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed--if he
could find food--he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her bosom.'

"Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to
tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of death, as
he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to cover his
wound.

"'Then, with that man's permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told his
brother--and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor, if
it is now--his brother took her away--for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the
tidings home, our father's heart burst; he never spoke one of the words
that filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place
beyond the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be
_his_ vassal. Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed
in--a common dog, but sword in hand.--Where is the loft window? It was
somewhere here?'

"The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing around
him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were trampled
over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.

"'She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he was
dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then struck
at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at him as to
make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will, the sword
that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend himself--thrust
at me with all his skill for his life.'

"My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments of
a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman's. In
another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a soldier's.

"'Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?'

"'He is not here,' I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
referred to the brother.

"'He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
man who was here? Turn my face to him.'

"I did so, raising the boy's head against my knee. But, invested for the
moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely: obliging
me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.

"'Marquis,' said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide, and
his right hand raised, 'in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that
I do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for,
I summon your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them
separately. I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do
it.'

"Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the
finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him
down dead.

        *****

"When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving
in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last
for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave.

"I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order
of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve. Hush!'

"This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had
come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to
falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.

"It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to
compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being
a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had
had of her.

"'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.

"'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.'

"'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down
at her with some curiosity.

"'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and
despair.'

"He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a
chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a
subdued voice,

"'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I
recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high,
and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen,
and not spoken of.'

"I listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering.

"'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?'

"'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients
are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I
was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.

"Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.

        *****

"I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so
fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total
darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or
failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that
was ever spoken between me and those brothers.

"She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few
syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.

"I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until
then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the
woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind
the curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as
if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.

"I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother's (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
brother's eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more polite to
me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an incumbrance
in the mind of the elder, too.

"My patient died, two hours before midnight--at a time, by my watch,
answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was alone
with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one side, and
all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.

"The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.

"'At last she is dead?' said the elder, when I went in.

"'She is dead,' said I.

"'I congratulate you, my brother,' were his words as he turned round.

"He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking. He now
gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it on
the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.

"'Pray excuse me,' said I. 'Under the circumstances, no.'

"They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine to
them, and we parted without another word on either side.

        *****

"I am weary, weary, weary--worn down by misery. I cannot read what I
have written with this gaunt hand.

"Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the
circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities
of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be
heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a
profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state
in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but
I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.

"I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it.
It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just
completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.

        *****

"I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is
so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so
dreadful.

"The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long
life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately.

"My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and I
know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected, and
in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband's
share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl
was dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her,
in secret, a woman's sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.

"She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living, and
her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the hope
that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both.

        *****

"These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a warning,
yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.

"She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How
could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and his influence
was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in dread of her
husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there was a child, a
pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.

"'For his sake, Doctor,' she said, pointing to him in tears, 'I would do
all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper in his
inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent
atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him. What
I have left to call my own--it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels--I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the
compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if
the sister can be discovered.'

"She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, 'It is for thine own dear
sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?' The child answered her
bravely, 'Yes!' I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
went away caressing him. I never saw her more.

"As she had mentioned her husband's name in the faith that I knew it,
I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.

"That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in
a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed
my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant came
into the room where I sat with my wife--O my wife, beloved of my heart!
My fair young English wife!--we saw the man, who was supposed to be at
the gate, standing silent behind him.

"An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain me,
he had a coach in waiting.

"It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the
house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and
my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark
corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from
his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light
of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot.
Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living
grave.

"If it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of
my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or
dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But,
now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that
they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth."

A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A
sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.

Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured
Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their
time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been
anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register.
The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have
sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.

And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a
well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife. One
of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and
self-immolations on the people's altar. Therefore when the President
said (else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good
physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by
rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child an
orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.

"Much influence around him, has that Doctor?" murmured Madame Defarge,
smiling to The Vengeance. "Save him now, my Doctor, save him!"

At every juryman's vote, there was a roar. Another and another. Roar and
roar.

Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy
of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!




XI. Dusk


The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.

The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors,
the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court's
emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood
stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face
but love and consolation.

"If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if
you would have so much compassion for us!"

There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace
him then; it is but a moment." It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by
leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.

"Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We
shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"

They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.

"I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't suffer
for me. A parting blessing for our child."

"I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
you."

"My husband. No! A moment!" He was tearing himself apart from her.
"We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God
will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."

Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both
of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:

"No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel
to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know, now what
you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We
know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for
her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and
duty. Heaven be with you!"

Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair,
and wring them with a shriek of anguish.

"It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner. "All things have worked
together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to
discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my fatal presence
near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in
nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven
bless you!"

As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him
with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting
smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned, laid her head
lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet.

Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a
flush of pride in it.

"Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight."

He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver.

When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of
the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried her up
the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch, where
her child and Miss Pross wept over her.

"Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter, "she is
better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints."

"Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!" cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. "Now that
you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to
save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who
love her, bear to see her so?"

He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He
put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.

"Before I go," he said, and paused--"I may kiss her?"

It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face
with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to
him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a
handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life you love."

When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry
and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:

"You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least
be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to
you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"

"Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did." He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.

"Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few
and short, but try."

"I intend to try. I will not rest a moment."

"That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before
now--though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together, "such
great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse
it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not."

"I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the President
straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will
write too, and--But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and no
one will be accessible until dark."

"That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the
forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen
these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"

"Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this."

"It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
our friend or from yourself?"

"Yes."

"May you prosper!"

Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the
shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.

"I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.

"Nor have I."

"If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man's
to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court."

"And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."

Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.

"Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I encouraged
Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly
thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."

"Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are right.
But he will perish; there is no real hope."

"Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton.

And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.




XII. Darkness


Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. "At
Tellson's banking-house at nine," he said, with a musing face. "Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
Let me think it out!"

Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a
turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought
in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was
confirmed. "It is best," he said, finally resolved, "that these people
should know there is such a man as I here." And he turned his face
towards Saint Antoine.

Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in
the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city
well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained
its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined
at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the
first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he
had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry's hearth like a man who had
done with it.

It was as late as seven o'clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out
into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge's, and went in.

There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the
restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon
the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the
Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like
a regular member of the establishment.

As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.

He repeated what he had already said.

"English?" asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.

After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were
slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign
accent. "Yes, madame, yes. I am English!"

Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, "I swear to you, like Evremonde!"

Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.

"How?"

"Good evening."

"Oh! Good evening, citizen," filling his glass. "Ah! and good wine. I
drink to the Republic."

Defarge went back to the counter, and said, "Certainly, a little like."
Madame sternly retorted, "I tell you a good deal like." Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, "He is so much in your mind, see you, madame."
The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, "Yes, my faith! And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to-morrow!"

Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow
forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation.

"It is true what madame says," observed Jacques Three. "Why stop? There
is great force in that. Why stop?"

"Well, well," reasoned Defarge, "but one must stop somewhere. After all,
the question is still where?"

"At extermination," said madame.

"Magnificent!" croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.

"Extermination is good doctrine, my wife," said Defarge, rather
troubled; "in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has
suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
the paper was read."

"I have observed his face!" repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily.
"Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the
face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!"

"And you have observed, my wife," said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner,
"the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!"

"I have observed his daughter," repeated madame; "yes, I have observed
his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I
have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and
I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
finger--!" She seemed to raise it (the listener's eyes were always on
his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as
if the axe had dropped.

"The citizeness is superb!" croaked the Juryman.

"She is an Angel!" said The Vengeance, and embraced her.

"As to thee," pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, "if it
depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this
man even now."

"No!" protested Defarge. "Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I
would leave the matter there. I say, stop there."

"See you then, Jacques," said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; "and see you,
too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as
tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register,
doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so."

"It is so," assented Defarge, without being asked.

"In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot,
by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so."

"It is so," assented Defarge.

"That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is
burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between
those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is
that so."

"It is so," assented Defarge again.

"I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two
hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up
among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured
by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my
family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground
was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child
was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father,
those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things
descends to me!' Ask him, is that so."

"It is so," assented Defarge once more.

"Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop," returned madame; "but don't
tell me."

Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature
of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing
her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed
a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but
only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. "Tell
the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!"

Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer
paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as
a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge
took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road.
The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might
be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and strike under it sharp and
deep.

But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the
prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry's room again, where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the
banking-house towards four o'clock. She had some faint hopes that his
mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been
more than five hours gone: where could he be?

Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.

He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette
did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and
brought none. Where could he be?

They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some
weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on
the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was
lost.

Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that
time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at
them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.

"I cannot find it," said he, "and I must have it. Where is it?"

His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.

"Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I
can't find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must
finish those shoes."

They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.

"Come, come!" said he, in a whimpering miserable way; "let me get to
work. Give me my work."

Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.

"Don't torture a poor forlorn wretch," he implored them, with a dreadful
cry; "but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are
not done to-night?"

Lost, utterly lost!

It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,
that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and
soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should
have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the
embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret
time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into
the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.

Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle
of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:

"The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be taken
to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to
me? Don't ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and
exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one."

"I do not doubt it," answered Mr. Lorry. "Say on."

The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night.

Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton
took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. "We should look
at this!" he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and
exclaimed, "Thank _God!_"

"What is it?" asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.

"A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First," he put his hand in
his coat, and took another paper from it, "that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?"

Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.

"Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison."

"Why not?"

"I don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor
Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him
and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the
frontier! You see?"

"Yes!"

"Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil,
yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don't stay to look; put it
up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until
within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is
good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to
think, will be."

"They are not in danger?"

"They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame
Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that
woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong
colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He
confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall,
is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her"--he never mentioned Lucie's
name--"making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that
the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for
both have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horrified. You
will save them all."

"Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?"

"I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend
on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place
until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards;
more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to
mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her
father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the
inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that
strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?"

"So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for
the moment I lose sight," touching the back of the Doctor's chair, "even
of this distress."

"You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast
as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been
completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your
horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o'clock in the
afternoon."

"It shall be done!"

His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
flame, and was as quick as youth.

"You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man?
Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child
and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head
beside her husband's cheerfully." He faltered for an instant; then went
on as before. "For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her
the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell
her that it was her husband's last arrangement. Tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?"

"I am sure of it."

"I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in
the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage.
The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away."

"I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?"

"You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will
reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and
then for England!"

"Why, then," said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady
hand, "it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young
and ardent man at my side."

"By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing will
influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to one
another."

"Nothing, Carton."

"Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for
any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must
inevitably be sacrificed."

"I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully."

"And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!"

Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though he even
put the old man's hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He
helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers,
as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find
where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought
to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the
courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in
the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to
it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a
Farewell.




XIII. Fifty-two


In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were
to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants
were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday,
the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set
apart.

Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy,
whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered
in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
without distinction.

Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line
of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him nothing.

Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts
and degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and
when he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded,
this was closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts,
a turbulent and heated working of his heart, that contended against
resignation. If, for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and
child who had to live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a
selfish thing.

But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there
was no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So,
by degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his
thoughts much higher, and draw comfort down.

Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the
prison lamps should be extinguished.

He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing
of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself,
and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that
her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her,
for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had
become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled
to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on
that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had
preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that
he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no
mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had
discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He
besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console
her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think
of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly
reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and
blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their
dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her
father.

To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And
he told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any
despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might be
tending.

To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly affairs.
That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship and warm
attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His mind was so
full of the others, that he never once thought of him.

He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out. When
he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this world.

But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in the
sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened, until it
flashed upon his mind, "this is the day of my death!"

Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two heads
were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that he could
meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his waking
thoughts, which was very difficult to master.

He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be dyed
red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the first,
or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.

The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly
repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over.
He could walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for
himself and for them.

Twelve gone for ever.

He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he would
be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted heavily
and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep Two
before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.

Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a very
different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La Force,
he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour had
measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for his
recovered self-possession, he thought, "There is but another now," and
turned to walk again.

Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.

The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened, or
as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: "He has never seen
me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near. Lose
no time!"

The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before him
face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.

There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for the
first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of his own
imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the prisoner's
hand, and it was his real grasp.

"Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?" he said.

"I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now. You
are not"--the apprehension came suddenly into his mind--"a prisoner?"

"No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her--your
wife, dear Darnay."

The prisoner wrung his hand.

"I bring you a request from her."

"What is it?"

"A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember."

The prisoner turned his face partly aside.

"You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you. You must comply with it--take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine."

There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.

"Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your will to
them. Quick!"

"Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done. You
will only die with me. It is madness."

"It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I ask you
to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here. Change
that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While you do
it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your hair like
this of mine!"

With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action,
that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon him.
The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.

"Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never
can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you
not to add your death to the bitterness of mine."

"Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
steady enough to write?"

"It was when you came in."

"Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!"

Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.
Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.

"Write exactly as I speak."

"To whom do I address it?"

"To no one." Carton still had his hand in his breast.

"Do I date it?"

"No."

The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with
his hand in his breast, looked down.

"'If you remember,'" said Carton, dictating, "'the words that passed
between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.
You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them.'"

He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look
up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon
something.

"Have you written 'forget them'?" Carton asked.

"I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?"

"No; I am not armed."

"What is it in your hand?"

"You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more." He
dictated again. "'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove
them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.'" As he said these
words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer's face.

The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about
him vacantly.

"What vapour is that?" he asked.

"Vapour?"

"Something that crossed me?"

"I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen
and finish. Hurry, hurry!"

As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the
prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his
hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him.

"Hurry, hurry!"

The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.

"'If it had been otherwise;'" Carton's hand was again watchfully and
softly stealing down; "'I never should have used the longer opportunity.
If it had been otherwise;'" the hand was at the prisoner's face; "'I
should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
otherwise--'" Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs.

Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up
with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his
nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist. For a few
seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his
life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on
the ground.

Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton
dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back
his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he
softly called, "Enter there! Come in!" and the Spy presented himself.

"You see?" said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the
insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: "is your hazard very
great?"

"Mr. Carton," the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, "my
hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain."

"Don't fear me. I will be true to the death."

"You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear."

"Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the
rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
take me to the coach."

"You?" said the Spy nervously.

"Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which
you brought me in?"

"Of course."

"I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you
take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has
happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands.
Quick! Call assistance!"

"You swear not to betray me?" said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a
last moment.

"Man, man!" returned Carton, stamping his foot; "have I sworn by no
solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious
moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place
him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him
yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of
last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!"

The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.

"How, then?" said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. "So
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of
Sainte Guillotine?"

"A good patriot," said the other, "could hardly have been more afflicted
if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank."

They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.

"The time is short, Evremonde," said the Spy, in a warning voice.

"I know it well," answered Carton. "Be careful of my friend, I entreat
you, and leave me."

"Come, then, my children," said Barsad. "Lift him, and come away!"

The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote
suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed,
footsteps passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry
made, that seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he
sat down at the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.

Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and
finally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely
saying, "Follow me, Evremonde!" and he followed into a large dark room,
at a distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows
within, and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern
the others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground.

As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fifty-two
were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace him,
as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread of
discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young
woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was
no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from
the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him.

"Citizen Evremonde," she said, touching him with her cold hand. "I am a
poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force."

He murmured for answer: "True. I forget what you were accused of?"

"Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it
likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?"

The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
started from his eyes.

"I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I
am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!"

As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to, it
warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.

"I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was true?"

"It was. But, I was again taken and condemned."

"If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold your
hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give me
more courage."

As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn young
fingers, and touched his lips.

"Are you dying for him?" she whispered.

"And his wife and child. Hush! Yes."

"O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?"

"Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last."

        *****

The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.

"Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!"

The papers are handed out, and read.

"Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?"

This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old man
pointed out.

"Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?"

Greatly too much for him.

"Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is she?"

This is she.

"Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?"

It is.

"Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child. English.
This is she?"

She and no other.

"Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican;
something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton. Advocate.
English. Which is he?"

He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.

"Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?"

It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic.

"Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the
displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window.
Jarvis Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?"

"I am he. Necessarily, being the last."

It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It
is Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage it
carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer to
the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.

"Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned."

"One can depart, citizen?"

"One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!"

"I salute you, citizens.--And the first danger passed!"

These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there
is the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.

"Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go faster?"
asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.

"It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too much;
it would rouse suspicion."

"Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!"

"The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued."

Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings,
dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless
trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud is on
either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid the
stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in our
wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running--hiding--doing
anything but stopping.

Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
the posting-house.

Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands in
the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it
of ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible
existence, one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and
plaiting the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count
their money, make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results.
All the time, our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would
far outstrip the fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.

At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech with
animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on their
haunches. We are pursued?

"Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!"

"What is it?" asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.

"How many did they say?"

"I do not understand you."

"--At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?"

"Fifty-two."

"I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have it
forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!"

The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive, and
to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.

The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.




XIV. The Knitting Done


In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame
Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer,
erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the
conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who
was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited.

"But our Defarge," said Jacques Three, "is undoubtedly a good
Republican? Eh?"

"There is no better," the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, "in France."

"Peace, little Vengeance," said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with
a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, "hear me speak. My husband,
fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved
well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has
his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor."

"It is a great pity," croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head,
with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; "it is not quite like a good
citizen; it is a thing to regret."

"See you," said madame, "I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear
his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and
child must follow the husband and father."

"She has a fine head for it," croaked Jacques Three. "I have seen blue
eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held
them up." Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.

Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.

"The child also," observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment
of his words, "has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child
there. It is a pretty sight!"

"In a word," said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction,
"I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects;
but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning,
and then they might escape."

"That must never be," croaked Jacques Three; "no one must escape. We
have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day."

"In a word," Madame Defarge went on, "my husband has not my reason for
pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for
regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
therefore. Come hither, little citizen."

The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.

"Touching those signals, little citizen," said Madame Defarge, sternly,
"that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them
this very day?"

"Ay, ay, why not!" cried the sawyer. "Every day, in all weathers, from
two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes
without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes."

He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had
never seen.

"Clearly plots," said Jacques Three. "Transparently!"

"There is no doubt of the Jury?" inquired Madame Defarge, letting her
eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.

"Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my
fellow-Jurymen."

"Now, let me see," said Madame Defarge, pondering again. "Yet once more!
Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can
I spare him?"

"He would count as one head," observed Jacques Three, in a low voice.
"We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think."

"He was signalling with her when I saw her," argued Madame Defarge; "I
cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and
trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
bad witness."

The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent
protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness.

"He must take his chance," said Madame Defarge. "No, I cannot spare
him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of
to-day executed.--You?"

The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in
the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent
of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of
Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of
smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national
barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been
suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at
him out of Madame Defarge's head) of having his small individual fears
for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.

"I," said madame, "am equally engaged at the same place. After it is
over--say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section."

The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the
citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded
her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and
hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.

Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to
the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:

"She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will
be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the
justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
I will go to her."

"What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!" exclaimed Jacques
Three, rapturously. "Ah, my cherished!" cried The Vengeance; and
embraced her.

"Take you my knitting," said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
lieutenant's hands, "and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day."

"I willingly obey the orders of my Chief," said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek. "You will not be late?"

"I shall be there before the commencement."

"And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul," said
The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the
street, "before the tumbrils arrive!"

Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard, and
might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through the
mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and the
Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative
of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.

There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully
disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded
than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a
strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great
determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart
to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an
instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have
heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood
with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class,
opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without
pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of
her.

It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of
his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that
his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was
insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent her there.

Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly
worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her
dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually
walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.

Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry's
attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross
and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period.
Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.

Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.

"Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher," said Miss Pross, whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live:
"what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another
carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion."

"My opinion, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "is as you're right. Likewise
wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong."

"I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures," said
Miss Pross, wildly crying, "that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are
_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?"

"Respectin' a future spear o' life, miss," returned Mr. Cruncher, "I
hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o'
mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o'
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here
crisis?"

"Oh, for gracious sake!" cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, "record
them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man."

"First," said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage, "them poor things well out o' this, never no
more will I do it, never no more!"

"I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher," returned Miss Pross, "that you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is."

"No, miss," returned Jerry, "it shall not be named to you. Second: them
poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with
Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!"

"Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be," said Miss Pross,
striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, "I have no doubt it
is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence.--O my poor darlings!"

"I go so far as to say, miss, moreover," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--"and let my words
be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my
opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only
hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time."

"There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man," cried the distracted
Miss Pross, "and I hope she finds it answering her expectations."

"Forbid it," proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity,
additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out, "as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn't all
flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get 'em out o' this here dismal
risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-_bid_ it!" This was Mr. Cruncher's
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.

And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.

"If we ever get back to our native land," said Miss Pross, "you may rely
upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr.
Cruncher, let us think!"

Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
and nearer.

"If you were to go before," said Miss Pross, "and stop the vehicle and
horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn't
that be best?"

Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.

"Where could you wait for me?" asked Miss Pross.

Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame
Defarge was drawing very near indeed.

"By the cathedral door," said Miss Pross. "Would it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?"

"No, miss," answered Mr. Cruncher.

"Then, like the best of men," said Miss Pross, "go to the posting-house
straight, and make that change."

"I am doubtful," said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
"about leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen."

"Heaven knows we don't," returned Miss Pross, "but have no fear for me.
Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can,
and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain
of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives
that may depend on both of us!"

This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed.

The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty
minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.

Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.

The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water.

Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, "The wife of Evremonde;
where is she?"

It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were
four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.

Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful
about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different
way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch.

"You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer," said Miss
Pross, in her breathing. "Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me. I am an Englishwoman."

Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that
Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well
that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy.

"On my way yonder," said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot, "where they reserve my chair and my
knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I
wish to see her."

"I know that your intentions are evil," said Miss Pross, "and you may
depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them."

Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words meant.

"It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment," said Madame Defarge. "Good patriots will know what that means.
Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?"

"If those eyes of yours were bed-winches," returned Miss Pross, "and I
was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me. No,
you wicked foreign woman; I am your match."

Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.

"Woman imbecile and pig-like!" said Madame Defarge, frowning. "I take no
answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand
to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!"
This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.

"I little thought," said Miss Pross, "that I should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have,
except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
part of it."

Neither of them for a single moment released the other's eyes. Madame
Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross
first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.

"I am a Briton," said Miss Pross, "I am desperate. I don't care an
English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the
greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I'll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!"

Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.

But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame
Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. "Ha, ha!" she
laughed, "you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that
Doctor." Then she raised her voice and called out, "Citizen Doctor! Wife
of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool,
answer the Citizeness Defarge!"

Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.

"Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind
you! Let me look."

"Never!" said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
Madame Defarge understood the answer.

"If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back," said Madame Defarge to herself.

"As long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do," said Miss Pross to herself; "and you shall not
know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you."

"I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door," said
Madame Defarge.

"We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to
my darling," said Miss Pross.

Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

Soon, Madame Defarge's hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
waist. "It is under my arm," said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, "you
shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I hold
you till one or other of us faints or dies!"

Madame Defarge's hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke.

All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.

In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to
get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on,
out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking
away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe
and to cry, and then got up and hurried away.

By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly have
gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune, too, she
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement
like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the marks of
gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn, and her
dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and dragged a
hundred ways.

In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving
at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there,
she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains
discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and
charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the
escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.

"Is there any noise in the streets?" she asked him.

"The usual noises," Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect.

"I don't hear you," said Miss Pross. "What do you say?"

It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could
not hear him. "So I'll nod my head," thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, "at
all events she'll see that." And she did.

"Is there any noise in the streets now?" asked Miss Pross again,
presently.

Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.

"I don't hear it."

"Gone deaf in an hour?" said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
much disturbed; "wot's come to her?"

"I feel," said Miss Pross, "as if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life."

"Blest if she ain't in a queer condition!" said Mr. Cruncher, more and
more disturbed. "Wot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up?
Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?"

"I can hear," said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, "nothing. O,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts."

"If she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
journey's end," said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, "it's my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world."

And indeed she never did.




XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever


Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself,
are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in
France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf,
a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under
conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush
humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will
twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of
rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield
the same fruit according to its kind.

Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's
house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants!
No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order
of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. "If thou be changed
into this shape by the will of God," say the seers to the enchanted, in
the wise Arabian stories, "then remain so! But, if thou wear this
form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!"
Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.

As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough up
a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of faces
are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward.
So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle, that
in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation of the
hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the faces in
the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the sight;
then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of a
curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.

Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with
a lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with
drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so
heedful of their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as
they have seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes,
and think, or try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and
he a miserable creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made
drunk by horror, that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole
number appeals by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.

There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked some
question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is
always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has
no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the
girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised
against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he
shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily
touch his face, his arms being bound.

On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands
the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there.
He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, "Has he
sacrificed me?" when his face clears, as he looks into the third.

"Which is Evremonde?" says a man behind him.

"That. At the back there."

"With his hand in the girl's?"

"Yes."

The man cries, "Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
Down, Evremonde!"

"Hush, hush!" the Spy entreats him, timidly.

"And why not, citizen?"

"He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
Let him be at peace."

But the man continuing to exclaim, "Down, Evremonde!" the face of
Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the
Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.

The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the
populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and
end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and
close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following
to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of
public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On one of the
fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for her friend.

"Therese!" she cries, in her shrill tones. "Who has seen her? Therese
Defarge!"

"She never missed before," says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.

"No; nor will she miss now," cries The Vengeance, petulantly. "Therese."

"Louder," the woman recommends.

Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her!

"Bad Fortune!" cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair, "and
here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and
she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for
her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!"

As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready. Crash!--A head is held up, and the knitting-women who
scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One.

The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up. Crash!--And
the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their Work, count Two.

The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out next
after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out, but
still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to the
crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks into
his face and thanks him.

"But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been
able to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might
have hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by
Heaven."

"Or you to me," says Sydney Carton. "Keep your eyes upon me, dear child,
and mind no other object."

"I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when I let
it go, if they are rapid."

"They will be rapid. Fear not!"

The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak as
if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart to
heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her bosom.

"Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I
am very ignorant, and it troubles me--just a little."

"Tell me what it is."

"I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom I
love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
farmer's house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
nothing of my fate--for I cannot write--and if I could, how should I
tell her! It is better as it is."

"Yes, yes: better as it is."

"What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
much support, is this:--If the Republic really does good to the poor,
and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
live a long time: she may even live to be old."

"What then, my gentle sister?"

"Do you think:" the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
"that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land
where I trust both you and I will be mercifully sheltered?"

"It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble there."

"You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now? Is the
moment come?"

"Yes."

She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
him--is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.

"I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die."

The murmuring of many voices, the upturning of many faces, the pressing
on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it swells
forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.
Twenty-Three.

        *****

They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the
peacefullest man's face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked
sublime and prophetic.

One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe--a woman--had asked
at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed to
write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:

"I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the Judge,
long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of
the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall cease
out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in
their triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil
of this time and of the previous time of which this is the natural
birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

"I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful,
prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see
Her with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father,
aged and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his
healing office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their
friend, in ten years' time enriching them with all he has, and passing
tranquilly to his reward.

"I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their
course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know
that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul,
than I was in the souls of both.

"I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name, a man
winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I see him
winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by the
light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,
fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place--then fair to
look upon, with not a trace of this day's disfigurement--and I hear him
tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.

"It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a
far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

A Ghost Story of Christmas

by Charles Dickens



PREFACE

I HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,
to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my
readers out of humour with themselves, with each other,
with the season, or with me.  May it haunt their houses
pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.

Their faithful Friend and Servant,

Stave   I: Marley's Ghost
Stave  II: The First of the Three Spirits
Stave III: The Second of the Three Spirits
Stave  IV: The Last of the Spirits
Stave   V: The End of It



STAVE I:  MARLEY'S GHOST

MARLEY was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt
whatever about that. The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,
and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and
Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he
chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a
door-nail.

Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my
own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors
is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands
shall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You
will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that
Marley was as dead as a door-nail.

Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.
How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were
partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole
assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and
sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully
cut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of the funeral,
and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.

The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to
the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley
was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or
nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going
to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that
Hamlet's Father died before the play began, there
would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a
stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,
than there would be in any other middle-aged
gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy
spot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--
literally to astonish his son's weak mind.

Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.
There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse
door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as
Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the
business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
but he answered to both names. It was all the
same to him.

Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,
Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,
clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,
from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;
secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The
cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed
nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his
eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his
grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his
eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low
temperature always about with him; he iced his office in
the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.

External heat and cold had little influence on
Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather
chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,
no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no
pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't
know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and
snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage
over him in only one respect. They often "came down"
handsomely, and Scrooge never did.

Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with
gladsome looks, "My dear Scrooge, how are you?
When will you come to see me?" No beggars implored
him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him
what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all
his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of
Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to
know him; and when they saw him coming on, would
tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and
then would wag their tails as though they said, "No
eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"

But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing
he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths
of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,
was what the knowing ones call "nuts" to Scrooge.

Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year,
on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his
counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy
withal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,
go wheezing up and down, beating their hands
upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the
pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had
only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--
it had not been light all day--and candles were flaring
in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like
ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog
came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was
so dense without, that although the court was of the
narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.
To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring
everything, one might have thought that Nature
lived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.

The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open
that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a
dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying
letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's
fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept
the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the
clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted
that it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore
the clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to
warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being
a man of a strong imagination, he failed.

"A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!" cried
a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's
nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was
the first intimation he had of his approach.

"Bah!" said Scrooge, "Humbug!"

He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the
fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was
all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his
eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.

"Christmas a humbug, uncle!" said Scrooge's
nephew. "You don't mean that, I am sure?"

"I do," said Scrooge. "Merry Christmas! What
right have you to be merry? What reason have you
to be merry? You're poor enough."

"Come, then," returned the nephew gaily. "What
right have you to be dismal? What reason have you
to be morose? You're rich enough."

Scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur
of the moment, said, "Bah!" again; and followed it up
with "Humbug."

"Don't be cross, uncle!" said the nephew.

"What else can I be," returned the uncle, "when I
live in such a world of fools as this? Merry Christmas!
Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas
time to you but a time for paying bills without
money; a time for finding yourself a year older, but
not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books
and having every item in 'em through a round dozen
of months presented dead against you? If I could
work my will," said Scrooge indignantly, "every idiot
who goes about with 'Merry Christmas' on his lips,
should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried
with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!"

"Uncle!" pleaded the nephew.

"Nephew!" returned the uncle sternly, "keep Christmas
in your own way, and let me keep it in mine."

"Keep it!" repeated Scrooge's nephew. "But you
don't keep it."

"Let me leave it alone, then," said Scrooge. "Much
good may it do you! Much good it has ever done
you!"

"There are many things from which I might have
derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare
say," returned the nephew. "Christmas among the
rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas
time, when it has come round--apart from the
veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything
belonging to it can be apart from that--as a
good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant
time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar
of the year, when men and women seem by one consent
to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think
of people below them as if they really were
fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race
of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me
good, and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"

The clerk in the Tank involuntarily applauded.
Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety,
he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark
for ever.

"Let me hear another sound from you," said
Scrooge, "and you'll keep your Christmas by losing
your situation! You're quite a powerful speaker,
sir," he added, turning to his nephew. "I wonder you
don't go into Parliament."

"Don't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow."

Scrooge said that he would see him--yes, indeed he
did. He went the whole length of the expression,
and said that he would see him in that extremity first.

"But why?" cried Scrooge's nephew. "Why?"

"Why did you get married?" said Scrooge.

"Because I fell in love."

"Because you fell in love!" growled Scrooge, as if
that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous
than a merry Christmas. "Good afternoon!"

"Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before
that happened. Why give it as a reason for not
coming now?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you;
why cannot we be friends?"

"Good afternoon," said Scrooge.

"I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. We have never had any quarrel, to which I
have been a party. But I have made the trial in
homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas
humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

"And A Happy New Year!"

"Good afternoon!" said Scrooge.

His nephew left the room without an angry word,
notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to
bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who,
cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned
them cordially.

"There's another fellow," muttered Scrooge; who
overheard him: "my clerk, with fifteen shillings a
week, and a wife and family, talking about a merry
Christmas. I'll retire to Bedlam."

This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephew out, had
let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen,
pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off,
in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in
their hands, and bowed to him.

"Scrooge and Marley's, I believe," said one of the
gentlemen, referring to his list. "Have I the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"

"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,"
Scrooge replied. "He died seven years ago, this very
night."

"We have no doubt his liberality is well represented
by his surviving partner," said the gentleman, presenting
his credentials.

It certainly was; for they had been two kindred
spirits. At the ominous word "liberality," Scrooge
frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials
back.

"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,"
said the gentleman, taking up a pen, "it is more than
usually desirable that we should make some slight
provision for the Poor and destitute, who suffer
greatly at the present time. Many thousands are in
want of common necessaries; hundreds of thousands
are in want of common comforts, sir."

"Are there no prisons?" asked Scrooge.

"Plenty of prisons," said the gentleman, laying down
the pen again.

"And the Union workhouses?" demanded Scrooge.
"Are they still in operation?"

"They are. Still," returned the gentleman, "I wish
I could say they were not."

"The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour,
then?" said Scrooge.

"Both very busy, sir."

"Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first,
that something had occurred to stop them in their
useful course," said Scrooge. "I'm very glad to
hear it."

"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude,"
returned the gentleman, "a few of us are endeavouring
to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink,
and means of warmth. We choose this time, because
it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down
for?"

"Nothing!" Scrooge replied.

"You wish to be anonymous?"

"I wish to be left alone," said Scrooge. "Since you
ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer.
I don't make merry myself at Christmas and I can't
afford to make idle people merry. I help to support
the establishments I have mentioned--they cost
enough; and those who are badly off must go there."

"Many can't go there; and many would rather die."

"If they would rather die," said Scrooge, "they had
better do it, and decrease the surplus population.
Besides--excuse me--I don't know that."

"But you might know it," observed the gentleman.

"It's not my business," Scrooge returned. "It's
enough for a man to understand his own business, and
not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies
me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!"

Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue
their point, the gentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed
his labours with an improved opinion of himself,
and in a more facetious temper than was usual
with him.

Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that
people ran about with flaring links, proffering their
services to go before horses in carriages, and conduct
them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down
at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became
invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the
clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if
its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.
The cold became intense. In the main street, at the
corner of the court, some labourers were repairing
the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,
round which a party of ragged men and boys were
gathered: warming their hands and winking their
eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug
being left in solitude, its overflowings sullenly congealed,
and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness
of the shops where holly sprigs and berries
crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale
faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers'
trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant,
with which it was next to impossible to believe that
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything
to do. The Lord Mayor, in the stronghold of the
mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks
and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's
household should; and even the little tailor, whom he
had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for
being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up
to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean
wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.

Foggier yet, and colder. Piercing, searching, biting
cold. If the good Saint Dunstan had but nipped
the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather
as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then
indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The
owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled
by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,
stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with
a Christmas carol: but at the first sound of

        "God bless you, merry gentleman!
         May nothing you dismay!"

Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action,
that the singer fled in terror, leaving the keyhole to
the fog and even more congenial frost.

At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house
arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his
stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant
clerk in the Tank, who instantly snuffed his candle out,
and put on his hat.

"You'll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?" said
Scrooge.

"If quite convenient, sir."

"It's not convenient," said Scrooge, "and it's not
fair. If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd
think yourself ill-used, I'll be bound?"

The clerk smiled faintly.

"And yet," said Scrooge, "you don't think me ill-used,
when I pay a day's wages for no work."

The clerk observed that it was only once a year.

"A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every
twenty-fifth of December!" said Scrooge, buttoning
his great-coat to the chin. "But I suppose you must
have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next
morning."

The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge
walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a
twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his
white comforter dangling below his waist (for he
boasted no great-coat), went down a slide on Cornhill,
at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in
honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home
to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play
at blindman's-buff.

Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual
melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and
beguiled the rest of the evening with his
banker's-book, went home to bed. He lived in
chambers which had once belonged to his deceased
partner. They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a
lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so
little business to be, that one could scarcely help
fancying it must have run there when it was a young
house, playing at hide-and-seek with other houses,
and forgotten the way out again. It was old enough
now, and dreary enough, for nobody lived in it but
Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.
The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew
its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.
The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway
of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of
the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the
threshold.

Now, it is a fact, that there was nothing at all
particular about the knocker on the door, except that it
was very large. It is also a fact, that Scrooge had
seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence
in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what
is called fancy about him as any man in the city of
London, even including--which is a bold word--the
corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be
borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one
thought on Marley, since his last mention of his
seven years' dead partner that afternoon. And then
let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened
that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door,
saw in the knocker, without its undergoing any intermediate
process of change--not a knocker, but Marley's face.

Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow
as the other objects in the yard were, but had a
dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark
cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked
at Scrooge as Marley used to look: with ghostly
spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead. The
hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;
and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly
motionless. That, and its livid colour, made it
horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the
face and beyond its control, rather than a part of
its own expression.

As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it
was a knocker again.

To say that he was not startled, or that his blood
was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it
had been a stranger from infancy, would be untrue.
But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished,
turned it sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.

He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before
he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind
it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the
sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall.
But there was nothing on the back of the door, except
the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he
said "Pooh, pooh!" and closed it with a bang.

The sound resounded through the house like thunder.
Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's
cellars below, appeared to have a separate peal
of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to
be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and
walked across the hall, and up the stairs; slowly too:
trimming his candle as he went.

You may talk vaguely about driving a coach-and-six
up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad
young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you
might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken
it broadwise, with the splinter-bar towards the wall
and the door towards the balustrades: and done it
easy. There was plenty of width for that, and room
to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge
thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before
him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of
the street wouldn't have lighted the entry too well,
so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with
Scrooge's dip.

Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that.
Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But before
he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms
to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection
of the face to desire to do that.

Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they
should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under
the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin
ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had
a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the
bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown,
which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude
against the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard,
old shoes, two fish-baskets, washing-stand on three
legs, and a poker.

Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked
himself in; double-locked himself in, which was not his
custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off
his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and
his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take
his gruel.

It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a
bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and
brood over it, before he could extract the least
sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel.
The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch
merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint
Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.
There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters;
Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending
through the air on clouds like feather-beds, Abrahams,
Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter-boats,
hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts;
and yet that face of Marley, seven years dead, came
like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the
whole. If each smooth tile had been a blank at first,
with power to shape some picture on its surface from
the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would
have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one.

"Humbug!" said Scrooge; and walked across the
room.

After several turns, he sat down again. As he
threw his head back in the chair, his glance happened
to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the
room, and communicated for some purpose now forgotten
with a chamber in the highest story of the
building. It was with great astonishment, and with
a strange, inexplicable dread, that as he looked, he
saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in
the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it
rang out loudly, and so did every bell in the house.

This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute,
but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased as they had
begun, together. They were succeeded by a clanking
noise, deep down below; as if some person were
dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the
wine-merchant's cellar. Scrooge then remembered to have
heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as
dragging chains.

The cellar-door flew open with a booming sound,
and then he heard the noise much louder, on the floors
below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight
towards his door.

"It's humbug still!" said Scrooge. "I won't believe it."

His colour changed though, when, without a pause,
it came on through the heavy door, and passed into
the room before his eyes. Upon its coming in, the
dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, "I know
him; Marley's Ghost!" and fell again.

The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail,
usual waistcoat, tights and boots; the tassels on
the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts,
and the hair upon his head. The chain he drew was
clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound
about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge
observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks,
ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrought in steel.
His body was transparent; so that Scrooge, observing him,
and looking through his waistcoat, could see
the two buttons on his coat behind.

Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no
bowels, but he had never believed it until now.

No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he
looked the phantom through and through, and saw
it standing before him; though he felt the chilling
influence of its death-cold eyes; and marked the very
texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head
and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before;
he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.

"How now!" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.
"What do you want with me?"

"Much!"--Marley's voice, no doubt about it.

"Who are you?"

"Ask me who I was."

"Who were you then?" said Scrooge, raising his
voice. "You're particular, for a shade." He was going
to say "to a shade," but substituted this, as more
appropriate.

"In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley."

"Can you--can you sit down?" asked Scrooge, looking
doubtfully at him.

"I can."

"Do it, then."

Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know
whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in
a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event
of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity
of an embarrassing explanation. But the ghost sat
down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he
were quite used to it.

"You don't believe in me," observed the Ghost.

"I don't," said Scrooge.

"What evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of
your senses?"

"I don't know," said Scrooge.

"Why do you doubt your senses?"

"Because," said Scrooge, "a little thing affects them.
A slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats. You may
be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of
cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of
gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!"

Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking
jokes, nor did he feel, in his heart, by any means
waggish then. The truth is, that he tried to be
smart, as a means of distracting his own attention,
and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice
disturbed the very marrow in his bones.

To sit, staring at those fixed glazed eyes, in silence
for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very
deuce with him. There was something very awful,
too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal
atmosphere of its own. Scrooge could not feel it
himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the
Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts,
and tassels, were still agitated as by the hot vapour
from an oven.

"You see this toothpick?" said Scrooge, returning
quickly to the charge, for the reason just assigned;
and wishing, though it were only for a second, to
divert the vision's stony gaze from himself.

"I do," replied the Ghost.

"You are not looking at it," said Scrooge.

"But I see it," said the Ghost, "notwithstanding."

"Well!" returned Scrooge, "I have but to swallow
this, and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a
legion of goblins, all of my own creation. Humbug,
I tell you! humbug!"

At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook
its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that
Scrooge held on tight to his chair, to save himself
from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was
his horror, when the phantom taking off the bandage
round its head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors,
its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!

Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands
before his face.

"Mercy!" he said. "Dreadful apparition, why do
you trouble me?"

"Man of the worldly mind!" replied the Ghost, "do
you believe in me or not?"

"I do," said Scrooge. "I must. But why do spirits
walk the earth, and why do they come to me?"

"It is required of every man," the Ghost returned,
"that the spirit within him should walk abroad among
his fellowmen, and travel far and wide; and if that
spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned to do so
after death. It is doomed to wander through the
world--oh, woe is me!--and witness what it cannot
share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to
happiness!"

Again the spectre raised a cry, and shook its chain
and wrung its shadowy hands.

"You are fettered," said Scrooge, trembling. "Tell
me why?"

"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost.
"I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded
it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I
wore it. Is its pattern strange to you?"

Scrooge trembled more and more.

"Or would you know," pursued the Ghost, "the
weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?
It was full as heavy and as long as this, seven
Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it, since.
It is a ponderous chain!"

Scrooge glanced about him on the floor, in the
expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty
or sixty fathoms of iron cable: but he could see
nothing.

"Jacob," he said, imploringly. "Old Jacob Marley,
tell me more. Speak comfort to me, Jacob!"

"I have none to give," the Ghost replied. "It comes
from other regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed
by other ministers, to other kinds of men. Nor
can I tell you what I would. A very little more is
all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I
cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked
beyond our counting-house--mark me!--in life my
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our
money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before
me!"

It was a habit with Scrooge, whenever he became
thoughtful, to put his hands in his breeches pockets.
Pondering on what the Ghost had said, he did so now,
but without lifting up his eyes, or getting off his
knees.

"You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,"
Scrooge observed, in a business-like manner, though
with humility and deference.

"Slow!" the Ghost repeated.

"Seven years dead," mused Scrooge. "And travelling
all the time!"

"The whole time," said the Ghost. "No rest, no
peace. Incessant torture of remorse."

"You travel fast?" said Scrooge.

"On the wings of the wind," replied the Ghost.

"You might have got over a great quantity of
ground in seven years," said Scrooge.

The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and
clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of
the night, that the Ward would have been justified in
indicting it for a nuisance.

"Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed," cried the
phantom, "not to know, that ages of incessant labour
by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into
eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is
all developed. Not to know that any Christian spirit
working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may
be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast
means of usefulness. Not to know that no space of
regret can make amends for one life's opportunity
misused! Yet such was I! Oh! such was I!"

"But you were always a good man of business,
Jacob," faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this
to himself.

"Business!" cried the Ghost, wringing its hands
again. "Mankind was my business. The common
welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,
and benevolence, were, all, my business. The dealings
of my trade were but a drop of water in the
comprehensive ocean of my business!"

It held up its chain at arm's length, as if that were
the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it
heavily upon the ground again.

"At this time of the rolling year," the spectre said,
"I suffer most. Why did I walk through crowds of
fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never
raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise
Men to a poor abode! Were there no poor homes to
which its light would have conducted me!"

Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the
spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake
exceedingly.

"Hear me!" cried the Ghost. "My time is nearly
gone."

"I will," said Scrooge. "But don't be hard upon
me! Don't be flowery, Jacob! Pray!"

"How it is that I appear before you in a shape that
you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible
beside you many and many a day."

It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered,
and wiped the perspiration from his brow.

"That is no light part of my penance," pursued
the Ghost. "I am here to-night to warn you, that you
have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate. A
chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer."

"You were always a good friend to me," said
Scrooge. "Thank'ee!"

"You will be haunted," resumed the Ghost, "by
Three Spirits."

Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the
Ghost's had done.

"Is that the chance and hope you mentioned,
Jacob?" he demanded, in a faltering voice.

"It is."

"I--I think I'd rather not," said Scrooge.

"Without their visits," said the Ghost, "you cannot
hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow,
when the bell tolls One."

"Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over,
Jacob?" hinted Scrooge.

"Expect the second on the next night at the same
hour. The third upon the next night when the last
stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see
me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you
remember what has passed between us!"

When it had said these words, the spectre took its
wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head,
as before. Scrooge knew this, by the smart sound its
teeth made, when the jaws were brought together
by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again,
and found his supernatural visitor confronting him
in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and
about its arm.

The apparition walked backward from him; and at
every step it took, the window raised itself a little,
so that when the spectre reached it, it was wide open.

It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did.
When they were within two paces of each other,
Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to
come no nearer. Scrooge stopped.

Not so much in obedience, as in surprise and fear:
for on the raising of the hand, he became sensible
of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of
lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and
self-accusatory. The spectre, after listening for a moment,
joined in the mournful dirge; and floated out upon the
bleak, dark night.

Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his
curiosity. He looked out.

The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither
and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they
went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's
Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments)
were linked together; none were free. Many had
been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He
had been quite familiar with one old ghost, in a white
waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to
its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist
a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below,
upon a door-step. The misery with them all was,
clearly, that they sought to interfere, for good, in
human matters, and had lost the power for ever.

Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist
enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and
their spirit voices faded together; and the night became
as it had been when he walked home.

Scrooge closed the window, and examined the door
by which the Ghost had entered. It was double-locked,
as he had locked it with his own hands, and
the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say "Humbug!"
but stopped at the first syllable. And being,
from the emotion he had undergone, or the fatigues
of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or
the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of
the hour, much in need of repose; went straight to
bed, without undressing, and fell asleep upon the
instant.


STAVE II:  THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS

WHEN Scrooge awoke, it was so dark, that looking out of bed,
he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from
the opaque walls of his chamber. He was endeavouring to
pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a
neighbouring church struck the four quarters. So he listened
for the hour.

To his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from
six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to
twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he
went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have
got into the works. Twelve!

He touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most
preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve:
and stopped.

"Why, it isn't possible," said Scrooge, "that I can have
slept through a whole day and far into another night. It
isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and
this is twelve at noon!"

The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed,
and groped his way to the window. He was obliged to rub
the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he
could see anything; and could see very little then. All he
could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely
cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro,
and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been
if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the
world.  This was a great relief, because "three days after sight
of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his
order," and so forth, would have become a mere United States'
security if there were no days to count by.

Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought
it over and over and over, and could make nothing of it.  The more he
thought, the more perplexed he was; and the more he endeavoured
not to think, the more he thought.

Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved
within himself, after mature inquiry, that it was all a dream, his
mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first
position, and presented the same problem to be worked all through,
"Was it a dream or not?"

Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters
more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned
him of a visitation when the bell tolled one.  He resolved to lie
awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could
no more go to sleep than go to Heaven, this was perhaps the
wisest resolution in his power.

The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he
must have sunk into a doze unconsciously, and missed the clock.
At length it broke upon his listening ear.

"Ding, dong!"

"A quarter past," said Scrooge, counting.

"Ding, dong!"

"Half-past!" said Scrooge.

"Ding, dong!"

"A quarter to it," said Scrooge.

"Ding, dong!"

"The hour itself," said Scrooge, triumphantly, "and nothing else!"

He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a
deep, dull, hollow, melancholy ONE.  Light flashed up in the room
upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn.

The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a
hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his
back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains
of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a
half-recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the
unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now
to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow.

It was a strange figure--like a child: yet not so like a
child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural
medium, which gave him the appearance of having receded
from the view, and being diminished to a child's proportions.
Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was
white as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in
it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin. The arms were
very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold
were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately
formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic
of the purest white; and round its waist was bound
a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful. It held
a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular
contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed
with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was,
that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear
jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was
doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a
great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.

Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing
steadiness, was not its strangest quality. For as its belt
sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another,
and what was light one instant, at another time was dark, so
the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness: being now a
thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs,
now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a
body: of which dissolving parts, no outline would be visible
in the dense gloom wherein they melted away. And in the
very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and
clear as ever.

"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to
me?" asked Scrooge.

"I am!"

The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low, as if
instead of being so close beside him, it were at a distance.

"Who, and what are you?" Scrooge demanded.

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Past."

"Long Past?" inquired Scrooge: observant of its dwarfish
stature.

"No. Your past."

Perhaps, Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if
anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire
to see the Spirit in his cap; and begged him to be covered.

"What!" exclaimed the Ghost, "would you so soon put out,
with worldly hands, the light I give? Is it not enough
that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and
force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon
my brow!"

Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend
or any knowledge of having wilfully "bonneted" the Spirit at
any period of his life. He then made bold to inquire what
business brought him there.

"Your welfare!" said the Ghost.

Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not
help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been
more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard
him thinking, for it said immediately:

"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!"

It put out its strong hand as it spoke, and clasped him
gently by the arm.

"Rise! and walk with me!"

It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the
weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes;
that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below
freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers,
dressing-gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at
that time. The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand,
was not to be resisted. He rose: but finding that the Spirit
made towards the window, clasped his robe in supplication.

"I am a mortal," Scrooge remonstrated, "and liable to fall."

"Bear but a touch of my hand there," said the Spirit,
laying it upon his heart, "and you shall be upheld in more
than this!"

As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall,
and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either
hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it
was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished
with it, for it was a clear, cold, winter day, with snow upon
the ground.

"Good Heaven!" said Scrooge, clasping his hands together,
as he looked about him. "I was bred in this place. I was
a boy here!"

The Spirit gazed upon him mildly. Its gentle touch,
though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still
present to the old man's sense of feeling. He was conscious
of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected
with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares
long, long, forgotten!

"Your lip is trembling," said the Ghost. "And what is
that upon your cheek?"

Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catching in his voice,
that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him
where he would.

"You recollect the way?" inquired the Spirit.

"Remember it!" cried Scrooge with fervour; "I could
walk it blindfold."

"Strange to have forgotten it for so many years!" observed
the Ghost. "Let us go on."

They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every
gate, and post, and tree; until a little market-town appeared
in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river.
Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them
with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in
country gigs and carts, driven by farmers. All these boys
were in great spirits, and shouted to each other, until the
broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air
laughed to hear it!

"These are but shadows of the things that have been," said
the Ghost. "They have no consciousness of us."

The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge
knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond
all bounds to see them! Why did his cold eye glisten, and
his heart leap up as they went past! Why was he filled
with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry
Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and bye-ways, for
their several homes! What was merry Christmas to Scrooge?
Out upon merry Christmas! What good had it ever done
to him?

"The school is not quite deserted," said the Ghost. "A
solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still."

Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.

They left the high-road, by a well-remembered lane, and
soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little
weathercock-surmounted cupola, on the roof, and a bell
hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of broken
fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls
were damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their
gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables;
and the coach-houses and sheds were over-run with grass.
Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state, within; for
entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open
doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished,
cold, and vast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a
chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow
with too much getting up by candle-light, and not too
much to eat.

They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a
door at the back of the house. It opened before them, and
disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room, made barer still by
lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely
boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down
upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he
used to be.

Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle
from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the
half-thawed water-spout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among
the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar, not the idle
swinging of an empty store-house door, no, not a clicking in
the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with a softening
influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.

The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his
younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man, in
foreign garments: wonderfully real and distinct to look at:
stood outside the window, with an axe stuck in his belt, and
leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.

"Why, it's Ali Baba!" Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. "It's
dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know! One Christmas
time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone,
he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And
Valentine," said Scrooge, "and his wild brother, Orson; there
they go! And what's his name, who was put down in his
drawers, asleep, at the Gate of Damascus; don't you see him!
And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii;
there he is upon his head! Serve him right. I'm glad of it.
What business had he to be married to the Princess!"

To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature
on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between
laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited
face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in
the city, indeed.

"There's the Parrot!" cried Scrooge. "Green body and
yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the
top of his head; there he is! Poor Robin Crusoe, he called
him, when he came home again after sailing round the
island. 'Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin
Crusoe?'  The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't.
It was the Parrot, you know. There goes Friday, running
for his life to the little creek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!"

Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his
usual character, he said, in pity for his former self, "Poor
boy!" and cried again.

"I wish," Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his
pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his
cuff: "but it's too late now."

"What is the matter?" asked the Spirit.

"Nothing," said Scrooge. "Nothing. There was a boy
singing a Christmas Carol at my door last night. I should
like to have given him something: that's all."

The Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand:
saying as it did so, "Let us see another Christmas!"

Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the
room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk,
the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the
ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how
all this was brought about, Scrooge knew no more than you
do. He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything
had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all
the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays.

He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly.
Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and with a mournful shaking of
his head, glanced anxiously towards the door.

It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy,
came darting in, and putting her arms about his neck, and
often kissing him, addressed him as her "Dear, dear
brother."

"I have come to bring you home, dear brother!" said the
child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh.
"To bring you home, home, home!"

"Home, little Fan?" returned the boy.

"Yes!" said the child, brimful of glee. "Home, for good
and all. Home, for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder
than he used to be, that home's like Heaven! He spoke so
gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that
I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach
to bring you. And you're to be a man!" said the child,
opening her eyes, "and are never to come back here; but
first, we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have
the merriest time in all the world."

"You are quite a woman, little Fan!" exclaimed the boy.

She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his
head; but being too little, laughed again, and stood on
tiptoe to embrace him. Then she began to drag him, in her
childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loth to
go, accompanied her.

A terrible voice in the hall cried, "Bring down Master
Scrooge's box, there!" and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster
himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious
condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind
by shaking hands with him. He then conveyed him and his
sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best-parlour that
ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial
and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold.
Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a
block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments
of those dainties to the young people: at the same time,
sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of "something"
to the postboy, who answered that he thanked the gentleman,
but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had
rather not. Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied
on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster
good-bye right willingly; and getting into it, drove
gaily down the garden-sweep: the quick wheels dashing the
hoar-frost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens
like spray.

"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have
withered," said the Ghost. "But she had a large heart!"

"So she had," cried Scrooge. "You're right. I will not
gainsay it, Spirit. God forbid!"

"She died a woman," said the Ghost, "and had, as I think,
children."

"One child," Scrooge returned.

"True," said the Ghost. "Your nephew!"

Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind; and answered briefly,
"Yes."

Although they had but that moment left the school behind
them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city,
where shadowy passengers passed and repassed; where shadowy
carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and
tumult of a real city were. It was made plain enough, by
the dressing of the shops, that here too it was Christmas
time again; but it was evening, and the streets were
lighted up.

The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door, and asked
Scrooge if he knew it.

"Know it!" said Scrooge. "Was I apprenticed here!"

They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh
wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two
inches taller he must have knocked his head against the
ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement:

"Why, it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it's Fezziwig
alive again!"

Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the
clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his
hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over
himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and
called out in a comfortable, oily, rich, fat, jovial voice:

"Yo ho, there! Ebenezer! Dick!"

Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly
in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice.

"Dick Wilkins, to be sure!" said Scrooge to the Ghost.
"Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached
to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!"

"Yo ho, my boys!" said Fezziwig. "No more work to-night.
Christmas Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer! Let's
have the shutters up," cried old Fezziwig, with a sharp clap
of his hands, "before a man can say Jack Robinson!"

You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it!
They charged into the street with the shutters--one, two,
three--had 'em up in their places--four, five, six--barred
'em and pinned 'em--seven, eight, nine--and came back
before you could have got to twelve, panting like race-horses.

"Hilli-ho!" cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the
high desk, with wonderful agility. "Clear away, my lads,
and let's have lots of room here! Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup,
Ebenezer!"

Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared
away, or couldn't have cleared away, with old Fezziwig looking
on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if
it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was
swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon
the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry, and
bright a ball-room, as you would desire to see upon a winter's
night.

In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the
lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty
stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial
smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and
lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they
broke. In came all the young men and women employed in
the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin, the
baker. In came the cook, with her brother's particular friend,
the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was
suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying
to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who
was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.
In they all came, one after another; some shyly, some boldly,
some gracefully, some awkwardly, some pushing, some pulling;
in they all came, anyhow and everyhow. Away they all went,
twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again
the other way; down the middle and up again; round
and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old
top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top
couple starting off again, as soon as they got there; all top
couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them! When
this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his
hands to stop the dance, cried out, "Well done!" and the
fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter, especially
provided for that purpose. But scorning rest, upon his
reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no
dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home,
exhausted, on a shutter, and he were a bran-new man
resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.

There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more
dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there
was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece
of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer.
But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast
and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind! The sort
of man who knew his business better than you or I could
have told it him!) struck up "Sir Roger de Coverley."  Then
old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top
couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them;
three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were
not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no
notion of walking.

But if they had been twice as many--ah, four times--old
Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would
Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner
in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me
higher, and I'll use it. A positive light appeared to issue
from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the
dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given
time, what would have become of them next. And when old
Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance;
advance and retire, both hands to your partner, bow and
curtsey, corkscrew, thread-the-needle, and back again to
your place; Fezziwig "cut"--cut so deftly, that he appeared
to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without
a stagger.

When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up.
Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side
of the door, and shaking hands with every person individually
as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas.
When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did
the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away,
and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a
counter in the back-shop.

During the whole of this time, Scrooge had acted like a
man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene,
and with his former self. He corroborated everything,
remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent
the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the
bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from
them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious
that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its
head burnt very clear.

"A small matter," said the Ghost, "to make these silly
folks so full of gratitude."

"Small!" echoed Scrooge.

The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices,
who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig:
and when he had done so, said,

"Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of
your mortal money: three or four perhaps. Is that so
much that he deserves this praise?"

"It isn't that," said Scrooge, heated by the remark, and
speaking unconsciously like his former, not his latter, self.
"It isn't that, Spirit. He has the power to render us happy
or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a
pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and
looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is
impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness
he gives, is quite as great as if it cost a fortune."

He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped.

"What is the matter?" asked the Ghost.

"Nothing particular," said Scrooge.

"Something, I think?" the Ghost insisted.

"No," said Scrooge, "No. I should like to be able to say
a word or two to my clerk just now. That's all."

His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance
to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by
side in the open air.

"My time grows short," observed the Spirit. "Quick!"

This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he
could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again
Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime
of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later
years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.
There was an eager, greedy, restless motion in the eye, which
showed the passion that had taken root, and where the
shadow of the growing tree would fall.

He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young
girl in a mourning-dress: in whose eyes there were tears,
which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of
Christmas Past.

"It matters little," she said, softly. "To you, very little.
Another idol has displaced me; and if it can cheer and comfort
you in time to come, as I would have tried to do, I have
no just cause to grieve."

"What Idol has displaced you?" he rejoined.

"A golden one."

"This is the even-handed dealing of the world!" he said.
"There is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and
there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity
as the pursuit of wealth!"

"You fear the world too much," she answered, gently.
"All your other hopes have merged into the hope of being
beyond the chance of its sordid reproach. I have seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-passion,
Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?"

"What then?" he retorted. "Even if I have grown so
much wiser, what then? I am not changed towards you."

She shook her head.

"Am I?"

"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we were
both poor and content to be so, until, in good season, we could
improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry. You
are changed. When it was made, you were another man."

"I was a boy," he said impatiently.

"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you
are," she returned. "I am. That which promised happiness
when we were one in heart, is fraught with misery now that
we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of
this, I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it,
and can release you."

"Have I ever sought release?"

"In words. No. Never."

"In what, then?"

"In a changed nature; in an altered spirit; in another
atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
sight. If this had never been between us," said the girl,
looking mildly, but with steadiness, upon him; "tell me,
would you seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!"

He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition, in
spite of himself. But he said with a struggle, "You think
not."

"I would gladly think otherwise if I could," she answered,
"Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this,
I know how strong and irresistible it must be. But if you
were free to-day, to-morrow, yesterday, can even I believe
that you would choose a dowerless girl--you who, in your
very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or,
choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your
one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your
repentance and regret would surely follow? I do; and I
release you. With a full heart, for the love of him you
once were."

He was about to speak; but with her head turned from
him, she resumed.

"You may--the memory of what is past half makes me
hope you will--have pain in this. A very, very brief time,
and you will dismiss the recollection of it, gladly, as an
unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you
awoke. May you be happy in the life you have chosen!"

She left him, and they parted.

"Spirit!" said Scrooge, "show me no more! Conduct
me home. Why do you delight to torture me?"

"One shadow more!" exclaimed the Ghost.

"No more!" cried Scrooge. "No more. I don't wish to
see it. Show me no more!"

But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms,
and forced him to observe what happened next.

They were in another scene and place; a room, not very
large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter
fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge
believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely
matron, sitting opposite her daughter. The noise in this
room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children
there, than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count;
and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not
forty children conducting themselves like one, but every
child was conducting itself like forty. The consequences
were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care;
on the contrary, the mother and daughter laughed heartily,
and enjoyed it very much; and the latter, soon beginning to
mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands
most ruthlessly. What would I not have given to be one of
them! Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I
wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that
braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little
shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to
save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they
did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should
have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment,
and never come straight again. And yet I should
have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have
questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have
looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never
raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of
which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should
have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest licence
of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its
value.

But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a
rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and
plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed
and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father, who
came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys
and presents. Then the shouting and the struggling, and
the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter!
The scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his
pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight
by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pommel his back,
and kick his legs in irrepressible affection! The shouts of
wonder and delight with which the development of every
package was received! The terrible announcement that the
baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying-pan
into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having
swallowed a fictitious turkey, glued on a wooden platter!
The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy,
and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike.
It is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions
got out of the parlour, and by one stair at a time, up to the
top of the house; where they went to bed, and so subsided.

And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever,
when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning
fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his
own fireside; and when he thought that such another
creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might
have called him father, and been a spring-time in the
haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.

"Belle," said the husband, turning to his wife with a
smile, "I saw an old friend of yours this afternoon."

"Who was it?"

"Guess!"

"How can I? Tut, don't I know?" she added in the
same breath, laughing as he laughed. "Mr. Scrooge."

"Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as
it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could
scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point
of death, I hear; and there he sat alone. Quite alone in
the world, I do believe."

"Spirit!" said Scrooge in a broken voice, "remove me
from this place."

"I told you these were shadows of the things that have
been," said the Ghost. "That they are what they are, do
not blame me!"

"Remove me!" Scrooge exclaimed, "I cannot bear it!"

He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon
him with a face, in which in some strange way there were
fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it.

"Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!"

In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which
the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was
undisturbed by any effort of its adversary, Scrooge observed
that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly
connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the
extinguisher-cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down
upon its head.

The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher
covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down
with all his force, he could not hide the light: which streamed
from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.

He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an
irresistible drowsiness; and, further, of being in his own
bedroom.  He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand
relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank
into a heavy sleep.


STAVE III:  THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS

AWAKING in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and
sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together, Scrooge had
no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the
stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness
in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding
a conference with the second messenger despatched to him
through Jacob Marley's intervention. But finding that he
turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which
of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put
them every one aside with his own hands; and lying down
again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For
he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its
appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise, and
made nervous.

Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves
on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually
equal to the time-of-day, express the wide range of their
capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for
anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which
opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and
comprehensive range of subjects. Without venturing for
Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you
to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of
strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and
rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.

Now, being prepared for almost anything, he was not by
any means prepared for nothing; and, consequently, when the
Bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a
violent fit of trembling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter
of an hour went by, yet nothing came. All this time, he lay
upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy
light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the
hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than
a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it
meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive
that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of
spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of
knowing it. At last, however, he began to think--as you or
I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not
in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done
in it, and would unquestionably have done it too--at last, I
say, he began to think that the source and secret of this
ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence,
on further tracing it, it seemed to shine. This idea taking
full possession of his mind, he got up softly and shuffled in
his slippers to the door.

The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock, a strange
voice called him by his name, and bade him enter. He
obeyed.

It was his own room. There was no doubt about that.
But it had undergone a surprising transformation. The walls
and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a
perfect grove; from every part of which, bright gleaming
berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly, mistletoe, and
ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had
been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring
up the chimney, as that dull petrification of a hearth had
never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and
many a winter season gone. Heaped up on the floor, to form
a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry, brawn,
great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages,
mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts,
cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears,
immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that
made the chamber dim with their delicious steam. In easy
state upon this couch, there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to
see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's
horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge,
as he came peeping round the door.

"Come in!" exclaimed the Ghost. "Come in! and know
me better, man!"

Scrooge entered timidly, and hung his head before this
Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and
though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like
to meet them.

"I am the Ghost of Christmas Present," said the Spirit.
"Look upon me!"

Scrooge reverently did so. It was clothed in one simple
green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment
hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was
bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any
artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the
garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other
covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining
icicles. Its dark brown curls were long and free; free as its
genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice,
its unconstrained demeanour, and its joyful air. Girded
round its middle was an antique scabbard; but no sword
was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.

"You have never seen the like of me before!" exclaimed
the Spirit.

"Never," Scrooge made answer to it.

"Have never walked forth with the younger members of
my family; meaning (for I am very young) my elder brothers
born in these later years?" pursued the Phantom.

"I don't think I have," said Scrooge. "I am afraid I have
not. Have you had many brothers, Spirit?"

"More than eighteen hundred," said the Ghost.

"A tremendous family to provide for!" muttered Scrooge.

The Ghost of Christmas Present rose.

"Spirit," said Scrooge submissively, "conduct me where
you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learnt
a lesson which is working now. To-night, if you have aught
to teach me, let me profit by it."

"Touch my robe!"

Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast.

Holly, mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game,
poultry, brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings,
fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly. So did the room,
the fire, the ruddy glow, the hour of night, and they stood
in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the
weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and
not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the
pavement in front of their dwellings, and from the tops of
their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see
it come plumping down into the road below, and splitting
into artificial little snow-storms.

The house fronts looked black enough, and the windows
blacker, contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow
upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground;
which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by
the heavy wheels of carts and waggons; furrows that crossed
and re-crossed each other hundreds of times where the great
streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace
in the thick yellow mud and icy water. The sky was gloomy,
and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist,
half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended
in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great
Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away
to their dear hearts' content. There was nothing very cheerful
in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of
cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest
summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain.

For, the people who were shovelling away on the housetops
were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another
from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious
snowball--better-natured missile far than many a wordy jest--
laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it
went wrong. The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the
fruiterers' were radiant in their glory. There were great, round,
pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats
of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out
into the street in their apoplectic opulence. There were
ruddy, brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish Onions, shining in
the fatness of their growth like Spanish Friars, and winking
from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went
by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were
pears and apples, clustered high in blooming pyramids; there
were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence
to dangle from conspicuous hooks, that people's mouths might
water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy
and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among
the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered
leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squat and swarthy, setting
off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great
compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and
beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after
dinner. The very gold and silver fish, set forth among
these choice fruits in a bowl, though members of a dull and
stagnant-blooded race, appeared to know that there was
something going on; and, to a fish, went gasping round and
round their little world in slow and passionless excitement.

The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps
two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such
glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the
counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller
parted company so briskly, or that the canisters were rattled
up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended
scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even
that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so
extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight,
the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and
spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on
feel faint and subsequently bilious. Nor was it that the figs
were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in
modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that
everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but
the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful
promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other
at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left
their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to
fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in
the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people
were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which
they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,
worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws
to peck at if they chose.

But soon the steeples called good people all, to church and
chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in
their best clothes, and with their gayest faces. And at the
same time there emerged from scores of bye-streets, lanes, and
nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners
to the bakers' shops. The sight of these poor revellers
appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with
Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway, and taking off the
covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their
dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind
of torch, for once or twice when there were angry words
between some dinner-carriers who had jostled each other, he
shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good
humour was restored directly. For they said, it was a shame
to quarrel upon Christmas Day. And so it was! God love
it, so it was!

In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and
yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners
and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of
wet above each baker's oven; where the pavement smoked as
if its stones were cooking too.

"Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from
your torch?" asked Scrooge.

"There is. My own."

"Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?"
asked Scrooge.

"To any kindly given. To a poor one most."

"Why to a poor one most?" asked Scrooge.

"Because it needs it most."

"Spirit," said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, "I wonder
you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should
desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent
enjoyment."

"I!" cried the Spirit.

"You would deprive them of their means of dining every
seventh day, often the only day on which they can be said
to dine at all," said Scrooge. "Wouldn't you?"

"I!" cried the Spirit.

"You seek to close these places on the Seventh Day?" said
Scrooge. "And it comes to the same thing."

"I seek!" exclaimed the Spirit.

"Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your
name, or at least in that of your family," said Scrooge.

"There are some upon this earth of yours," returned the Spirit,
"who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion,
pride, ill-will, hatred, envy, bigotry, and selfishness
in our name, who are as strange to us and all our kith and
kin, as if they had never lived. Remember that, and charge
their doings on themselves, not us."

Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on,
invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the
town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which
Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding
his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place
with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as
gracefully and like a supernatural creature, as it was possible
he could have done in any lofty hall.

And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in
showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind,
generous, hearty nature, and his sympathy with all poor
men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he
went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and
on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped
to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprinkling of his
torch. Think of that! Bob had but fifteen "Bob" a-week
himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copies of his
Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present
blessed his four-roomed house!

Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out
but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons,
which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence; and
she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of
her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter
Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and
getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar (Bob's private
property, conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the
day) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly
attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks.
And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing
in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the
goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious
thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced
about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the
skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked
him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes bubbling up,
knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and
peeled.

"What has ever got your precious father then?" said Mrs.
Cratchit. "And your brother, Tiny Tim! And Martha
warn't as late last Christmas Day by half-an-hour?"

"Here's Martha, mother!" said a girl, appearing as she
spoke.

"Here's Martha, mother!" cried the two young Cratchits.
"Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!"

"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!"
said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off
her shawl and bonnet for her with officious zeal.

"We'd a deal of work to finish up last night," replied the
girl, "and had to clear away this morning, mother!"

"Well! Never mind so long as you are come," said Mrs.
Cratchit. "Sit ye down before the fire, my dear, and have
a warm, Lord bless ye!"

"No, no! There's father coming," cried the two young
Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. "Hide, Martha,
hide!"

So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father,
with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe,
hanging down before him; and his threadbare clothes darned
up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny Tim upon his
shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and
had his limbs supported by an iron frame!

"Why, where's our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking
round.

"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.

"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his
high spirits; for he had been Tim's blood horse all the way
from church, and had come home rampant. "Not coming
upon Christmas Day!"

Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only
in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet
door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits
hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house,
that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.

"And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit,
when she had rallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had
hugged his daughter to his heart's content.

"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he
gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,
that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he
was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember
upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk, and blind
men see."

Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and
trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing
strong and hearty.

His active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back
came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by
his brother and sister to his stool before the fire; and while
Bob, turning up his cuffs--as if, poor fellow, they were
capable of being made more shabby--compounded some hot
mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round
and round and put it on the hob to simmer; Master Peter,
and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the
goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.

Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose
the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a
black swan was a matter of course--and in truth it was
something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made
the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot;
Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour;
Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce; Martha dusted
the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny
corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for
everybody, not forgetting themselves, and mounting guard
upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be
helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was
said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs.
Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared
to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the
long expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of
delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim,
excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with
the handle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!

There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe
there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and
flavour, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal
admiration. Eked out by apple-sauce and mashed potatoes,
it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as
Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small
atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at
last! Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest
Cratchits in particular, were steeped in sage and onion to
the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss
Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone--too nervous to
bear witnesses--to take the pudding up and bring it in.

Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should
break in turning out! Suppose somebody should have got
over the wall of the back-yard, and stolen it, while they
were merry with the goose--a supposition at which the two
young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were
supposed.

Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of
the copper. A smell like a washing-day! That was the
cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastrycook's next
door to each other, with a laundress's next door to that!
That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit
entered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding,
like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half
of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy, and bedight with
Christmas holly stuck into the top.

Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly
too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by
Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that
now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had
had her doubts about the quantity of flour. Everybody had
something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it
was at all a small pudding for a large family. It would have
been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed
to hint at such a thing.

At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the
hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the
jug being tasted, and considered perfect, apples and oranges
were put upon the table, and a shovel-full of chestnuts on the
fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth, in
what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and
at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass.
Two tumblers, and a custard-cup without a handle.

These held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as
golden goblets would have done; and Bob served it out with
beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and
cracked noisily. Then Bob proposed:

"A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!"

Which all the family re-echoed.

"God bless us every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.

He sat very close to his father's side upon his little
stool. Bob held his withered little hand in his, as if he
loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and
dreaded that he might be taken from him.

"Spirit," said Scrooge, with an interest he had never felt
before, "tell me if Tiny Tim will live."

"I see a vacant seat," replied the Ghost, "in the poor
chimney-corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully
preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future,
the child will die."

"No, no," said Scrooge. "Oh, no, kind Spirit! say he
will be spared."

"If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, none
other of my race," returned the Ghost, "will find him here.
What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population."

Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by
the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief.

"Man," said the Ghost, "if man you be in heart, not
adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered
What the surplus is, and Where it is. Will you decide what
men shall live, what men shall die? It may be, that in the
sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live
than millions like this poor man's child. Oh God! to hear
the Insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life
among his hungry brothers in the dust!"

Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke, and trembling cast
his eyes upon the ground. But he raised them speedily, on
hearing his own name.

"Mr. Scrooge!" said Bob; "I'll give you Mr. Scrooge, the
Founder of the Feast!"

"The Founder of the Feast indeed!" cried Mrs. Cratchit,
reddening. "I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece
of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good
appetite for it."

"My dear," said Bob, "the children! Christmas Day."

"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure," said she, "on
which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy, hard,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge. You know he is, Robert!
Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!"

"My dear," was Bob's mild answer, "Christmas Day."

"I'll drink his health for your sake and the Day's," said
Mrs. Cratchit, "not for his. Long life to him! A merry
Christmas and a happy new year! He'll be very merry and
very happy, I have no doubt!"

The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of
their proceedings which had no heartiness. Tiny Tim drank
it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it. Scrooge
was the Ogre of the family. The mention of his name cast
a dark shadow on the party, which was not dispelled for full
five minutes.

After it had passed away, they were ten times merrier than
before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done
with. Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his
eye for Master Peter, which would bring in, if obtained, full
five-and-sixpence weekly. The two young Cratchits laughed
tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business;
and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from
between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt
of that bewildering income. Martha, who was a poor
apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work
she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch,
and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a
good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at
home. Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some
days before, and how the lord "was much about as tall as
Peter;" at which Peter pulled up his collars so high that you
couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this
time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and
by-and-bye they had a song, about a lost child travelling in
the snow, from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice,
and sang it very well indeed.

There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not
a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes
were far from being water-proof; their clothes were scanty;
and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside
of a pawnbroker's. But, they were happy, grateful, pleased
with one another, and contented with the time; and when
they faded, and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings
of the Spirit's torch at parting, Scrooge had his eye upon
them, and especially on Tiny Tim, until the last.

By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty
heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets,
the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and
all sorts of rooms, was wonderful. Here, the flickering of
the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner, with hot
plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep
red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.
There all the children of the house were running out
into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins,
uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again,
were shadows on the window-blind of guests assembling; and
there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted,
and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near
neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw
them enter--artful witches, well they knew it--in a glow!

But, if you had judged from the numbers of people on
their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought
that no one was at home to give them welcome when they
got there, instead of every house expecting company, and
piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how
the Ghost exulted! How it bared its breadth of breast, and
opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring, with
a generous hand, its bright and harmless mirth on everything
within its reach! The very lamplighter, who ran on before,
dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was
dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly
as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter
that he had any company but Christmas!

And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they
stood upon a bleak and desert moor, where monstrous masses
of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place
of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed,
or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner;
and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse rank grass.
Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery
red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a
sullen eye, and frowning lower, lower, lower yet, was lost in
the thick gloom of darkest night.

"What place is this?" asked Scrooge.

"A place where Miners live, who labour in the bowels of
the earth," returned the Spirit. "But they know me. See!"

A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they
advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and
stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a
glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their
children and their children's children, and another generation
beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.
The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling
of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a
Christmas song--it had been a very old song when he was a
boy--and from time to time they all joined in the chorus.
So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite
blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour
sank again.

The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his
robe, and passing on above the moor, sped--whither? Not
to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror, looking back, he saw
the last of the land, a frightful range of rocks, behind them;
and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water, as it
rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it
had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.

Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks, some league
or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed,
the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse.
Great heaps of sea-weed clung to its base, and storm-birds
--born of the wind one might suppose, as sea-weed of the
water--rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.

But even here, two men who watched the light had made
a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed
out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their
horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they
wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and
one of them: the elder, too, with his face all damaged and
scarred with hard weather, as the figure-head of an old ship
might be: struck up a sturdy song that was like a Gale in
itself.

Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea
--on, on--until, being far away, as he told Scrooge, from any
shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman
at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who
had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations;
but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or
had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his
companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward
hopes belonging to it. And every man on board, waking or
sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for another
on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared
to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those
he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted
to remember him.

It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the
moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it
was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown
abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as Death: it
was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear
a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge
to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a
bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling
by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving
affability!

"Ha, ha!" laughed Scrooge's nephew. "Ha, ha, ha!"

If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a
man more blest in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can
say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me,
and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.

It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that
while there is infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing
in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and
good-humour. When Scrooge's nephew laughed in this way: holding
his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the
most extravagant contortions: Scrooge's niece, by marriage,
laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends being
not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.

"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!"

"He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!" cried
Scrooge's nephew. "He believed it too!"

"More shame for him, Fred!" said Scrooge's niece,
indignantly. Bless those women; they never do anything by
halves. They are always in earnest.

She was very pretty: exceedingly pretty. With a dimpled,
surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that
seemed made to be kissed--as no doubt it was; all kinds of
good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another
when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever
saw in any little creature's head. Altogether she was what
you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory, too.
Oh, perfectly satisfactory.

"He's a comical old fellow," said Scrooge's nephew, "that's
the truth: and not so pleasant as he might be. However,
his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing
to say against him."

"I'm sure he is very rich, Fred," hinted Scrooge's niece.
"At least you always tell me so."

"What of that, my dear!" said Scrooge's nephew. "His
wealth is of no use to him. He don't do any good with it.
He don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the
satisfaction of thinking--ha, ha, ha!--that he is ever going
to benefit US with it."

"I have no patience with him," observed Scrooge's niece.
Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed
the same opinion.

"Oh, I have!" said Scrooge's nephew. "I am sorry for
him; I couldn't be angry with him if I tried. Who suffers
by his ill whims! Himself, always. Here, he takes it into
his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us.
What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner."

"Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner," interrupted
Scrooge's niece. Everybody else said the same, and they
must be allowed to have been competent judges, because
they had just had dinner; and, with the dessert upon the
table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight.

"Well! I'm very glad to hear it," said Scrooge's nephew,
"because I haven't great faith in these young housekeepers.
What do you say, Topper?"

Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's
sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast,
who had no right to express an opinion on the subject.
Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister--the plump one with the lace
tucker: not the one with the roses--blushed.

"Do go on, Fred," said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.
"He never finishes what he begins to say! He is such a
ridiculous fellow!"

Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was
impossible to keep the infection off; though the plump sister
tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar; his example was
unanimously followed.

"I was only going to say," said Scrooge's nephew, "that
the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making
merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant
moments, which could do him no harm. I am sure he loses
pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts,
either in his mouldy old office, or his dusty chambers. I
mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he
likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas
till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it--I defy
him--if he finds me going there, in good temper, year after
year, and saying Uncle Scrooge, how are you? If it only
puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds,
that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday."

It was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking
Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much
caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any
rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the
bottle joyously.

After tea, they had some music. For they were a musical
family, and knew what they were about, when they sung a
Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper, who
could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never
swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face
over it. Scrooge's niece played well upon the harp; and
played among other tunes a simple little air (a mere nothing:
you might learn to whistle it in two minutes), which had
been familiar to the child who fetched Scrooge from the
boarding-school, as he had been reminded by the Ghost of
Christmas Past. When this strain of music sounded, all the
things that Ghost had shown him, came upon his mind; he
softened more and more; and thought that if he could have
listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the
kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands,
without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob
Marley.

But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After
a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children
sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its
mighty Founder was a child himself. Stop! There was first
a game at blind-man's buff. Of course there was. And I
no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he
had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done
thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the
Ghost of Christmas Present knew it. The way he went after
that plump sister in the lace tucker, was an outrage on the
credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons,
tumbling over the chairs, bumping against the piano,
smothering himself among the curtains, wherever she went,
there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.
He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up
against him (as some of them did), on purpose, he would
have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would
have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly
have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister.
She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not.
But when at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her
silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got
her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his
conduct was the most execrable. For his pretending not to
know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her
head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by
pressing a certain ring upon her finger, and a certain chain
about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told
him her opinion of it, when, another blind-man being in
office, they were so very confidential together, behind the
curtains.

Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind-man's buff party,
but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool,
in a snug corner, where the Ghost and Scrooge were close
behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her
love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.
Likewise at the game of How, When, and Where, she was
very great, and to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew, beat
her sisters hollow: though they were sharp girls too, as Topper
could have told you. There might have been twenty people there,
young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for
wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on, that
his voice made no sound in their ears, he sometimes came out with
his guess quite loud, and very often guessed quite right, too;
for the sharpest needle, best Whitechapel, warranted not to cut
in the eye, was not sharper than Scrooge; blunt as he took it in
his head to be.

The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood,
and looked upon him with such favour, that he begged like
a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But
this the Spirit said could not be done.

"Here is a new game," said Scrooge. "One half hour,
Spirit, only one!"

It was a Game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew
had to think of something, and the rest must find out what;
he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case
was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed,
elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live
animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an
animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes,
and lived in London, and walked about the streets,
and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody, and
didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market,
and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a
tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every fresh
question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a
fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that
he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp. At last
the plump sister, falling into a similar state, cried out:

"I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know
what it is!"

"What is it?" cried Fred.

"It's your Uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge!"

Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal
sentiment, though some objected that the reply to "Is it a
bear?" ought to have been "Yes;" inasmuch as an answer
in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts
from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency
that way.

"He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure," said
Fred, "and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health.
Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the
moment; and I say, 'Uncle Scrooge!'"

"Well! Uncle Scrooge!" they cried.

"A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to the old
man, whatever he is!" said Scrooge's nephew. "He wouldn't
take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless. Uncle
Scrooge!"

Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light
of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious
company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech,
if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene
passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his
nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.

Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they
visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood
beside sick beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands,
and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they
were patient in their greater hope; by poverty, and it was
rich. In almshouse, hospital, and jail, in misery's every
refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not
made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his
blessing, and taught Scrooge his precepts.

It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge
had his doubts of this, because the Christmas Holidays appeared
to be condensed into the space of time they passed
together. It was strange, too, that while Scrooge remained
unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older, clearly
older. Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of
it, until they left a children's Twelfth Night party, when,
looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place,
he noticed that its hair was grey.

"Are spirits' lives so short?" asked Scrooge.

"My life upon this globe, is very brief," replied the Ghost.
"It ends to-night."

"To-night!" cried Scrooge.

"To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing
near."

The chimes were ringing the three quarters past eleven at
that moment.

"Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask," said
Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, "but I see
something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding
from your skirts. Is it a foot or a claw?"

"It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it," was
the Spirit's sorrowful reply. "Look here."

From the foldings of its robe, it brought two children;
wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt
down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.

"Oh, Man! look here. Look, look, down here!" exclaimed
the Ghost.

They were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling,
wolfish; but prostrate, too, in their humility. Where
graceful youth should have filled their features out, and
touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled
hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and
pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat
enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No
change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity, in any
grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has
monsters half so horrible and dread.

Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to
him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but
the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie
of such enormous magnitude.

"Spirit! are they yours?" Scrooge could say no more.

"They are Man's," said the Spirit, looking down upon
them. "And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers.
This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware them both,
and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for
on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the
writing be erased. Deny it!" cried the Spirit, stretching out
its hand towards the city. "Slander those who tell it ye!
Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse.
And bide the end!"

"Have they no refuge or resource?" cried Scrooge.

"Are there no prisons?" said the Spirit, turning on him
for the last time with his own words. "Are there no workhouses?"

The bell struck twelve.

Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not.
As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the
prediction of old Jacob Marley, and lifting up his eyes,
beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming, like
a mist along the ground, towards him.


STAVE IV:  THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS

THE Phantom slowly, gravely, silently, approached. When
it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in
the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to
scatter gloom and mystery.

It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed
its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible
save one outstretched hand. But for this it would have been
difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it
from the darkness by which it was surrounded.

He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside
him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a
solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither
spoke nor moved.

"I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet To
Come?" said Scrooge.

The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its
hand.

"You are about to show me shadows of the things that
have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,"
Scrooge pursued. "Is that so, Spirit?"

The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an
instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.
That was the only answer he received.

Although well used to ghostly company by this time,
Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled
beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when
he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as
observing his condition, and giving him time to recover.

But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him
with a vague uncertain horror, to know that behind the
dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon
him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost,
could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap
of black.

"Ghost of the Future!" he exclaimed, "I fear you more
than any spectre I have seen. But as I know your purpose
is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another
man from what I was, I am prepared to bear you company,
and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak
to me?"

It gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight
before them.

"Lead on!" said Scrooge. "Lead on! The night is
waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know. Lead
on, Spirit!"

The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him.
Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him
up, he thought, and carried him along.

They scarcely seemed to enter the city; for the city rather
seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its
own act. But there they were, in the heart of it; on
'Change, amongst the merchants; who hurried up and down,
and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in
groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully
with their great gold seals; and so forth, as Scrooge had
seen them often.

The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men.
Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge
advanced to listen to their talk.

"No," said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, "I
don't know much about it, either way. I only know he's
dead."

"When did he die?" inquired another.

"Last night, I believe."

"Why, what was the matter with him?" asked a third,
taking a vast quantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box.
"I thought he'd never die."

"God knows," said the first, with a yawn.

"What has he done with his money?" asked a red-faced
gentleman with a pendulous excrescence on the end of his
nose, that shook like the gills of a turkey-cock.

"I haven't heard," said the man with the large chin,
yawning again. "Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't
left it to me. That's all I know."

This pleasantry was received with a general laugh.

"It's likely to be a very cheap funeral," said the same
speaker; "for upon my life I don't know of anybody to go
to it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?"

"I don't mind going if a lunch is provided," observed the
gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. "But I must
be fed, if I make one."

Another laugh.

"Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,"
said the first speaker, "for I never wear black gloves, and I
never eat lunch. But I'll offer to go, if anybody else will.
When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't
his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak
whenever we met. Bye, bye!"

Speakers and listeners strolled away, and mixed with
other groups. Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the
Spirit for an explanation.

The Phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed
to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking
that the explanation might lie here.

He knew these men, also, perfectly. They were men of business:
very wealthy, and of great importance. He had made a point
always of standing well in their esteem: in a business point
of view, that is; strictly in a business point of view.

"How are you?" said one.

"How are you?" returned the other.

"Well!" said the first. "Old Scratch has got his own at
last, hey?"

"So I am told," returned the second. "Cold, isn't it?"

"Seasonable for Christmas time. You're not a skater, I
suppose?"

"No. No. Something else to think of. Good morning!"

Not another word. That was their meeting, their
conversation, and their parting.

Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the
Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so
trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden
purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.
They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the
death of Jacob, his old partner, for that was Past, and this
Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any
one immediately connected with himself, to whom he could
apply them. But nothing doubting that to whomsoever they
applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement,
he resolved to treasure up every word he heard,
and everything he saw; and especially to observe the
shadow of himself when it appeared. For he had an expectation
that the conduct of his future self would give him
the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these
riddles easy.

He looked about in that very place for his own image; but
another man stood in his accustomed corner, and though the
clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he
saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured
in through the Porch. It gave him little surprise, however;
for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and
thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried
out in this.

Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its
outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his
thoughtful quest, he fancied from the turn of the hand, and
its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes
were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder, and feel
very cold.

They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part
of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before,
although he recognised its situation, and its bad repute. The
ways were foul and narrow; the shops and houses wretched;
the people half-naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and
archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of
smell, and dirt, and life, upon the straggling streets; and the
whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.

Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed,
beetling shop, below a pent-house roof, where iron, old rags,
bottles, bones, and greasy offal, were bought. Upon the floor
within, were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges,
files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds. Secrets
that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in
mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and
sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a
charcoal stove, made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal,
nearly seventy years of age; who had screened himself from the
cold air without, by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous
tatters, hung upon a line; and smoked his pipe in all the luxury
of calm retirement.

Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this
man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the
shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman,
similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by
a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight
of them, than they had been upon the recognition of each
other. After a short period of blank astonishment, in which
the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three
burst into a laugh.

"Let the charwoman alone to be the first!" cried she who
had entered first. "Let the laundress alone to be the second;
and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third. Look
here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met
here without meaning it!"

"You couldn't have met in a better place," said old Joe,
removing his pipe from his mouth. "Come into the parlour.
You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other
two an't strangers. Stop till I shut the door of the shop.
Ah! How it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal
in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's
no such old bones here, as mine. Ha, ha! We're all suitable
to our calling, we're well matched. Come into the
parlour. Come into the parlour."

The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The
old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and
having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night), with the
stem of his pipe, put it in his mouth again.

While he did this, the woman who had already spoken
threw her bundle on the floor, and sat down in a flaunting
manner on a stool; crossing her elbows on her knees, and
looking with a bold defiance at the other two.

"What odds then! What odds, Mrs. Dilber?" said the
woman. "Every person has a right to take care of themselves.
He always did."

"That's true, indeed!" said the laundress. "No man
more so."

"Why then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid,
woman; who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in
each other's coats, I suppose?"

"No, indeed!" said Mrs. Dilber and the man together.
"We should hope not."

"Very well, then!" cried the woman. "That's enough.
Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these?
Not a dead man, I suppose."

"No, indeed," said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.

"If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old
screw," pursued the woman, "why wasn't he natural in his
lifetime? If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look
after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying
gasping out his last there, alone by himself."

"It's the truest word that ever was spoke," said Mrs.
Dilber. "It's a judgment on him."

"I wish it was a little heavier judgment," replied the
woman; "and it should have been, you may depend upon it,
if I could have laid my hands on anything else. Open that
bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out
plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to
see it. We know pretty well that we were helping ourselves,
before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle,
Joe."

But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this;
and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first,
produced his plunder. It was not extensive. A seal or two,
a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-buttons, and a brooch of no
great value, were all. They were severally examined and
appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed
to give for each, upon the wall, and added them up into a
total when he found there was nothing more to come.

"That's your account," said Joe, "and I wouldn't give
another sixpence, if I was to be boiled for not doing it.
Who's next?"

Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing
apparel, two old-fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of
sugar-tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall
in the same manner.

"I always give too much to ladies. It's a weakness of mine,
and that's the way I ruin myself," said old Joe. "That's
your account. If you asked me for another penny, and made
it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal and knock
off half-a-crown."

"And now undo my bundle, Joe," said the first woman.

Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience
of opening it, and having unfastened a great many knots,
dragged out a large and heavy roll of some dark stuff.

"What do you call this?" said Joe. "Bed-curtains!"

"Ah!" returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward
on her crossed arms. "Bed-curtains!"

"You don't mean to say you took 'em down, rings and
all, with him lying there?" said Joe.

"Yes I do," replied the woman. "Why not?"

"You were born to make your fortune," said Joe, "and
you'll certainly do it."

"I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything
in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as He
was, I promise you, Joe," returned the woman coolly. "Don't
drop that oil upon the blankets, now."

"His blankets?" asked Joe.

"Whose else's do you think?" replied the woman. "He
isn't likely to take cold without 'em, I dare say."

"I hope he didn't die of anything catching? Eh?" said
old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up.

"Don't you be afraid of that," returned the woman. "I
an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for
such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that
shirt till your eyes ache; but you won't find a hole in it, nor
a threadbare place. It's the best he had, and a fine one too.
They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me."

"What do you call wasting of it?" asked old Joe.

"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure," replied
the woman with a laugh. "Somebody was fool enough to
do it, but I took it off again. If calico an't good enough for
such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite
as becoming to the body. He can't look uglier than he did
in that one."

Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror. As they sat
grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by
the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and
disgust, which could hardly have been greater, though they
had been obscene demons, marketing the corpse itself.

"Ha, ha!" laughed the same woman, when old Joe,
producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their
several gains upon the ground. "This is the end of it, you
see! He frightened every one away from him when he was
alive, to profit us when he was dead! Ha, ha, ha!"

"Spirit!" said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. "I
see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own.
My life tends that way, now. Merciful Heaven, what is
this!"

He recoiled in terror, for the scene had changed, and now
he almost touched a bed: a bare, uncurtained bed: on which,
beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up,
which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful
language.

The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with
any accuracy, though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience
to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it
was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon
the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept,
uncared for, was the body of this man.

Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand
was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted
that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon
Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought
of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it;
but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss
the spectre at his side.

Oh cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar
here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy
command: for this is thy dominion! But of the loved,
revered, and honoured head, thou canst not turn one hair
to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious. It is
not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released;
it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the
hand WAS open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm,
and tender; and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow, strike!
And see his good deeds springing from the wound, to sow
the world with life immortal!

No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and
yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He
thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be
his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard-dealing, griping cares?
They have brought him to a rich end, truly!

He lay, in the dark empty house, with not a man, a
woman, or a child, to say that he was kind to me in this
or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be
kind to him. A cat was tearing at the door, and there was
a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearth-stone. What
they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so
restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think.

"Spirit!" he said, "this is a fearful place. In leaving it,
I shall not leave its lesson, trust me. Let us go!"

Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the
head.

"I understand you," Scrooge returned, "and I would do
it, if I could. But I have not the power, Spirit. I have
not the power."

Again it seemed to look upon him.

"If there is any person in the town, who feels emotion
caused by this man's death," said Scrooge quite agonised,
"show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!"

The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a
moment, like a wing; and withdrawing it, revealed a room
by daylight, where a mother and her children were.

She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness;
for she walked up and down the room; started at every
sound; looked out from the window; glanced at the clock;
tried, but in vain, to work with her needle; and could hardly
bear the voices of the children in their play.

At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried
to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was
careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was
a remarkable expression in it now; a kind of serious delight
of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.

He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for
him by the fire; and when she asked him faintly what news
(which was not until after a long silence), he appeared
embarrassed how to answer.

"Is it good?" she said, "or bad?"--to help him.

"Bad," he answered.

"We are quite ruined?"

"No. There is hope yet, Caroline."

"If he relents," she said, amazed, "there is! Nothing is
past hope, if such a miracle has happened."

"He is past relenting," said her husband. "He is dead."

She was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke
truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she
said so, with clasped hands. She prayed forgiveness the next
moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of
her heart.

"What the half-drunken woman whom I told you of last
night, said to me, when I tried to see him and obtain a
week's delay; and what I thought was a mere excuse to avoid
me; turns out to have been quite true. He was not only
very ill, but dying, then."

"To whom will our debt be transferred?"

"I don't know. But before that time we shall be ready
with the money; and even though we were not, it would be
a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his
successor. We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!"

Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter.
The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what
they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier
house for this man's death! The only emotion that the
Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of
pleasure.

"Let me see some tenderness connected with a death," said
Scrooge; "or that dark chamber, Spirit, which we left just
now, will be for ever present to me."

The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar
to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and
there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They
entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had
visited before; and found the mother and the children seated
round the fire.

Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as
still as statues in one corner, and sat looking up at Peter,
who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters
were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet!

"'And He took a child, and set him in the midst of
them.'"

Where had Scrooge heard those words? He had not
dreamed them. The boy must have read them out, as he
and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not
go on?

The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her
hand up to her face.

"The colour hurts my eyes," she said.

The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim!

"They're better now again," said Cratchit's wife. "It
makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak
eyes to your father when he comes home, for the world. It
must be near his time."

"Past it rather," Peter answered, shutting up his book.
"But I think he has walked a little slower than he used,
these few last evenings, mother."

They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a
steady, cheerful voice, that only faltered once:

"I have known him walk with--I have known him walk
with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder, very fast indeed."

"And so have I," cried Peter. "Often."

"And so have I," exclaimed another. So had all.

"But he was very light to carry," she resumed, intent upon
her work, "and his father loved him so, that it was no
trouble: no trouble. And there is your father at the door!"

She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter
--he had need of it, poor fellow--came in. His tea
was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should
help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got
upon his knees and laid, each child a little cheek, against
his face, as if they said, "Don't mind it, father. Don't be
grieved!"

Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to
all the family. He looked at the work upon the table, and
praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls.
They would be done long before Sunday, he said.

"Sunday! You went to-day, then, Robert?" said his
wife.

"Yes, my dear," returned Bob. "I wish you could have
gone. It would have done you good to see how green a
place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I
would walk there on a Sunday. My little, little child!"
cried Bob. "My little child!"

He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he
could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther
apart perhaps than they were.

He left the room, and went up-stairs into the room above,
which was lighted cheerfully, and hung with Christmas.
There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were
signs of some one having been there, lately. Poor Bob sat
down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed
himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what
had happened, and went down again quite happy.

They drew about the fire, and talked; the girls and mother
working still. Bob told them of the extraordinary kindness
of Mr. Scrooge's nephew, whom he had scarcely seen but
once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing
that he looked a little--"just a little down you know," said
Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. "On
which," said Bob, "for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman
you ever heard, I told him. 'I am heartily sorry for it, Mr.
Cratchit,' he said, 'and heartily sorry for your good wife.'
By the bye, how he ever knew that, I don't know."

"Knew what, my dear?"

"Why, that you were a good wife," replied Bob.

"Everybody knows that!" said Peter.

"Very well observed, my boy!" cried Bob. "I hope they
do. 'Heartily sorry,' he said, 'for your good wife. If I
can be of service to you in any way,' he said, giving me
his card, 'that's where I live. Pray come to me.' Now, it
wasn't," cried Bob, "for the sake of anything he might be
able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was
quite delightful. It really seemed as if he had known our
Tiny Tim, and felt with us."

"I'm sure he's a good soul!" said Mrs. Cratchit.

"You would be surer of it, my dear," returned Bob, "if
you saw and spoke to him. I shouldn't be at all surprised--
mark what I say!--if he got Peter a better situation."

"Only hear that, Peter," said Mrs. Cratchit.

"And then," cried one of the girls, "Peter will be keeping
company with some one, and setting up for himself."

"Get along with you!" retorted Peter, grinning.

"It's just as likely as not," said Bob, "one of these days;
though there's plenty of time for that, my dear. But however
and whenever we part from one another, I am sure we
shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim--shall we--or this
first parting that there was among us?"

"Never, father!" cried they all.

"And I know," said Bob, "I know, my dears, that when
we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he
was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among
ourselves, and forget poor Tiny Tim in doing it."

"No, never, father!" they all cried again.

"I am very happy," said little Bob, "I am very happy!"

Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the
two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook
hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from
God!

"Spectre," said Scrooge, "something informs me that our
parting moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not
how. Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?"

The Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come conveyed him, as
before--though at a different time, he thought: indeed, there
seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were
in the Future--into the resorts of business men, but showed
him not himself. Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything,
but went straight on, as to the end just now desired,
until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment.

"This court," said Scrooge, "through which we hurry now,
is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length
of time. I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be,
in days to come!"

The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere.

"The house is yonder," Scrooge exclaimed. "Why do you
point away?"

The inexorable finger underwent no change.

Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked
in. It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was
not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself.
The Phantom pointed as before.

He joined it once again, and wondering why and whither
he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate.
He paused to look round before entering.

A churchyard. Here, then; the wretched man whose name
he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a
worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and
weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up
with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A
worthy place!

The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to
One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was
exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new
meaning in its solemn shape.

"Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,"
said Scrooge, "answer me one question. Are these the
shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of
things that May be, only?"

Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which
it stood.

"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if
persevered in, they must lead," said Scrooge. "But if the
courses be departed from, the ends will change. Say it is
thus with what you show me!"

The Spirit was immovable as ever.

Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and
following the finger, read upon the stone of the neglected
grave his own name, EBENEZER SCROOGE.

"Am I that man who lay upon the bed?" he cried, upon
his knees.

The finger pointed from the grave to him, and back again.

"No, Spirit! Oh no, no!"

The finger still was there.

"Spirit!" he cried, tight clutching at its robe, "hear me!
I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must
have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I
am past all hope!"

For the first time the hand appeared to shake.

"Good Spirit," he pursued, as down upon the ground he
fell before it: "Your nature intercedes for me, and pities
me. Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you
have shown me, by an altered life!"

The kind hand trembled.

"I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it
all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the
Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I
will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I
may sponge away the writing on this stone!"

In his agony, he caught the spectral hand. It sought to
free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty, and detained it.
The Spirit, stronger yet, repulsed him.

Holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate
reversed, he saw an alteration in the Phantom's hood and dress.
It shrunk, collapsed, and dwindled down into a bedpost.


STAVE V:  THE END OF IT

YES! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own,
the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time
before him was his own, to make amends in!

"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!"
Scrooge repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. "The Spirits
of all Three shall strive within me. Oh Jacob Marley!
Heaven, and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say
it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!"

He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions,
that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his
call. He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the
Spirit, and his face was wet with tears.

"They are not torn down," cried Scrooge, folding one of
his bed-curtains in his arms, "they are not torn down, rings
and all. They are here--I am here--the shadows of the
things that would have been, may be dispelled. They will
be. I know they will!"

His hands were busy with his garments all this time;
turning them inside out, putting them on upside down,
tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every
kind of extravagance.

"I don't know what to do!" cried Scrooge, laughing and
crying in the same breath; and making a perfect Laocoön of
himself with his stockings. "I am as light as a feather, I
am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as a schoolboy. I
am as giddy as a drunken man. A merry Christmas to
everybody! A happy New Year to all the world. Hallo
here! Whoop! Hallo!"

He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing
there: perfectly winded.

"There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!" cried
Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace.
"There's the door, by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley
entered! There's the corner where the Ghost of Christmas
Present, sat! There's the window where I saw the wandering
Spirits! It's all right, it's all true, it all happened.
Ha ha ha!"

Really, for a man who had been out of practice for so
many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh.
The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs!

"I don't know what day of the month it is!" said
Scrooge. "I don't know how long I've been among the
Spirits. I don't know anything. I'm quite a baby. Never
mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby. Hallo! Whoop!
Hallo here!"

He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing
out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clang,
hammer; ding, dong, bell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang,
clash! Oh, glorious, glorious!

Running to the window, he opened it, and put out his
head. No fog, no mist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring, cold;
cold, piping for the blood to dance to; Golden sunlight;
Heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious!
Glorious!

"What's to-day!" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a
boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look
about him.

"EH?" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.

"What's to-day, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge.

"To-day!" replied the boy. "Why, CHRISTMAS DAY."

"It's Christmas Day!" said Scrooge to himself. "I
haven't missed it. The Spirits have done it all in one night.
They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of
course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!"

"Hallo!" returned the boy.

"Do you know the Poulterer's, in the next street but one,
at the corner?" Scrooge inquired.

"I should hope I did," replied the lad.

"An intelligent boy!" said Scrooge. "A remarkable boy!
Do you know whether they've sold the prize Turkey that
was hanging up there?--Not the little prize Turkey: the
big one?"

"What, the one as big as me?" returned the boy.

"What a delightful boy!" said Scrooge. "It's a pleasure
to talk to him. Yes, my buck!"

"It's hanging there now," replied the boy.

"Is it?" said Scrooge. "Go and buy it."

"Walk-ER!" exclaimed the boy.

"No, no," said Scrooge, "I am in earnest. Go and buy
it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the
direction where to take it. Come back with the man, and
I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than
five minutes and I'll give you half-a-crown!"

The boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady
hand at a trigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.

"I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's!" whispered Scrooge,
rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. "He sha'n't
know who sends it. It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe
Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's
will be!"

The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady
one, but write it he did, somehow, and went down-stairs to
open the street door, ready for the coming of the poulterer's
man. As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker
caught his eye.

"I shall love it, as long as I live!" cried Scrooge, patting
it with his hand. "I scarcely ever looked at it before.
What an honest expression it has in its face! It's a
wonderful knocker!--Here's the Turkey! Hallo! Whoop!
How are you! Merry Christmas!"

It was a Turkey! He never could have stood upon his
legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a
minute, like sticks of sealing-wax.

"Why, it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,"
said Scrooge. "You must have a cab."

The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with
which he paid for the Turkey, and the chuckle with which
he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed
the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle
with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and
chuckled till he cried.

Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to
shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when
you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the
end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of
sticking-plaister over it, and been quite satisfied.

He dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out
into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth,
as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christmas Present;
and walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded
every one with a delighted smile. He looked so irresistibly
pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows
said, "Good morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!"
And Scrooge said often afterwards, that of all the blithe
sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears.

He had not gone far, when coming on towards him he
beheld the portly gentleman, who had walked into his
counting-house the day before, and said, "Scrooge and Marley's, I
believe?"  It sent a pang across his heart to think how this
old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he
knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it.

"My dear sir," said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and
taking the old gentleman by both his hands. "How do you
do? I hope you succeeded yesterday. It was very kind of
you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!"

"Mr. Scrooge?"

"Yes," said Scrooge. "That is my name, and I fear it
may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness"--here Scrooge whispered in
his ear.

"Lord bless me!" cried the gentleman, as if his breath
were taken away. "My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you serious?"

"If you please," said Scrooge. "Not a farthing less. A
great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you.
Will you do me that favour?"

"My dear sir," said the other, shaking hands with him.
"I don't know what to say to such munifi--"

"Don't say anything, please," retorted Scrooge. "Come
and see me. Will you come and see me?"

"I will!" cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he
meant to do it.

"Thank'ee," said Scrooge. "I am much obliged to you.
I thank you fifty times. Bless you!"

He went to church, and walked about the streets, and
watched the people hurrying to and fro, and patted children
on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into
the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows, and found
that everything could yield him pleasure. He had never
dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so
much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps
towards his nephew's house.

He passed the door a dozen times, before he had the
courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash, and
did it:

"Is your master at home, my dear?" said Scrooge to the
girl. Nice girl! Very.

"Yes, sir."

"Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.

"He's in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I'll
show you up-stairs, if you please."

"Thank'ee. He knows me," said Scrooge, with his hand
already on the dining-room lock. "I'll go in here, my dear."

He turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door.
They were looking at the table (which was spread out in
great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous
on such points, and like to see that everything is right.

"Fred!" said Scrooge.

Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started!
Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting
in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done
it, on any account.

"Why bless my soul!" cried Fred, "who's that?"

"It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner.
Will you let me in, Fred?"

Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off.
He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier.
His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he
came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did
every one when they came. Wonderful party, wonderful
games, wonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!

But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was
early there. If he could only be there first, and catch Bob
Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his
heart upon.

And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No
Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen
minutes and a half behind his time. Scrooge sat with his
door wide open, that he might see him come into the Tank.

His hat was off, before he opened the door; his comforter
too. He was on his stool in a jiffy; driving away with his
pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock.

"Hallo!" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as
near as he could feign it. "What do you mean by coming
here at this time of day?"

"I am very sorry, sir," said Bob. "I am behind my time."

"You are?" repeated Scrooge. "Yes. I think you are.
Step this way, sir, if you please."

"It's only once a year, sir," pleaded Bob, appearing from
the Tank. "It shall not be repeated. I was making rather
merry yesterday, sir."

"Now, I'll tell you what, my friend," said Scrooge, "I
am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer. And
therefore," he continued, leaping from his stool, and giving
Bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into
the Tank again; "and therefore I am about to raise your
salary!"

Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He
had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it,
holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help
and a strait-waistcoat.

"A merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge, with an earnestness
that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the
back. "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I
have given you, for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and
endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we will discuss
your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of
smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another
coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"


Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and
infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was
a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a
master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or
any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old
world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him,
but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was
wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this
globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill
of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these
would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in
less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was
quite enough for him.

He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon
the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was
always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas
well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that
be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim
observed, God bless Us, Every One!

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE

By Jane Austen



Chapter 1


It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
of some one or other of their daughters.

"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"

Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."

Mr. Bennet made no answer.

"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.

"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

This was invitation enough.

"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
be in the house by the end of next week."

"What is his name?"

"Bingley."

"Is he married or single?"

"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

"How so? How can it affect them?"

"My dear Mr. Bennet," replied his wife, "how can you be so tiresome! You
must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them."

"Is that his design in settling here?"

"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
soon as he comes."

"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
party."

"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty."

"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
the neighbourhood."

"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
visit him if you do not."

"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy."

"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference."

"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he; "they are
all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
quickness than her sisters."

"Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."

"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
these last twenty years at least."

"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."

"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
visit them."

"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
all."

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
daughters married; its solace was visiting and news.



Chapter 2


Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
suddenly addressed her with:

"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."

"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother
resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the
assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."

"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
of her."

"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do
not depend on her serving you."

Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her daughters.

"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven's sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."

"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs," said her father; "she times
them ill."

"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kitty fretfully. "When is
your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

"To-morrow fortnight."

"Aye, so it is," cried her mother, "and Mrs. Long does not come back
till the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
for she will not know him herself."

"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
Mr. Bingley to _her_."

"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
myself; how can you be so teasing?"

"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly
very little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
Mrs. Long and her daughters must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
take it on myself."

The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, "Nonsense,
nonsense!"

"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried he. "Do
you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
great books and make extracts."

Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

"While Mary is adjusting her ideas," he continued, "let us return to Mr.
Bingley."

"I am sick of Mr. Bingley," cried his wife.

"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
cannot escape the acquaintance now."

The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
while.

"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
word about it till now."

"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose," said Mr. Bennet; and,
as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.

"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she, when the door was
shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
ball."

"Oh!" said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I'm the tallest."

The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
return Mr. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should ask him to
dinner.



Chapter 3


Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
in various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.

"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,"
said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well
married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about
ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.

An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
six with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
altogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
another young man.

Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
the report which was in general circulation within five minutes
after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
with his friend.

Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
having slighted one of her daughters.

Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
to join it.

"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
dance."

"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
stand up with."

"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Mr. Bingley, "for a
kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
uncommonly pretty."

"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr.
Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."

"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
"She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.

The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's
pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on
the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
different story to hear.

"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most
delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--"

"If he had had any compassion for _me_," cried her husband impatiently,
"he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of
his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"

"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
Hurst's gown--"

Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

"But I can assure you," she added, "that Lizzy does not lose much by not
suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."



Chapter 4


When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
much she admired him.

"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought
likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."

"I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
did not expect such a compliment."

"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
in the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
stupider person."

"Dear Lizzy!"

"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
life."

"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
what I think."

"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
others! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing
of the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man's sisters,
too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his."

"Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
neighbour in her."

Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
ladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
conceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
impressed on their memories than that their brother's fortune and their
own had been acquired by trade.

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
purchase.

His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
immediately.

Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley
had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
but she smiled too much.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
commendation to think of her as he chose.



Chapter 5


Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
disgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
and, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
the world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
James's had made him courteous.

Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
Elizabeth's intimate friend.

That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.

"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte," said Mrs. Bennet with civil
self-command to Miss Lucas. "_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice."

"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better."

"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
sure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
about Mr. Robinson."

"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton
assemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
pretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"

"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
if--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."

"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza," said
Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
is he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_."

"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his
ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."

"Are you quite sure, ma'am?--is not there a little mistake?" said Jane.
"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."

"Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
being spoke to."

"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much,
unless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
agreeable."

"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
the ball in a hack chaise."

"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I
wish he had danced with Eliza."

"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with _him_,
if I were you."

"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him."

"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as pride
often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
to be proud."

"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive
_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_."

"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."

"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with
his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."

"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs.
Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
directly."

The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
would, and the argument ended only with the visit.



Chapter 6


The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on
the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
a wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It
was generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
to _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.

"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose
on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."

"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
discover it too."

"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."

"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
it, he must find it out."

"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
falling in love as much as she chooses."

"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in
question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
enough to make her understand his character."

"Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
remember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
evenings may do a great deal."

"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."

"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
life."

"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."

Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
to dance with.

He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were
assembled.

"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my
conversation with Colonel Forster?"

"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."

"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."

On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
turned to him and said:

"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
Meryton?"

"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic."

"You are severe on us."

"It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going
to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."

"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however,
she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing
at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I
shall keep mine to swell my song."

Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
impatient for display.

Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
dancing at one end of the room.

Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
refinements of polished society."

"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."

Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt
not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."

"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."

"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
you often dance at St. James's?"

"Never, sir."

"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."

"You have a house in town, I conclude?"

Mr. Darcy bowed.

"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
London would agree with Lady Lucas."

He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
her:

"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you."
And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:

"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."

Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.

"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
for one half-hour."

"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.

"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
we cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
partner?"

Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

"I should imagine not."

"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
in this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
I give to hear your strictures on them!"

"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."

Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment.
How long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
joy?"

"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's
imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."

"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."

He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
that all was safe, her wit flowed long.



Chapter 7


Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's
fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
had left her four thousand pounds.

She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
London in a respectable line of trade.

The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing
better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
headquarters.

Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
regimentals of an ensign.

After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
Bennet coolly observed:

"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
I am now convinced."

Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
next morning to London.

"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so
ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."

"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."

"Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
foolish."

"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
I liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in
his regimentals."

"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first
came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."

Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,

"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."

"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.

"MY DEAR FRIEND,--

"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
gentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,

"CAROLINE BINGLEY"

"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
_that_."

"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."

"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.

"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
rain; and then you must stay all night."

"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that
they would not offer to send her home."

"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton,
and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

"I had much rather go in the coach."

"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"

"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose
will be answered."

She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
Jane certainly could not come back.

"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than
once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
brought the following note for Elizabeth:

"MY DEAREST LIZZY,--

"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
to me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
matter with me.--Yours, etc."

"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."

"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."

Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.

"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a
thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
there."

"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want."

"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the
horses?"

"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."

"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every
impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."

"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia.
Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
together.

"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may
see something of Captain Carter before he goes."

In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
glowing with the warmth of exercise.

She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there
was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his breakfast.

Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
her.

When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
fact, nothing to do elsewhere.

When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
of clothes.



Chapter 8


At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very
favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.

Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.

When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
same, and added:

"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
looked almost wild."

"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"

"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
hide it not doing its office."

"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was
all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
escaped my notice."

"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am
inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
an exhibition."

"Certainly not."

"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
a most country-town indifference to decorum."

"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said
Bingley.

"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that
this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."

"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A
short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
no chance of it."

"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."

"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.

"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it
would not make them one jot less agreeable."

"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
their dear friend's vulgar relations.

With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.

"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."

"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great
reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."

"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am
_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."

"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and
I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."

Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
others--all that his library afforded.

"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
than I ever looked into."

Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
in the room.

"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left
so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"

"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."

"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
books."

"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
these."

"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
half as delightful as Pemberley."

"I wish it may."

"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
finer county in England than Derbyshire."

"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."

"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."

"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."

Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
eldest sister, to observe the game.

"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will
she be as tall as I am?"

"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or
rather taller."

"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."

"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience
to be so very accomplished as they all are."

"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"

"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
informed that she was very accomplished."

"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has
too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
acquaintance, that are really accomplished."

"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.

"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your
idea of an accomplished woman."

"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."

"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really
esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
will be but half-deserved."

"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must
yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
extensive reading."

"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."

"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
this?"

"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
application, and elegance, as you describe united."

Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
room.

"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
"is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."

"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
"there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
despicable."

Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled
that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.



Chapter 9


Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the
morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.

Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried
home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.

"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be
moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
a little longer on your kindness."

"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
sure, will not hear of her removal."

"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
"that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
remains with us."

Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.

"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not
know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."

"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I
should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."

"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.

"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.

"Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly."

"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
through I am afraid is pitiful."

"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in
the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a
studier of character. It must be an amusing study."

"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
least that advantage."

"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for
such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
unvarying society."

"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
observed in them for ever."

"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
going on in the country as in town."

Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
victory over him, continued her triumph.

"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"

"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it;
and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

"Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing
at all."

"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her
mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
which you must acknowledge to be true."

"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."

Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if
Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.

"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."

"Did Charlotte dine with you?"

"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
Charlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend."

"She seems a very pleasant young woman."

"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast
of my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
on her, and very pretty they were."

"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has
been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"

"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love," said Darcy.

"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."

Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.

Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own
easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:

"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."

Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes--it would be much better to
wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball," she
added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."

Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the
remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_.



Chapter 10


The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.

Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
exactly in union with her opinion of each.

"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

He made no answer.

"You write uncommonly fast."

"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."

"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"

"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."

"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."

"I have already told her so once, by your desire."

"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
pens remarkably well."

"Thank you--but I always mend my own."

"How can you contrive to write so even?"

He was silent.

"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
Grantley's."

"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
present I have not room to do them justice."

"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"

"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
to determine."

"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
ease, cannot write ill."

"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her
brother, "because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"

"My style of writing is very different from yours."

"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way
imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."

"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."

"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."

"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
indirect boast."

"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?"

"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
panegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"

"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the
foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."

"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better
stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not
go--and at another word, might stay a month."

"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did
not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
more than he did himself."

"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my
friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
could."

"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
himself."

"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
one argument in favour of its propriety."

"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
with you."

"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
either."

"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"

"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
between the parties?"

"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not
forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
when he has nothing to do."

Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
brother for talking such nonsense.

"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument,
and want to silence this."

"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
Darcy had much better finish his letter."

Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.

When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
seated herself.

Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed
on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
him too little to care for his approbation.

After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
Elizabeth, said to her:

"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
opportunity of dancing a reel?"

She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
surprise at her silence.

"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,'
that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
you dare."

"Indeed I do not dare."

Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
should be in some danger.

Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.

"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
which your lady possesses."

"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for
what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"

"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
copied."

At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some
confusion, lest they had been overheard.

"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without
telling us that you were coming out."

Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
and immediately said:

"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
avenue."

But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
laughingly answered:

"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
fourth. Good-bye."

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.



Chapter 11


When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
at their acquaintance with spirit.

But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness
and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and
attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
delight.

When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss
Bennet.

Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
Darcy's progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant
it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
an excellent library."

No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
towards him and said:

"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
pleasure."

"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he
chooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
round my cards."

"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were
carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
the day."

"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
near so much like a ball."

Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
turning to Elizabeth, said:

"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
long in one attitude."

Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
meaning?"--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?

"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe
on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
about it."

Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
two motives.

"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon
as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing
the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret
affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
as I sit by the fire."

"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"

"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We
can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
as you are, you must know how it is to be done."

"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."

"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
laugh."

"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
actions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
life is a joke."

"Certainly," replied Elizabeth--"there are such people, but I hope I
am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
what you are without."

"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
understanding to ridicule."

"Such as vanity and pride."

"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."

Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley;
"and pray what is the result?"

"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
himself without disguise."

"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
for. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
forever."

"_That_ is a failing indeed!" cried Elizabeth. "Implacable resentment
_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."

"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
evil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."

"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody."

"And yours," he replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand
them."

"Do let us have a little music," cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my
waking Mr. Hurst?"

Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for
it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.



Chapter 12


In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive
them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at
length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.

The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.

The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
she felt herself to be right.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
Bingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
should _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
ten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.

On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
all, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last
very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.

They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
Elizabeth.

They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
had dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.



Chapter 13


"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."

"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."

"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."

Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
Bingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
moment."

"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I
never saw in the whole course of my life."

This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.

After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:

"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."

"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
to do something or other about it."

Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.

"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
softened by his manner of expressing himself."

"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
before him?"

"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
head, as you will hear."

"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

"Dear Sir,--

"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--'There, Mrs.
Bennet.'--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
means of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting
on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and
shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight
following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine
is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided
that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.--I
remain, dear sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and
daughters, your well-wisher and friend,

"WILLIAM COLLINS"

"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,"
said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most
conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
indulgent as to let him come to us again."

"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
discourage him."

"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean
to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
credit."

Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady
Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying
his parishioners whenever it were required.

"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him
out.--There is something very pompous in his style.--And what can he
mean by apologising for being next in the entail?--We cannot suppose he
would help it if he could.--Could he be a sensible man, sir?"

"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the
reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his
letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."

"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
think it is well expressed."

To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will,
and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
astonished her husband and daughters.

Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
tall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.

"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
oddly."

"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."

"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
will go when once they come to be entailed."

"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
when we are better acquainted--"

He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The
hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's
heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
cooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
good cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
begged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
herself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
quarter of an hour.



Chapter 14


During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for
his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
a person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
to suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs."

"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and
I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"

"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."

"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"

"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."

"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than
many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"

"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."

"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
court."

"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
pay."

"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you
that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
moment, or are the result of previous study?"

"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
give them as unstudied an air as possible."

Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
in his pleasure.

By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
pages, she interrupted him with:

"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."

Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:

"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."

Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's
interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
for backgammon.



Chapter 15


Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.

Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father's
estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
part.

His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face
confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to
her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."

Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
the day before was now high in her good graces.

Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.

In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
a shop window, could recall them.

But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
of conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
after a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.

Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's
pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
invitation.

Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the
street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She
received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
lieutenant's commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid,
disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.

As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
such behaviour than her sister.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
much attention in the whole course of his life.



Chapter 16


As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their
aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in
the house.

When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
Rosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found
that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
with the housekeeper's room.

In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
The officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.

Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
interesting by the skill of the speaker.

With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.

"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad
to improve myself, for in my situation in life--" Mrs. Phillips was very
glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.

Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
told--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.

"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
understand."

"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear
ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
infancy."

Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"

"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have
spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
disagreeable."

"I have no right to give _my_ opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being
agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."

"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
him more favourably spoken of by anyone."

"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."

"I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.

"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is
likely to be in this country much longer."

"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."

"Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
avoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
memory of his father."

Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.

Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
intelligible gallantry.

"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added,
"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
were speaking of just now."

"Indeed!"

"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
elsewhere."

"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be? How could his
will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"

"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
to it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
of men, and that he hates me."

"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."

"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_."

Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
ever as he expressed them.

"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can
have induced him to behave so cruelly?"

"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon
attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
of preference which was often given me."

"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
this."

After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I _do_
remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
must be dreadful."

"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly
be just to him."

Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To
treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
countenance may vouch for your being amiable"--but she contented herself
with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"

"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
appears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence,
and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself."

"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very
pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
dishonesty I must call it."

"It _is_ wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may
be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
impulses even than pride."

"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"

"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
his father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
as the most attentive and best of brothers."

"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"

He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her
home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
education."

After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
know Mr. Bingley?"

"Not at all."

"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
Darcy is."

"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
for fortune and figure."

The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success was
made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
that she would not make herself uneasy.

"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a
card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
little matters."

Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.

"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him
a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
notice, but he certainly has not known her long."

"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."

"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's
connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
yesterday."

"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."

This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
self-destined for another.

"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."

"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have
not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
understanding of the first class."

Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to
everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.



Chapter 17


Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
otherwise explained.

"They have both," said she, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way
or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
without actual blame on either side."

"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
somebody."

"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such
a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
excessively deceived in him? Oh! no."

"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than
that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
looks."

"It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
think."

"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."

But Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
if he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
became public.

The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet's civilities.

The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
society of her two friends, and the attentions of her brother; and
Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy's look
and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
had no disinclination for it.

"While I can have my mornings to myself," said she, "it is enough--I
think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
everybody."

Elizabeth's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if
he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's
amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
dance.

"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he, "that a ball
of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
cause, and not to any disrespect for her."

Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
for it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own were perforce
delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as
good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.

If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.



Chapter 18


Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's
pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
"I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."

This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.

But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
him was ecstasy.

She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
mind; Charlotte tried to console her:

"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."

"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
evil."

When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding
it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
with:--"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
of the room, or the number of couples."

He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
said.

"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
_now_ we may be silent."

"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"

"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
trouble of saying as little as possible."

"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."

"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"
said he. "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."

"I must not decide on my own performance."

He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just
been forming a new acquaintance."

The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
_retaining_ them, is less certain."

"He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship," replied Elizabeth
with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
his life."

Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
his dancing and his partner.

"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."

The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made
me forget what we were talking of."

"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.

"Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
feelings."

"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."

"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
something else."

"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?" said he,
with a look of doubt.

"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
created_."

"I am," said he, with a firm voice.

"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

"I hope not."

"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
to be secure of judging properly at first."

"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character," said she, endeavouring
to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."

"And what is your success?"

She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different
accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary
greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."

"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."

"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied.
She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards
her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
another.

They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:

"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's
using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really,
considering his descent, one could not expect much better."

"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said
Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can
assure you, he informed me himself."

"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
"Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant."

"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken
if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who has undertaken to make
inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.

"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
you may be sure of my pardon."

"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's,
Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."

"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"

"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."

"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"

"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
him _conditionally_ only."

"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly;
"but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
both gentlemen as I did before."

She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now
in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."

"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"

"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
I believe him to be Lady Catherine's _nephew_. It will be in my power to
assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."

Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
ceased speaking, replied thus:

"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
the highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed
her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed
abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
Collins then returned to Elizabeth.

"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my
reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be
certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."

As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts
she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
chance of it.

In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's
words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.

"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
nothing _he_ may not like to hear."

"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
so doing!"

Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's
eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do
extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
young ladies have time to exhibit."

Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid
her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.

"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
clever, good kind of young man.

To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.

She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice;
though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
it.

The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord,
how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.

When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
day for a short time.

Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.



Chapter 19


The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:

"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
course of this morning?"

Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
want you up stairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
away, when Elizabeth called out:

"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
going away myself."

"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon
Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
escape, she added: "Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
Collins."

Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's
consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
they were gone, Mr. Collins began.

"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."

The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
and he continued:

"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
left Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you
must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the
way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's
decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."

It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.

"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no
answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
decline them."

"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."

"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather
extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
situation."

"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins
very gravely--"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."

"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she
thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
addressed her:

"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
female character."

"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me
exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
to convince you of its being one."

"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."

"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
the truth from her heart."

"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward
gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
being acceptable."

To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.



Chapter 20


Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
warm terms on the happy prospect or their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.

This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
and could not help saying so.

"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be
brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
_make_ her know it."

"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if
she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."

"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is
only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."

She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_."

Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
her communication.

"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had
finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"

"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."

"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."

"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
marrying him."

"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."

Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for
you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was.
"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?"

"I have, sir."

"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"

"Yes, or I will never see her again."

"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
if you _do_."

Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.

"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
_insist_ upon her marrying him."

"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request.
First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
library to myself as soon as may be."

Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
varied, however, her determination never did.

Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.

While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such
fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."

Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone,
"for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
nobody feels for my poor nerves."

Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.

"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned
as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."

Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
together."

Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
conversation: "Oh! Mr. Collins!"

"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point.
Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all
liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."



Chapter 21


The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and
Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
especially to her friend.

The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill
health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.

After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.

"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet
Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
might arise unpleasant to more than myself."

She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and
Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw
her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
Jane, taking out the letter, said:

"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
their way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
shall hear what she says."

She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
house. The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything
I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown
expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as
to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
regard it, in the enjoyment of his.

"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be
able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
them."

"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"

"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
three of whom we shall deprive you."

"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this
winter."

"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_."

"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_."

"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's
partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to
favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
of so many?"

"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she
finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she
suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"

"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"

"Most willingly."

"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
does not care about you."

Jane shook her head.

"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."

"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
herself."

"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."

"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
elsewhere?"

"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature
deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
all means to refuse him."

"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know that
though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
not hesitate."

"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
your situation with much compassion."

"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"

The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's
interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
so totally independent of everyone.

She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.

They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;
but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two
full courses.



Chapter 22


The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good
humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express."
Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards
herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so
favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.

In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
establishment were gained.

Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present
circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short,
were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's
dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
publish his prosperous love.

As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
his engagements might allow him to visit them.

"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
possible."

They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
so speedy a return, immediately said:

"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my
good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
offending your patroness."

"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you
for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."

"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence."

"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
cousin Elizabeth."

With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.

The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her
friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
she could not help crying out:

"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!"

The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
her composure, and calmly replied:

"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,
because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"

But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
all imaginable happiness.

"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised,
very much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's
character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
entering the marriage state."

Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause,
they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers
of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was
not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
chosen.



Chapter 23


Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
houses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:

"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried
him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
most forbearing courtesy.

Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
could at all forgive their daughter.

Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
more foolish than his daughter!

Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
to spread at Meryton.

Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
enough to drive happiness away.

Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
return.

Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
the happiest of men.

Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued
absence.

Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
falsehood.

Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so
dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
the strength of his attachment.

As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.

Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
complained bitterly of all this to her husband.

"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte
Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!"

"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."

This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
making any answer, she went on as before.

"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
not for the entail, I should not mind it."

"What should not you mind?"

"I should not mind anything at all."

"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."

"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own
daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?"

"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.



Chapter 24


Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had
time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
the country.

Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied
the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an
inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's
assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as
she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really
died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether
he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his
observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained
the same, her peace equally wounded.

A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a
longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
not help saying:

"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
all be as we were before."

Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
nothing.

"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have
no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
has done no harm to anyone but myself."

"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your sweetness
and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
deserve."

Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
the praise on her sister's warm affection.

"Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
unaccountable!"

"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and
Charlotte's steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like
regard and esteem for our cousin."

"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
danger security for happiness."

"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied
Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
it does."

"And men take care that they should."

"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."

"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"
said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,
will do the business."

"And do you impute it to either of those?"

"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."

"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?"

"Yes, in conjunction with his friend."

"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
secure it."

"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
connections, and pride."

"Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane;
"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
they should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think
herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
objectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
to part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's
name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day,
"your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
be _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
all expect Jane's good fortune."

"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
the most of it."

Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
had known anything of the matter.

Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.



Chapter 25


After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
letter of thanks.

On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
They had frequently been staying with her in town.

The first part of Mrs. Gardiner's business on her arrival was to
distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
nothing in it.

"I do not blame Jane," she continued, "for Jane would have got Mr.
Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
that she might have been Mr. Collins's wife by this time, had it not
been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
long sleeves."

Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her
sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
conversation.

When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. "It
seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane," said she. "I am
sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."

"An excellent consolation in its way," said Elizabeth, "but it will not
do for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
love with only a few days before."

"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance,
as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's
love?"

"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"

"Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
of service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
anything."

Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
of her sister's ready acquiescence.

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to
this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
unless he really comes to see her."

"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its
impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
never stirs without him."

"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling."

"She will drop the acquaintance entirely."

But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being
withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's
attractions.

Miss Bennet accepted her aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
hoped by Caroline's not living in the same house with her brother,
she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
seeing him.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
made part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth's
warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
an attachment.

To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
before her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
part of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
the death of Darcy's father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
procuring.

Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
of discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
him and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's
treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's
reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.



Chapter 26


Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:

"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."

"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
can prevent it."

"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."

"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does
me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
since we see every day that where there is affection, young people
are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
I will do my best."

"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him."

"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: "very
true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the
necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
you are satisfied."

Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
being given on such a point, without being resented.

Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
she "_wished_ they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day,
and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:

"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."

"_That_ you certainly shall."

"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"

"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
come to Hunsford."

Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
visit.

"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I
hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
welcome as either of them."

The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters
were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most
friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and
Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
for her own visit there to know the rest.

Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.

Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
lost.

"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the
town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."

She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
"I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very
glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
see them soon here."

Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.

Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning
for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
prove what she felt.

"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister,
though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
and think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc."

This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly
regret what he had thrown away.

Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
sincerely wish him happy.

All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."



Chapter 27


With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was
to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
perfect as plan could be.

The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.

The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
and pleasing.

Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of
the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
worn out, like his information.

It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's
door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to
wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and
repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
acquaintance.

Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and
complimented her on bearing it so well.

"But my dear Elizabeth," she added, "what sort of girl is Miss King? I
should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
mercenary."

"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
what to think."

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."

"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death
made her mistress of this fortune."

"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
poor?"

"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
so soon after this event."

"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
why should _we_?"

"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."

"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."

"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
neither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
worth knowing, after all."

"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."

Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.

"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs. Gardiner,
"but, perhaps, to the Lakes."

No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear,
dear aunt," she rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You
give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
travellers."



Chapter 28


Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage;
his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's
offers of refreshment.

Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
modern building, well situated on rising ground.

From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's
help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
forgotten.

She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
in, observed:

"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
_should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."

"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added
Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.

About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
agitation, cried out--

"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
haste, and come down this moment."

Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
garden gate.

"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
daughter."

"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not
Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?"

"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
Why does she not come in?"

"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
when Miss de Bourgh comes in."

"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She
looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
make him a very proper wife."

Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was
stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
way.

At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
to dine at Rosings the next day.



Chapter 29


Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!"

"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William,
"from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."

Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.

When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
preserved."

While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
to his presentation at St. James's.

As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
she could witness without trepidation.

From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.

In spite of having been at St. James's Sir William was so completely
awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.

When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her
being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
her eyes.

After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
looking at in the summer.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic
concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an
occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
observed,

"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss
Bennet?"

"A little."

"Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"

"One of them does."

"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
you draw?"

"No, not at all."

"What, none of you?"

"Not one."

"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."

"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."

"Has your governess left you?"

"We never had any governess."

"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
have been quite a slave to your education."

Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
the case.

"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
must have been neglected."

"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
idle, certainly might."

"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
it was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf's
calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. 'Lady
Catherine,' said she, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your
younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

"Yes, ma'am, all."

"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
must be very young?"

"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon
younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
at the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."

"Upon my word," said her ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly
for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"

"With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elizabeth, smiling, "your
ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."

Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not
conceal your age."

"I am not one-and-twenty."

When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or
having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
and noble names.

When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
Collins's side and as many bows on Sir William's they departed. As soon
as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
Charlotte's sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship's praise
into his own hands.



Chapter 30


Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled,
and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
prevailed upon to get out.

Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.

Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
them into harmony and plenty.

The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This,
however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.

In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him
were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
Miss Lucas and herself.

His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
his uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running
into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:

"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
never have come so soon to wait upon me."

Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
used to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
curtseyed to him without saying a word.

Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
way, and after a moment's pause, added:

"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
happened to see her there?"

She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
away.



Chapter 31


Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
received any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by
such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
only at church.

The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received
them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
much more than to any other person in the room.

Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had
moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
as well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
scruple to call out:

"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."

"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid
a reply.

"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"

Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.

"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
if she does not practice a good deal."

"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice.
She practises very constantly."

"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part
of the house."

Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made
no answer.

When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's
countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:

"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me."

"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not
really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
not your own."

Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."

"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.

"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."

"You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
was at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."

"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
beyond my own party."

"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."

"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an
introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."

"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still
addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
himself to strangers?"

"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to
him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."

"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy,
"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
concerns, as I often see done."

"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the
masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same
force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
capable as any other woman's of superior execution."

Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your
time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."

Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
to Darcy:

"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have
been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."

Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.

Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing
with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was
ready to take them all home.



Chapter 32


Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
to be within.

They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
departure, she observed:

"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?"

"Perfectly so, I thank you."

She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
pause added:

"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
returning to Netherfield again?"

"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
increasing."

"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
principle."

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as
soon as any eligible purchase offers."

Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
trouble of finding a subject to him.

He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable
house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
Collins first came to Hunsford."

"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
kindness on a more grateful object."

"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."

"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."

"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
distance of her own family and friends."

"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."

"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's
journey. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."

"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins
was settled _near_ her family."

"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."

As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:

"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
the present distance."

Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "_You_ cannot
have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
been always at Longbourn."

Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

"Are you pleased with Kent?"

A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
much to anybody, went away.

"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was
gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
have called us in this familiar way."

But when Elizabeth told of his silence; it did not seem very likely,
even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various
conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners,
she believed he might have the best informed mind.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
seemed nothing but absence of mind.

She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would
vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.


In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.



Chapter 33


More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of
Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter,
and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:

"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally
do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
you going much farther?"

"No, I should have turned in a moment."

And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
together.

"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.

"Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
arranges the business just as he pleases."

"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."

"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
dependence."

"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"

"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
they like."

"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
do."

"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
money."

"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the
idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what
is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is
very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."

He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
she soon afterwards said:

"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
likes with her."

"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must
divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."

"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
may like to have her own way."

As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:

"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."

"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
is a great friend of Darcy's."

"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."

"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."

"What is it you mean?"

"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an
unpleasant thing."

"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."

"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"

"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
lady."

"And what arts did he use to separate them?"

"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He
only told me what I have now told you."

Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
was so thoughtful.

"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your
cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"

"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"

"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the
particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
that there was much affection in the case."

"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a
lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.

"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel
Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her
having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
business in London.

"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of
objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of
her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense;
and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
Bingley for his sister.

The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather
displeased by her staying at home.



Chapter 34


When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's
shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation
to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
next--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
her spirits, by all that affection could do.

She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that
his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
mean to be unhappy about him.

While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
in an agitated manner, and thus began:

"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
you."

Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
its being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
suit.

In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did
not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
of a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
cheeks, and she said:

"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
overcoming it after this explanation."

Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings
dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:

"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."

"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire
of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
you--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?"

As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
continued:

"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
of dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
kind."

She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.

"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.

With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying
that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
kinder than towards myself."

Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.

"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike
is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"

"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy,
in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
interest in him?"

"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes
have been great indeed."

"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced
him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
ridicule."

"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in
his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been
overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"

Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
the utmost to speak with composure when she said:

"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
gentlemanlike manner."

She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:

"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
would have tempted me to accept it."

Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:

"From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."

"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
wishes for your health and happiness."

And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying
her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
own case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
pride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
Jane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.



Chapter 35


Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's
sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
of the gates into the ground.

After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
"I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a
slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--

"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
demand it of your justice.

"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to
your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour
attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and
air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
certain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.

"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness
had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
London. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his
affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in
town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it
was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
them.

"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
connection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
than one witness of undoubted veracity.

"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
school, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only
fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he
had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
manner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
unfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.

"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
that his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
business was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
question--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame
me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented
any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which
is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
been complete indeed.

"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
your inclination.

"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
the executors of my father's will, has been unavoidably acquainted
with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
should make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
morning. I will only add, God bless you.

"FITZWILLIAM DARCY"



Chapter 36


If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she
instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
insolence.

But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false!
This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"--and when she had
gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
regard it, that she would never look in it again.

In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions
to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.

The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
entrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
to his real character, had information been in her power, she had
never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But
no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
himself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no
reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
cousin's corroboration.

She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's.
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's
character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
always prevent his exposing the son.

How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
esteemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
sister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
absurd.

"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself
on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."

From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation
_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's
opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were
little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
and manner not often united with great sensibility.

When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
than on hers.

The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
had ever known before.

After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.

She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
leave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
longer an object; she could think only of her letter.



Chapter 37


The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
having them all to dine with her.

Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said? how
would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.

Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure
you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe no one
feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
attachment to Rosings certainly increases."

Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:

"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
company, I am sure."

"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied
Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
next Saturday."

"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
spare you for another fortnight."

"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."

"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan."

Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."

"My uncle is to send a servant for us."

"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
attended to."

Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
recollections.

Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,
what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
forever.

Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's
explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!

When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's
character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.

Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.

When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
hand to both.



Chapter 38


On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.

"I know not, Miss Elizabeth," said he, "whether Mrs. Collins has yet
expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
your time unpleasantly."

Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
solemnity replied:

"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
Lady Catherine's family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."

Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
and truth in a few short sentences.

"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
be able to do so. Lady Catherine's great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
other."

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.

"But," he added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects
delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
while you have been here."

Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
the carriage drove off.

"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems
but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
happened!"

"A great many indeed," said her companion with a sigh.

"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
How much I shall have to tell!"

Elizabeth added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!"

Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner's
house, where they were to remain a few days.

Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know
that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
further.



Chapter 39


It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage
was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's
punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
dressing a salad and cucumber.

After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
"Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"

"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the
money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing
her purchases--"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
better."

And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
are going in a fortnight."

"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.

"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
have!"

"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"

"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at
table. "What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
a certain person we all like!"

Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She
is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."

"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."

"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."

"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.

"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
three straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
thing?"

Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!

As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and
Lydia's purchases, were seated in it.

"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I bought my
bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend
the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for a
lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."

With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.

Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's,
was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her.

"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"

To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear sister,
to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book."

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.

In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
There was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
comfort to _her_ of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond
expression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.

She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.



Chapter 40


Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.

"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly
ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
disappointment!"

"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"

"Blame you! Oh, no."

"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"

"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
day."

She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though
grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
seek to clear the one without involving the other.

"This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to make both
of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's;
but you shall do as you choose."

It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.

"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so
very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
so."

"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
be as light as a feather."

"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"

"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
appearance of it."

"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
used to do."

"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an
opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."

"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
the matter as you do now."

"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
had! Oh! how I wanted you!"

"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
undeserved."

"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
Wickham's character."

Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no
occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"

"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
present I will say nothing about it."

"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."

The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very
improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"

She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
health and their tranquillity.

"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion _now_ of
this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak
of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
a very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there's the least
chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know."

"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more."

"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done."

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
she made no answer.

"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
housekeeping, I dare say."

"No, nothing at all."

"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. _they_ will
take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."

"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."



Chapter 41


The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
hard-heartedness in any of the family.

"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they
often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so,
Lizzy?"

Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
ago.

"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel
Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."

"I am sure I shall break _mine_," said Lydia.

"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.

"Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."

"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."

"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,"
added Kitty.

Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's
objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
interference in the views of his friend.

But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
their _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia
flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's
congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.

"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,"
said she, "Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."

In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general
behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:

"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
circumstances."

"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to
us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and
imprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
would judge differently in the affair."

"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away
some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."

"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
disgrace?"

Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her hand said in reply:

"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
of her life."

With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
disposition.

Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
officers at once.

Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.

But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving
home.

Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
well over; the agitations of formal partiality entirely so. She had even
learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.

On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined,
with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three
weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.

He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:

"How long did you say he was at Rosings?"

"Nearly three weeks."

"And you saw him frequently?"

"Yes, almost every day."

"His manners are very different from his cousin's."

"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."

"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And
pray, may I ask?--" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is
it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
to his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower
and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."

"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much
what he ever was."

While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
and anxious attention, while she added:

"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."

Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
accents:

"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
am certain he has very much at heart."

Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
mutual desire of never meeting again.

When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.



Chapter 42


Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.

Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.

When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little
other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for.
Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
the defence of some little peculiar vexation."

When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
less to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
much too full of lines under the words to be made public.

After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
Meryton.

The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
Dovedale, or the Peak.

Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
and all was soon right again.

With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
owner. "But surely," said she, "I may enter his county with impunity,
and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me."

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
cousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.

The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
disappointments abroad.

It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner's
former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.

"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
so much?" said her aunt; "a place, too, with which so many of your
acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
know."

Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
must own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
many, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.

Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house
richly furnished," said she, "I should not care about it myself; but
the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
country."

Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
absence of the family were unfavourably answered.

Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
alarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.



Chapter 43


Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.

The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
wonder at her being where she was.

The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With
these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"--recollecting
herself--"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."

This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
regret.

She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with
a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!

Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought
up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added;
"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."

Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
return it.

"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
other--about eight years ago."

"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner,
looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
us whether it is like or not."

Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her knowing her master.

"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"

Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little."

"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"

"Yes, very handsome."

"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
be then. He was very fond of them."

This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.

Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
when she was only eight years old.

"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.

"Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
a new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
comes here to-morrow with him."

Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
master and his sister.

"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."

"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."

"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."

"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
good enough for him."

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is
very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."

"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,"
replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have
never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
since he was four years old."

This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
grateful to her uncle for saying:

"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
having such a master."

"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
world."

Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she.

"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
as affable to the poor."

Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever
lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
like other young men."

"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.

"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not
quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."

"Perhaps we might be deceived."

"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."

On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
last at Pemberley.

"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
one of the windows.

Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter
the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever
can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
is nothing he would not do for her."

The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
also more intelligible.

In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
her--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's
lifetime.

There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle
sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!--how
much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
softened its impropriety of expression.

When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.

As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.

They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
of perfect civility.

She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on
beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
distraction of his thoughts.

At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
leave.

The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
for it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
altered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
for it.

They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
composure.

At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.

They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment
was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
and she said no more.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought
she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
fashion."

The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
his taste, or his good manners.

The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can
it proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."

After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
very unexpected--"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They
will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some
who will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters."

Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last
mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
mind was not very differently engaged.

"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a
pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
during your stay at Lambton?"

The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
him think really ill of her.

They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
mile behind.

He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
walking slowly towards the house.

The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
"He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.

"There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her
aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
have seen nothing of it."

"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."

"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham;
or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features
are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
disagreeable?"

Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
seen him so pleasant as this morning.

"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied
her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
his grounds."

Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
said nothing.

"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really
should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
virtue."

Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they
had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.

The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above
all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.



Chapter 44


Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.

She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.

Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
her beyond a monosyllable.

Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
relieved by discerning such different feelings.

They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick
step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.

To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little
in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
evident enough.

Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since
he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply,
he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."

Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
gave them meaning.

It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
Rosings.

Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.

Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was
not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.

Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference
to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.

With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.

As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
his addresses.

It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the
very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.

Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting
some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.



Chapter 45


Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had
originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.

On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.

In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with
all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
however, did her justice, and pitied her.

By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
party--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
them round the table.

While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
regret that he came.

He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the
smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's
entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
They must be a great loss to _your_ family."

In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth
instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;
but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's
meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections
her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
for the welfare of his friend.

Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.

Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person,
behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's
recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.

"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she
cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
that we should not have known her again."

However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
summer.

"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could
see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
wants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
without fashion, which is intolerable."

Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
determination of making him speak, she continued:

"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_
a beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she
seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
one time."

"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but _that_
was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."

He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.

Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's
beginning the subject.



Chapter 46


Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.

They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:

"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
know what I have written."

Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.

"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short
letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
without any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."

"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation,
hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
an instant to lose."

"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute;
but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
not well enough; you cannot go yourself."

Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
mistress home instantly.

On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill."

"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There
is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."

She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane,
with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
sister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever."

Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet
more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
have happened. But it is all--all too late now."

"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved--shocked. But is it
certain--absolutely certain?"

"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
Scotland."

"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"

"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's
immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
nothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"

Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.

"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"

Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
power was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
him, as now, when all love must be vain.

But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been
long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
to-day."

"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."

He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
one serious, parting look, went away.

As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
formerly have rejoiced in its termination.

If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's
change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
otherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must
produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained
a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.

She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
feel it!

She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
could be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost
importance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's
account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
of the last with trembling energy, though Lydia had never been a
favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?"
cried Mrs. Gardiner. "John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?"

"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
_That_ is all settled."

"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"

But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.



Chapter 47


"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they
drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I
am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
not adequate to the risk!"

"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.

"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's
opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
him capable of it?"

"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
the case?"

"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof
that they are not gone to Scotland."

"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
Barnet road."

"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
might strike them that they could be more economically, though less
expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."

"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending
to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's
behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
such a matter."

"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"

"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with
tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such
a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
nay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
greater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
person and address that can captivate a woman."

"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of
Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."

"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."

"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.

"I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the other day,
of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her."

"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
and Jane seem so well to understand?"

"Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the
case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
enough from my thoughts."

"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"

"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
the first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."

                          * * * * *

It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent.
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
no interval of ease or forgetfulness.

They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
by long expectations.

The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.

Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
mother's apartment, immediately met her.

Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
heard of the fugitives.

"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
everything will be well."

"Is my father in town?"

"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."

"And have you heard from him often?"

"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
again till he had something of importance to mention."

"And my mother--how is she? How are you all?"

"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
Heaven, are quite well."

"But you--how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you
must have gone through!"

Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.

When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes'
conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
errors of her daughter must principally be owing.

"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton,
with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
shall do."

They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.

"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be
prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
together as to what is to be done."

"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I
could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
wits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
know you will contrive it all."

But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.

Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
subject.

In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
each other the balm of sisterly consolation."

Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."

Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.

In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which
I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
took place? They must have seen them together for ever."

"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
first got abroad, it hastened his journey."

"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"

"Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
repeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."

"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
a little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him
in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter
she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
being in love with each other, many weeks."

"But not before they went to Brighton?"

"No, I believe not."

"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
he know his real character?"

"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
but I hope this may be false."

"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
this could not have happened!"

"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose
the former faults of any person without knowing what their present
feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."

"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his
wife?"

"He brought it with him for us to see."

Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
were the contents:

"MY DEAR HARRIET,

"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke
it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
drink to our good journey.

"Your affectionate friend,

"LYDIA BENNET."

"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had
finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"

"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
such confusion!"

"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it who
did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
almost took from me my faculties."

"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
upon yourself alone."

"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if
they should be of use to us."

"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she
_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."

She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.

"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where
they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might
be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
out even so much as this."



Chapter 48


The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.

When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.

Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity,
she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
them.

All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family.
Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
them.

Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:

"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
other person."

Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
his companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
was a something to look forward to.

Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters,
whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.

But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
follows:

"MY DEAR SIR,

"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would
have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
own heinous offense.

"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."

Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for
it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!"
she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."

Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and
leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
what her anxiety for his life had been before.

"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he
will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
and make him marry her, if he comes away?"

As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.

Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
received none since her return that could come from Pemberley.

The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
Lydia's infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
one sleepless night out of two.

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
it.

It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say
nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
and I ought to feel it."

"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.

"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
It will pass away soon enough."

"Do you suppose them to be in London?"

"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.

"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there
will probably be of some duration."

Then after a short silence he continued:

"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."

They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's
tea.

"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an
elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."

"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should
ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."

"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."

Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.

"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
them."



Chapter 49


Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon,
madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."

"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."

"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know
there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
this half-hour, and master has had a letter."

Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
library; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
seeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
butler, who said:

"If you are looking for my master, ma'am, he is walking towards the
little copse."

Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.

Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
came up with him, and eagerly cried out:

"Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"

"Yes I have had a letter from him by express."

"Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?"

"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from
his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."

Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.

"Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself what it is
about."

"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.

"MY DEAR BROTHER,

"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
to know they are discovered. I have seen them both--"

"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are married!"

Elizabeth read on:

"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's
circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the
smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as
fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it
best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope
you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

"EDW. GARDINER."

"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be
possible that he will marry her?"

"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her
sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth.

"No; but it must be done soon."

Most earnestly did she then entreaty him to lose no more time before he
wrote.

"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately.
Consider how important every moment is in such a case."

"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."

"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."

And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.

"And may I ask--" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must be
complied with."

"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."

"And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!"

"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
to pay him."

"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?"

"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
gone."

"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me
before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."

"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing
less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
in the very beginning of our relationship."

"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"

Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.

"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"

"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would
not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
pounds?"

"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said
Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
first sees my aunt!"

"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said
Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
time make their past imprudence forgotten."

"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor
I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."

It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
replied:

"Just as you please."

"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"

"Take whatever you like, and get away."

Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon
married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.

"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will
be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"

Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great
measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
assist Mr. Wickham with money."

"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but
her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and
you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed,
would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.

"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."

Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.

Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
gained.



Chapter 50


Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
her husband might then have rested in its proper place.

He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.

When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he
would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within
that sum.

That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
message to her.

The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
was considered certain.

It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
importance.

"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "Mrs.
Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."

A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of
shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
took place.

Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
spot.

She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's
frailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been
concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.

From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
should meet.

What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
there must be a triumph.

She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
must have received benefit of greater importance.

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
family.

How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.

                          * * * * *

Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's
acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
on quitting the militia.

"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as
his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into
the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
you and your mother.--Yours, etc.,

"E. GARDINER."

Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal
from the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North,
just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
with everybody, and had so many favourites.

"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking
to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----'s
regiment."

His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and
consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
have been the last object of her wishes.



Chapter 51


Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
meet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
must endure.

They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
anxious, uneasy.

Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.

Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
there.

Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.

There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
the world.

"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away;
it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
thought it would be very good fun if I was."

Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the
people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."

Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say
to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
lower, because I am a married woman."

It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham"
by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."

"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't
at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"

"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."

"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.

"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
winter is over."

"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not
particularly like your way of getting husbands."

Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
think, than such as did not.

Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her
present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
of having a companion.

Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
the first of September, than any body else in the country.

One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:

"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
curious to hear how it was managed?"

"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said
on the subject."

"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in
that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."

"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe
me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However,
I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."

"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

"Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"

"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."

"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will
ask you no questions."

"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you
all, and then Wickham would be angry."

On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
power, by running away.

But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be
to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
ignorance."

"Not that I _shall_, though," she added to herself, as she finished
the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
out."

Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.



Chapter 52


Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
contain a denial.

"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.

"MY DEAR NIECE,

"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
application; I did not expect it from _you_. Don't think me angry,
however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
inquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
as I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.

"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to
make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.

"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
wished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her
own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
nothing to live on.

"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.

"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
reasonable.

"Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to
make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.

"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.

"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
accused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
uncle would most readily have settled the whole.

"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
at most.

"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
settled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_ reserve,
can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
interest_ in the affair.

"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
then to receive the last finish.

"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.

"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
hour.

"Yours, very sincerely,

"M. GARDINER."

The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's
match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
a woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It
was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
between Mr. Darcy and herself.

She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's
approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
overtaken by Wickham.

"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he,
as he joined her.

"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow
that the interruption must be unwelcome."

"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
now we are better."

"True. Are the others coming out?"

"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
you have actually seen Pemberley."

She replied in the affirmative.

"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."

"Yes, she did."

"And what did she say?"

"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
misrepresented."

"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:

"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."

"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said
Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this
time of year."

"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
understood from the Gardiners that you had."

"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."

"And do you like her?"

"Very much."

"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."

"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."

"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

"I do not recollect that we did."

"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
most delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
me in every respect."

"How should you have liked making sermons?"

"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
repine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
circumstance, when you were in Kent?"

"I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."

"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
first, you may remember."

"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
had been compromised accordingly."

"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."

They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him,
she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
mind."

She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.



Chapter 53


Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
had said enough to keep him quiet.

The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
continue at least a twelvemonth.

"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"

"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."

"Write to me very often, my dear."

"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
do."

Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He
smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.

"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with
one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said
Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
single."

"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If
that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."

But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
smiled and shook her head by turns.

"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs.
Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not
that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
sure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"

"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in
Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."

Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:

"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from
any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
_myself_, but I dread other people's remarks."

Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come
without it.

"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot
come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself."

In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
more unequal, than she had often seen them.

The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you
will wait on him of course."

"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."

His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
Netherfield.

"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society,
let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
again."

"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I
am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
him."

Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--

"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It
would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"

"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it
is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
always so much."

Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
enter the paddock and ride towards the house.

Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
to the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
again by her sister.

"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"

"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
know."

"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with
him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."

"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
say that I hate the very sight of him."

Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either
of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
behaviour in Derbyshire.

The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.

"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early
enough for expectation."

She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's
presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
not an improbable, conjecture.

Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
her curtsey and address to his friend.

Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
applied.

Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
with herself for being so.

"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"

She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
him she had hardly courage to speak.

She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.

"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.

He readily agreed to it.

"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,
George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a
syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"

Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
not tell.

"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,"
continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
many as he deserves."

Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.

"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother,
"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
will save all the best of the covies for you."

Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
moments of such painful confusion.

"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to
be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
one or the other again!"

Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
that she did not always know when she was silent.

When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
Longbourn in a few days time.

"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when
you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
your engagement."

Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.

Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
there that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
of one who had ten thousand a year.



Chapter 54


As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.

"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she,
"did he come at all?"

She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.

"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
think no more about him."

Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.

"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
acquaintance."

"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane,
take care."

"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"

"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
you as ever."

                          * * * * *

They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had
revived.

On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
decided. He placed himself by her.

Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
alarm.

His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his
own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,
made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;
and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
family.

She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.

"If he does not come to me, _then_," said she, "I shall give him up for
ever."

The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of
the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:

"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
do we?"

Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
being so silly!

"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:

"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"

"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."

"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"

"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
these three weeks."

She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering
to Elizabeth again, he walked away.

When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
They were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.

Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.

"Well girls," said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What
say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
Lucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
what do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
at Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
a creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."

Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.

"It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. "The
party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
may often meet again."

Elizabeth smiled.

"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
pleasing, than any other man."

"You are very cruel," said her sister, "you will not let me smile, and
are provoking me to it every moment."

"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"

"And how impossible in others!"

"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"

"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."



Chapter 55


A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.

"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."

He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.

"Can you come to-morrow?"

Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
accepted with alacrity.

He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing
gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:

"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
Lizzy's hair."

"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is
forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."

"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
Where is your sash, my dear?"

But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
without one of her sisters.

The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do
you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"

"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still
five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to
speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
Bennet half-opened the door and called out:

"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."

Elizabeth was forced to go.

"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as
soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
my dressing-room."

Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
into the drawing-room.

Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.

He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.

After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's
concurrence.

Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get
every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.

But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
words to her sister, ran out of the room.

Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.

"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
why is not everybody as happy?"

Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
said for the present.

"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any
account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"

She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
previous months of suspense and vexation.

"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious
circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the
happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"

In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
father had been short and to the purpose.

"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.

"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."

He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;
and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
himself.

It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
how really happy he was.

Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
turned to his daughter, and said:

"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."

Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
goodness.

"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
always exceed your income."

"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
unpardonable in me."

"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you
talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
which she might in future be able to dispense.

Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
obliged to accept.

Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
relief.

"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he
was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
it possible."

"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for
it?"

"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to
his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
can never be what we once were to each other."

"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever
heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."

"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"

"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
modesty."

This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.

"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried
Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
above them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
such another man for you!"

"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."

The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
neighbours in Meryton.

The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.



Chapter 56


One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been
formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the
head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of
introduction had been made.

Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,

"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother."

Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.

"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."

"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."

"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short
silence.

"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."

"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
summer; the windows are full west."

Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
added:

"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
Mrs. Collins well."

"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."

Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.

Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,

"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
will favour me with your company."

"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the
different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."

Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
looking rooms, walked on.

Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
disagreeable.

"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in
her face.

As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
manner:--

"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
come."

Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
for the honour of seeing you here."

"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to
know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
you."

"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring
with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming
so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"

"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."

"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth
coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
is in existence."

"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
report is spread abroad?"

"I never heard that it was."

"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"

"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."

"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
may have drawn him in."

"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."

"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."

"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
ever induce me to be explicit."

"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"

"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
make an offer to me."

Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
hours he was destined for his cousin?"

"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"

"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
by any of us."

"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr.
Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
to repine."

"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's
whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."

"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;
but it will have no effect on me."

"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,
honourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
which you have been brought up."

"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are
equal."

"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
condition."

"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does
not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."

"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"

Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
moment's deliberation:

"I am not."

Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"

"I will make no promise of the kind."

"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
assurance I require."

"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."

"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous
elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a
patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered.
"You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
the house."

And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.

"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"

"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."

"You are then resolved to have him?"

"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."

"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."

"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any
possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's
concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
the scorn."

"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."

In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave
of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."

Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.

"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."

"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"

Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.



Chapter 57


The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
forward to as possible at some future time.

In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help
feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
an application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.

If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.

"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand
it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
at all."

                          * * * * *

The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and
Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.

The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.

"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."

She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
consequent explanations.

She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
then said,

"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."

The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous
conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
herself; when her father continued:

"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."

"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?"

"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus
offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
this land.'

"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" 'This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be
inclined to take immediate advantage of.'

"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:

"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
a friendly eye.'

"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
life! It is admirable!"

Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force
one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
little agreeable to her.

"Are you not diverted?"

"Oh! yes. Pray read on."

"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.
Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad
business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
living together before the marriage took place should be so generally
known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian
forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's
situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
turn?"

"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!"

"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any
consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"

To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but
wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.



Chapter 58


Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's
visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.

They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
high, she immediately said:

"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."

"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
was so little to be trusted."

"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to
me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
sake of discovering them."

"If you _will_ thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone.
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
only of _you_."

Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
me on this subject for ever."

Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
affection every moment more valuable.

They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.

"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."

Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough
of my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
your relations."

"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."

"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
in civility."

"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a
more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can
scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
a way."

"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
way that would induce you to accept me."

"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."

Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you
think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
contents?"

She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
former prejudices had been removed.

"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
justly make you hate me."

"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
changed as that implies."

"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly
calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
dreadful bitterness of spirit."

"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
pleasure."

"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
worthy of being pleased."

"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"

"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
wishing, expecting my addresses."

"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"

"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
a proper direction."

"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"

"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."

"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."

"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in
my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
hour after I had seen you."

He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her
disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
comprehend.

She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
each, to be dwelt on farther.

After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
it was time to be at home.

"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
it.

"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elizabeth.

"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And
though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
the case.

"On the evening before my going to London," said he, "I made a
confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."

Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
friend.

"Did you speak from your own observation," said she, "when you told him
that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"

"From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection."

"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
him."

"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
his reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
in any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
now."

Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
parted.



Chapter 59


"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question
which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.

The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.

At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.

"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."

"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
engaged."

Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
you dislike him."

"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
remember it myself."

Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her of its truth.

"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried
Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
certain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
happy with him?"

"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"

"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
to do?"

"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
tell you all."

"What do you mean?"

"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
afraid you will be angry."

"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
how long you have loved him?"

"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
at Pemberley."

Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
further to wish.

"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself.
I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your
husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
of it to another, not to you."

Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,
and half the night spent in conversation.

                          * * * * *

"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's
way."

Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
epithet.

As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"

"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk
to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
never seen the view."

"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am
sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that
she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:

"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
inconvenience."

During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be
asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother
would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
disapprobation.

                          * * * * *

In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to
be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he
wants you in the library." She was gone directly.

Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
"Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"

How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.

"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
But will they make you happy?"

"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my
indifference?"

"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
this would be nothing if you really liked him."

"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him.
Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
such terms."

"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind
of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
about."

Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months'
suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.

"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to
say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."

To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.

"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him
his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have
paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."

He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come
for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."

Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
would come in time.

When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."

This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
her mother followed her.

"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a
special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
that I may have it to-morrow."

This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman
himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'
consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
deference for his opinion.

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
every hour in his esteem.

"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps,
is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
as Jane's."



Chapter 60


Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. "How could
you begin?" said she. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
place?"

"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
knew that I _had_ begun."

"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
did you admire me for my impertinence?"

"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
of _that_ when they fall in love."

"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
ill at Netherfield?"

"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."

"But I was embarrassed."

"And so was I."

"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."

"A man who had felt less, might."

"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
subject. This will never do."

"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
Catherine's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me
hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."

"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
or had you intended any more serious consequence?"

"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."

"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
befall her?"

"I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
done directly."

"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected."

From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's
long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
follows:

"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
he can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
Yours, etc."

Mr. Darcy's letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
to his last.

"DEAR SIR,

"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.

"Yours sincerely, etc."

Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.

The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were
insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
being loved by her sister.

Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that
Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did
shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Mrs. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good
humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
Pemberley.



Chapter 61


Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example,
she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's
society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite
unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own,
it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

"MY DEAR LIZZY,

"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

"Yours, etc."

As it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he
proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.

Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she
thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
to Elizabeth.

Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters
was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that
a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.

Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,
he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.

With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
